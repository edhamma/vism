Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa’s </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga</emphasis><phrase> is a classic text of the latter type. It represents the epitome of Pali Buddhist literature, weaving together its many strands to create this wonderful meditation manual, which even today retains the clarity it revealed when it was written.</phrase></para><para><phrase>There are occasions when people like to make much of the supposed differences in the various traditions of Buddhism that have evolved in different times and places. What I find especially encouraging about a book such as this is that it shows so clearly how much all schools of Buddhism have fundamentally in common. Within a structure based on the traditional three trainings of ethical discipline, concentration and wisdom are detailed instructions on how to take an ethical approach to life, how to meditate and calm the mind, and on the basis of those how to develop a correct understanding of reality. We find practical advice about creating an appropriate environment for meditation, the importance of developing love and compassion, and discussion of dependent origination that underlies the Buddhist view of reality. The very title of the work, the </phrase><emphasis>Path of Purification,</emphasis><phrase> refers to the essential Buddhist understanding of the basic nature of the mind as clear and aware, unobstructed by disturbing emotions. This quality is possessed by all sentient beings which all may realize if we pursue such a path.</phrase></para><para><phrase>Sometimes I am asked whether Buddhism is suitable for Westerners or not. I believe that the essence of all religions deals with basic human problems and Buddhism is no exception. As long as we continue to experience the basic human sufferings of birth, disease, old age, and death, there is no question of whether it is suitable or not as a remedy. Inner peace is the key. In that state of mind you can face difficulties with calm and reason. The teachings of love, kindness and tolerance, the conduct of non-violence, and especially the Buddhist theory that all things are relative can be a source of that inner peace.</phrase></para><para><phrase>While the essence of Buddhism does not change, superficial cultural aspects will change. But how they will change in a particular place, we cannot say. This evolves over time. When Buddhism first came from India to countries like Sri Lanka or Tibet, it gradually evolved, and in time a unique tradition arose. This is also happening in the West, and gradually Buddhism may evolve with Western culture.</phrase></para><para><phrase>Of course, what distinguishes the contemporary situation from past transmissions of Buddhism is that almost the entire array of traditions that evolved elsewhere is now accessible to anyone who is interested. And it is in such a context that I welcome this new edition of Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli’s celebrated English translation of the </phrase><emphasis>Path of Purification</emphasis><phrase>. I offer my prayers that readers, wherever they are, may find in it advice and inspiration to develop that inner peace that will contribute to creating a happier and more peaceful world.</phrase></para><para><phrase>May 2000</phrase></para></section><section><title><phrase>Publisher’s Foreword to Third Edition </phrase></title><para><literal>[26|xxiv]</literal><phrase>Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli’s translation of the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga</emphasis><phrase> not only makes available in fluent English this difficult and intricate classical work of Theravāda Buddhism, the high point of the commentarial era, but itself ranks as an outstanding cultural achievement perhaps unmatched by Pali Buddhist scholarship in the twentieth century. This achievement is even more remarkable in that the translator had completed the first draft within his first four years as a bhikkhu, which is also the amount of time he had been a student of Pali.</phrase></para><para><phrase>The Buddhist Publication Society first issued this work beginning in 1975, with the kind consent of the original publisher, Mr. Ānanda Semage of Colombo.

So it was not done with any intention at all of publication; but rather it grew together out of notes made on some of the book’s passages. By the end of 1953 it had been completed, more or less, and put aside. Early in the following year a suggestion to publish it was put to me, and I eventually agreed, though not without a good deal of hesitation. Reasons for agreeing, however, seemed not entirely lacking. The only previous English version of this remarkable work had long been out of print. Justification too could in some degree be founded on the rather different angle from which this version is made.</phrase></para><para><phrase>Over a year was then spent in typing out the manuscript during which time, and since, a good deal of revision has taken place, the intention of the revision being always to propitiate the demon of inaccuracy and at the same time to make the translation perspicuous and the translator inconspicuous. Had publication been delayed, it might well have been more polished. Nevertheless the work of polishing is probably endless. Somewhere a halt must be made.</phrase></para><para><phrase>A guiding principle—the foremost, in fact—has throughout been avoidance of misrepresentation or distortion; for the ideal translation (which has yet to be made) should, like a looking glass, not discolour or blur or warp the original which it reflects. Literalness, however, on the one hand and considerations of clarity and style on the other make irreconcilable claims on a translator, who has to choose and to compromise. Vindication of his choice is sometimes difficult.</phrase></para><para><phrase>I have dealt at the end of the Introduction with some particular problems. Not, however, with all of them or completely; for the space allotted to an introduction is limited.</phrase></para><para><phrase>Much that is circumstantial has now changed since the Buddha discovered and made known his liberating doctrine 2,500 years ago, and likewise since this work was composed some nine centuries later. On the other hand, the Truth he discovered has remained untouched by all that circumstantial change. Old cosmologies give place to new; but the questions of consciousness, of pain and death, of responsibility for acts, and of what should be looked to in the scale it values as the highest of all, remain. Reasons for the perennial freshness of the Buddha’s teaching—of his handling of these questions—are several, but not least among them is its independence of any particular cosmology. Established as it is for its foundation on the self-evident insecurity of the human situation (the truth of suffering), the structure of the Four Noble Truths provides an unfailing standard of value, unique in its simplicity, its completeness and its ethical purity, by means of which any situation can be assessed and a profitable choice made.</phrase></para><para><phrase>Now I should like to make acknowledgements, as follows, to all those without whose help this translation would never have been begun, persisted with or completed. </phrase><literal>[28|xxvi]</literal><phrase>To the venerable Ñāṇatiloka Mahāthera (from whom I first learned Pali) for his most kind consent to check the draft manuscript. However, although he had actually read through the first two chapters, a long spell of illness unfortunately prevented him from continuing with this himself.</phrase></para><para><phrase>To the venerable Soma Thera for his unfailing assistance both in helping me to gain familiarity with the often difficult Pali idiom of the Commentaries and to get something of the feel—as it were, “from inside”—of Pali literature against its Indian background. Failing that, no translation would ever have been made: I cannot tell how far I have been able to express any of it in the rendering.</phrase></para><para><phrase>To the venerable Nyanaponika Thera, German pupil of the venerable Ñāṇatiloka Mahāthera, for very kindly undertaking to check the whole manuscript in detail with the venerable Ñāṇatiloka Mahāthera’s German translation (I knowing no German).</phrase></para><para><phrase>To all those with whom I have had discussions on the Dhamma, which have been many and have contributed to the clearing up of not a few unclear points.</phrase></para><para><phrase>Lastly, and what is mentioned last bears its own special emphasis, it has been an act of singular merit on the part of Mr. A.

The early or classical period, which may be called the First Period, begins with the Tipiṭaka itself in the 6th century BCE and ends with the </phrase><emphasis>Milindapañhā </emphasis><phrase>about five centuries later. These works, composed in India, were brought to Sri Lanka, where they were maintained in Pali but written about in Sinhalese. By the first century CE, Sanskrit (independently of the rise of Mahayana) or a vernacular had probably quite displaced Pali as the medium of study in all the Buddhist “schools” on the Indian mainland. Literary activity in Sri Lanka declined and, it seems, fell into virtual abeyance between CE 150 and 350, as will appear below. The first Pali renascence was under way in Sri Lanka and South India by about 400 and was made viable by Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa. This can be called the Middle Period. Many of its principal figures were Indian. It developed in several centres in the South Indian mainland and spread to Burma, and it can be said to have lasted till about the 12th century. Meanwhile the renewed literary activity again declined in Sri Lanka till it was eclipsed by the disastrous invasion of Magha in the 11th</phrase><emphasis role="bold"> </emphasis><phrase>century. The second renascence, or the Third Period as it may be termed, begins in the</phrase><emphasis role="bold"> </emphasis><phrase>following century with Sri Lanka’s recovery, coinciding more or less with major political changes in Burma. In Sri Lanka it lasted for several centuries and in Burma for much longer, though India about that time or soon after lost all forms of Buddhism. But this period does not concern the present purpose and is only sketched in for the sake of perspective.</phrase></para><para><phrase>The recorded facts relating from the standpoint of Sri Lanka to the rise of the Middle Period are very few, and it is worthwhile tabling them.</phrase><footnote><para><phrase>Exact dates are not agreed. The </phrase><emphasis>Sri Lanka Chronicles</emphasis><phrase> give the lengths of reigns of kings of Sri Lanka back to the time of the Buddha and also of kings of Magadha from Asoka back to the same time. Calculated backwards the list gives 543 BCE as the year of the Buddha’s parinibbāna (see list of kings in Codrington’s </phrase><emphasis>Short History of Ceylon</emphasis><phrase>, Macmillan 1947, p. xvi.). For adjustments to this calculation that bring the date of the parinibbāna forward to 483 BCE (the date most generally accepted in Europe), see e.g. Geiger, </phrase><emphasis>Mahāvaṃsa</emphasis><phrase> translation (introduction) </phrase><emphasis>Epigraphia Zeylanica </emphasis><phrase>I, 156; E. J. Thomas, </phrase><emphasis>Life of the Buddha</emphasis><phrase>, Kegan Paul, p. 26, n.1. It seems certain, however, that Mahānāma was reigning in the year 428 because of a letter sent by him to the Chinese court (Codrington p. 29; E.Z. III, 12). If the adjusted date is accepted then 60 extra years have somehow to be squeezed out without displacing Mahānāma’s reign.

The violent upsets in his reign followed by his founding of the Abhayagiri Monastery, its secession and schism, changed the whole situation at home. Sensing insecurity, the Great Monastery took the precaution to commit the Tipiṭaka for the first time to writing, doing so in the provinces away from the king’s presence. Now by about the end of the first century BCE (dates are very vague), with Sanskrit Buddhist literature just launching out upon its long era of magnificence, Sanskrit was on its way to become a language of international culture. In Sri Lanka the Great Monastery, already committed by tradition to strict orthodoxy based on Pali, had been confirmed in that attitude by the schism of its rival, which now began publicly to study the new ideas from India. In the first century BCE probably the influx of Sanskrit thought was still quite small, so that the Great Monastery could well maintain its name in Anurādhapura as the principal centre of learning by developing its ancient Tipiṭaka commentaries in Sinhalese. This might account for the shift of emphasis from practice to scholarship in King Vaṭṭagāmani’s reign. Evidence shows great activity in this latter field throughout the first century BCE, and all this material was doubtless written down too.</phrase></para><para><phrase>In the first century CE, Sanskrit Buddhism (“Hīnayāna,” and perhaps by then Mahāyāna) was growing rapidly and spreading abroad. The Abhayagiri Monastery would naturally have been busy studying and advocating some of these weighty </phrase><literal>[33|xxxi]</literal><phrase>developments while the Great Monastery had nothing new to offer: the rival was thus able, at some risk, to appear go-ahead and up-to-date while the old institution perhaps began to fall behind for want of new material, new inspiration and international connections, because its studies being restricted to the orthodox presentation in the Sinhalese language, it had already done what it could in developing Tipiṭaka learning (on the mainland Theravāda was doubtless deeper in the same predicament). Anyway we find that from the first century onwards its constructive scholarship dries up, and instead, with the reign of King Bhātika Abhaya (BCE 20–CE 9), public wrangles begin to break out between the two monasteries. This scene indeed drags on, gradually worsening through the next three centuries, almost bare as they are of illuminating information. King Vasabha’s reign (CE 66–110) seems to be the last mentioned in the Commentaries as we have them now, from which it may be assumed that soon afterwards they were closed (or no longer kept up), nothing further being added. Perhaps the Great Monastery, now living only on its past, was itself getting infected with heresies. But without speculating on the immediate reasons that induced it to let its chain of teachers lapse and to cease adding to its body of Sinhalese learning, it is enough to note that the situation went on deteriorating, further complicated by intrigues, till in Mahāsena’s reign (CE 277–304) things came to a head.</phrase></para><para><phrase>With the persecution of the Great Monastery given royal assent and the expulsion of its bhikkhus from the capital, the Abhayagiri Monastery enjoyed nine years of triumph. But the ancient institution rallied its supporters in the southern provinces and the king repented. The bhikkhus returned and the king restored the buildings, which had been stripped to adorn the rival. Still, the Great Monastery must have foreseen, after this affair, that unless it could successfully compete with Sanskrit it had small hope of holding its position. With that the only course open was to launch a drive for the rehabilitation of Pali—a drive to bring the study of that language up to a standard fit to compete with the “modern” Sanskrit in the field of international Buddhist culture: by cultivating Pali at home and abroad it could assure its position at home. It was a revolutionary project, involving the displacement of Sinhalese by Pali as the language for the study and discussion of Buddhist teachings, and the founding of a school of Pali literary composition. Earlier it would doubtless have been impracticable; but the atmosphere had changed. Though various Sanskrit non-Mahayana sects are well known to have continued to flourish all over India, there is almost nothing to show the status of the Pali language there by now. Only the </phrase><emphasis>Mahāvaṃsa </emphasis><phrase>[XXXVII.215f. quoted below] suggests that the Theravāda sect there had not only put aside but lost perhaps all of its old non-Piṭaka material dating from Asoka’s time.</phrase><footnote><para><phrase>See also </phrase><emphasis>A Record of Buddhist Religion</emphasis><phrase> by I-tsing, translation by J. Takakusu, Claren do Press, 1896, p. xxiii, where a geographical distribution of various schools gives Mūlasarvāstivāda mainly in the north and Ariyasthavira mainly in the south of India. I-tsing, who did not visit Sri Lanka, was in India at the end of the 7th cent.; but he does not mention whether the Ariyasthavira (Theravāda) Nikāya in India pursued its studies in the Pali of its Tipiṭaka or in Sanskrit or in a local vernacular.</phrase></para></footnote><phrase> One may guess that the pattern of things in Sri Lanka only echoed a process that had gone much further in India. But in the </phrase><literal>[34|xxxii]</literal><phrase>island of Sri Lanka the ancient body of learning, much of it pre-Asokan, had been kept lying by, as it were maturing in its two and a half centuries of neglect, and it had now acquired a new and great potential value due to the purity of its pedigree in contrast with the welter of new original thinking. Theravāda centres of learning on the mainland were also doubtless much interested and themselves anxious for help in a repristinization.</phrase><footnote><para><phrase>In the epilogues and prologues of various works between the 5th and 12th centuries there is mention of e.g., Badaratittha (Vism-a prol.: near Chennai), Kañcipura (</phrase><citation>A-a</citation><phrase> epil.: = Conjevaram near Chennai), and other places where different teachers accepting the Great Monastery tradition lived and worked.

A constant supporter of the Community, trusting with unwavering faith in the Three Jewels, belonging to an illustrious family and known by the name of Mahānigamasāmi (Lord of the Great City), had an excellent work-room built there on its southern side accessible to the ever virtuously conducted Community of Bhikkhus. The building was beautifully appointed, agreeably endowed with cool shade and had a lavish water supply. The Vinaya Commentary was begun by me for the sake of the Elder Buddhasiri of pure virtuous behaviour while I was living there in Mahānigamasāmi’s building, and it is now complete. It was begun by me in the twentieth year of the reign of peace of the King Sirinivāsa (Of Glorious Life), the renowned and glorious guardian who has kept the whole of Lanka’s island free from trouble. It was finished in one year without mishap in a world beset by mishaps, so may all beings attain…’’</phrase><emphasis> (</emphasis><phrase><citation>Vin-a</citation><phrase> Epilogue</phrase></phrase><phrase>).</phrase></para><para><phrase>Mostly it is assumed that he wrote and “published” his works one by one as authors do today. The assumption may not be correct. There is an unerring consistency throughout the system of explanation he adopts, and there are cross-references between works. This suggests that while the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga </emphasis><phrase>itself may perhaps have been composed and produced first, the others as they exist now were more likely worked over contemporaneously and all more or less finished before any one of them was given out. They may well have been given out then following the order of the books in the Tipiṭaka which they explain. So in that way it may be taken that the Vinaya Commentary came next to the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga; </emphasis><phrase>then the Commentaries on the four Nikāyas (Collections of Suttas), and after them the Abhidhamma Commentaries. Though it is not said that the Vinaya Commentary was given out first of these, still the prologue and epilogue contain the most information. The four Nikāya Commentaries all have the same basic prologue; but the Saṃyutta Nikāya Commentary inserts in its prologue a stanza referring the reader to “the two previous Collections” (i.e. the Dīgha and Majjhima Nikāyas) for explanations of the names of towns and for illustrative stories, while the Aṅguttara </phrase><literal>[37|xxxv]</literal><phrase>Nikāya Commentary replaces this stanza with another referring to “the Dīgha and Majjhima” by name for the same purpose. The point may seem laboured and even trivial, but it is not irrelevant; for if it is assumed that these works were written and “published” in some historical order of composition, one expects to find some corresponding development of thought and perhaps discovers what one’s assumption has projected upon them. The more likely assumption, based on consideration of the actual contents, is that their form and content was settled before any one of them was given out.</phrase></para><para><phrase>Sometimes it is argued that the commentaries to the Dhammapada and the Jātaka may not be by the same author because the style is different. But that fact could be accounted for by the difference in the subject matter; for these two commentaries consist mainly of popular stories, which play only a very minor role in the other works. Besides, while this author is quite inexorably consistent throughout his works in his explanations of Dhamma, he by no means always maintains that consistency in different versions of the same story in, say, different Nikāya Commentaries (compare for instance, the version of the story of Elder Tissabhūti given in the commentary to </phrase><phrase><citation>A</citation><phrase> 1:2.6</phrase></phrase><phrase>, with that at </phrase><phrase><citation>M-a</citation><phrase> I 66</phrase></phrase><phrase>; also the version of the story of the Elder Mahā Tissa in the </phrase><citation>A-a</citation><phrase>, same ref., with that at </phrase><phrase><citation>M-a</citation><phrase> I 185</phrase></phrase><phrase>). Perhaps less need for strictness was felt with such story material. And there is also another possibility. It may not unreasonably be supposed that he did not work alone, without help, and that he had competent assistants. If so, he might well have delegated the drafting of the Khuddaka Nikāya commentaries—those of the Khuddakapāṭha and Suttanipāta, Dhammapada, and the Jātaka—or part of them, supervising and completing them himself, after which the official “postscript” was appended. This assumption seems not implausible and involves less difficulties than its alternatives.</phrase><footnote><para><phrase>A definite statement that the </phrase><citation>Dhp-a</citation><phrase> was written later by someone else can hardly avoid the inference that the “postscript” was a fraud, or at least misleading.</phrase></para></footnote><phrase>These secondary commentaries may well have been composed after the others.</phrase></para><para><phrase>The full early history of the Pali Tipiṭaka and its commentaries in Sinhalese is given in the Sri Lanka Chronicle, the </phrase><emphasis>Dīpavaṃsa, </emphasis><phrase>and </phrase><emphasis>Mahāvaṃsa, </emphasis><phrase>and also in the introduction to the Vinaya Commentary. In the prologue to each of the four Nikāya Commentaries it is conveniently summarized by Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa himself as follows: “[I shall now take] the commentary, whose object is to clarify the meaning of the subtle and most excellent Long Collection (Dīgha Nikāya) … set forth in detail by the Buddha and by his like [i.e. the Elder Sāriputta and other expounders of discourses in the Sutta Piṭaka]—the commentary that in the beginning was chanted [at the First Council] and later re-chanted [at the Second and Third], and was brought to the Sīhala Island (Sri Lanka) by the Arahant Mahinda the Great and rendered into the Sīhala tongue for the benefit of the islanders—and from that commentary I shall remove the Sīhala tongue, replacing it by the graceful language that conforms with Scripture and is purified and free from flaws. Not diverging from the standpoint of the elders residing in the Great Monastery [in Anurādhapura], who illumine the elders’ heritage and are all well </phrase><literal>[38|xxxvi]</literal><phrase>versed in exposition, and rejecting subject matter needlessly repeated, I shall make the meaning clear for the purpose of bringing contentment to good people and contributing to the long endurance of the Dhamma.”</phrase></para><para><phrase>There are references in these works to “the Ancients” </phrase><emphasis>(porāṇā) </emphasis><phrase>or “Former Teachers” </phrase><emphasis>(pubbācariyā) </emphasis><phrase>as well as to a number of Sinhalese commentaries additional to the three referred to in the quotation given earlier. The fact is plain enough that a complete body of commentary had been built up during the nine centuries or so that separate Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa from the Buddha. A good proportion of it dated no doubt from the actual time of the Buddha himself, and this core had been added to in India (probably in Pali), and later by learned elders in Sri Lanka (in Sinhalese) as references to their pronouncements show (e.g. </phrase><link linkend="XII.105">XII.105</link><phrase> and </phrase><link linkend="XII.117">117</link><phrase>).</phrase></para><para><phrase>This body of material—one may guess that its volume was enormous—Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa set himself to edit and render into Pali (the Tipiṭaka itself had been left in the original Pali). For this he had approval and express invitation (see, e.g., the epilogue to the present work, which the Elder Saṅghapāla invited him to compose). Modern critics have reproached him with lack of originality: but if we are to judge by his declared aims, originality, or to use his own phrase “advertising his own standpoint” (</phrase><link linkend="XVII.25">XVII.25</link><phrase>), seems likely to have been one of the things he would have wished to avoid. He says, for instance, “I shall expound the comforting </phrase><emphasis>Path of Purification, </emphasis><phrase>pure in expositions, relying on the teaching of the dwellers in the Great Monastery” (</phrase><link linkend="I.4">I.4</link><phrase>; see also epilogue), and again “Now, as to the entire trustworthiness </phrase><emphasis>(samantapāsādikatta) </emphasis><phrase>of this </phrase><emphasis>Samantapāsādika</emphasis><phrase>: the wise see nothing untrustworthy here when they look—in the chain of teachers, in the citations of circumstance, instance and category [in each case], in the avoidance of others’ standpoints, in the purity of [our] own standpoint, in the correctness of details, in the word-meanings, in the order of construing the text, in the exposition of the training precepts, in the use of classification by the analytical method—which is why this detailed commentary on the Vinaya … is called </phrase><emphasis>Samantapāsādika </emphasis><phrase>(</phrase><citation>Vin-a</citation><phrase> epilogue). And then: “The commentary on the Pātimokkha, which I began at the request of the Elder Soṇa for the purpose of removing doubts in those uncertain of the Vinaya, and which covers the whole Sinhalese commentarial system based upon the arrangement adopted by the dwellers in the Great Monastery, is finished. The whole essence of the commentary and the entire meaning of the text has been extracted and there is no sentence here that might conflict with the text or with the commentaries of the dwellers in the Great Monastery or those of the Ancients” (Pātimokkha Commentary epilogue). Such examples could be multiplied (see especially also </phrase><link linkend="XVII.25">XVII.25</link><phrase>).</phrase></para><para><phrase>There is only one instance in the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga </emphasis><phrase>where he openly advances an opinion of his own, with the words “our preference here is this” (</phrase><link linkend="XIII.123">XIII.123</link><phrase>). He does so once in the Majjhima Nikāya Commentary, too, saying “the point is not dealt with by the Ancients, but this is my opinion” (</phrase><phrase><citation>M-a</citation><phrase> I 28</phrase></phrase><phrase>). The rarity of such instances and the caution expressed in them imply that he himself was disinclined to speculate and felt the need to point the fact out when he did. He actually says “one’s own opinion is the weakest authority of all and should only be accepted if it accords with the Suttas” (</phrase><phrase><citation>D-a</citation><phrase> 567–568</phrase></phrase><phrase>). So it is likely that </phrase><literal>[39|xxxvii]</literal><phrase>he regarded what we should call original thinking as the province of the Buddha, and his own task as the fortification of that thought by coordinating the explanations of it. However, not every detail that he edited can claim direct support in the Suttas.</phrase></para><para><phrase>The following considerations lend some support to the assumptions just made. It has been pointed out</phrase><footnote><para><phrase>Adikaram, </phrase><emphasis>Early History of Buddhism in Ceylon</emphasis><phrase>, pp. 3 and 86.</phrase></para></footnote><phrase>that in describing in the Vinaya Commentary how the tradition had been “maintained up to the present day by the chain of teachers and pupils” (</phrase><phrase><citation>Vin-a</citation><phrase> 61–62</phrase></phrase><phrase>) the list of teachers’ names that follows contains names only traceable down to about the middle of the 2</phrase><phrase>nd</phrase><phrase> century CE, but not later. Again, there appear in his works numbers of illustrative stories, all of which are set either in India or Sri Lanka. However, no single one of them can be pointed to as contemporary. Stories about India in every case where a date can be assigned are not later than Asoka (3</phrase><phrase>rd</phrase><phrase> cent. BCE). Many stories about Sri Lanka cannot be dated, but of those that can none seems later than the 2</phrase><phrase>nd</phrase><phrase> century CE. This suggests that the material which he had before him to edit and translate had been already completed and fixed more than two centuries earlier in Sri Lanka, and that the words “present day” were not used by him to refer to his own time, but were already in the material he was coordinating. This final fixing, if it is a fact, might have been the aftermath of the decision taken in Sri Lanka in the first century BCE to commit the Pali Tipiṭaka to writing.</phrase></para><para><phrase>Something now needs to be said about the relation of the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga </emphasis><phrase>to the other books. This author’s work is characterized by relentless accuracy, consistency, and fluency of erudition, and much dominated by formalism. Not only is this formalism evident in the elaborate pattern of the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga </emphasis><phrase>but also that work’s relationship to the others is governed by it. The </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga </emphasis><phrase>itself extracts from the Tipiṭaka all the central doctrines that pivot upon the Four Noble Truths, presenting them as a coherent systematic whole by way of quotation and explanation interspersed with treatises on subjects of more or less relative importance, all being welded into an intricate edifice. The work can thus stand alone. But the aim of the commentaries to the four main Nikāyas or Collections of Suttas is to explain the subject matter of individual discourses and, as well, certain topics and special doctrines not dealt with in the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga </emphasis><phrase>(many passages commenting on identical material in the Suttas in different Nikāyas are reproduced </phrase><emphasis>verbatim </emphasis><phrase>in each commentary, and elsewhere, e.g., MN 10, cf. DN 22, Satipaṭṭhāna Vibhaṅga, etc., etc., and respective commentaries). But these commentaries always refer the reader to the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga </emphasis><phrase>for explanations of the central doctrines. And though the Vinaya and Abhidhamma (commentaries are less closely bound to the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga, </emphasis><phrase>still they too either refer the reader to it or reproduce large blocks of it. The author himself says: “The treatises on virtue and on the ascetic’s rules, all the meditation subjects, the details of the attainments of the jhānas, together with the directions for each temperament, all the various kinds of direct-knowledge, the exposition of the definition of understanding, the aggregates, elements, bases, and faculties, the Four Noble Truths, the explanation </phrase><literal>[40|xxxviii]</literal><phrase>of the structure of conditions (dependent origination), and lastly the development of insight, by methods that are purified and sure and not divergent from Scripture—since these things have already been quite clearly stated in the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga </emphasis><phrase>I shall no more dwell upon them here; for the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga </emphasis><phrase>stands between and in the midst of all four Collections (Nikāyas) and will clarify the meaning of such things stated therein. It was made in that way: take it therefore along with this same commentary and know the meaning of the Long Collection (Dīgha Nikāya)” (prologue to the four Nikāyas).</phrase></para><para><phrase>This is all that can, without unsafe inferences, be gleaned of Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa himself from his own works (but see below). Now, there is the </phrase><emphasis>Mahāvaṃsa </emphasis><phrase>account. The composition of the second part (often called </phrase><emphasis>Cūḷavaṃsa) </emphasis><phrase>of that historical poem is attributed to an Elder Dhammakitti, who lived in or about the thirteenth century. Here is a translation of the relevant passage:</phrase></para><para><phrase>“There was a Brahman student who was born near the site of the Enlightenment Tree. He was acquainted with the arts and accomplishments of the sciences and was qualified in the Vedas. He was well versed in what he knew and unhesitant over any phrase. Being interested in doctrines, he wandered over Jambudīpa (India) engaging in disputation.</phrase></para><para><phrase>“He came to a certain monastery, and there in the night he recited Pātañjali’s system with each phrase complete and well rounded. The senior elder there, Revata by name, recognized, ‘This is a being of great understanding who ought to be tamed.’ He said, ‘Who is that braying the ass’s bray?’ The other asked, ‘What, then, do you know the meaning of the ass’s bray?’ The elder answered, ‘I know it,’ and he then not only expounded it himself, but explained each statement in the proper way and also pointed out contradictions. The other then urged him, ‘Now expound your own doctrine,’ and the elder repeated a text from the Abhidhamma, but the visitor could not solve its meaning. He asked, ‘Whose system is this?’ and the elder replied, ‘It is the Enlightened One’s system.’ ‘Give it to me,’ he said, but the elder answered, ‘You will have to take the going forth into homelessness.’ So he took the going forth, since he was interested in the system, and he learned the three Piṭakas, after which he believed, ‘This is the only way’ (</phrase><phrase><citation>M</citation><phrase> I 55</phrase></phrase><phrase>). Because his speech </phrase><emphasis>(ghosa) </emphasis><phrase>was profound (voice was deep) like that of the Enlightened One </phrase><emphasis>(Buddha) </emphasis><phrase>they called him Buddhaghosa, so that like the Enlightened One he might be voiced over the surface of the earth.</phrase></para><para><phrase>“He prepared a treatise there called </phrase><emphasis>Ñāṇodaya, </emphasis><phrase>and then the </phrase><emphasis>Atthasālinī, </emphasis><phrase>a commentary on the Dhammasaṅgaṇī.

See </phrase><phrase><citation>M-a</citation><phrase> IV 114</phrase></phrase><phrase>.</phrase></para></footnote><phrase> When the Elder Revata saw that, he said, ‘Here only the text has been preserved. There is no commentary here, and likewise no Teachers’ Doctrine; for that has been allowed to go to pieces and is no longer known. However, a Sinhalese commentary still exists, which is pure. It was rendered into the Sinhalese tongue by the learned Mahinda with proper regard for the</phrase><literal>[41|xxxix]</literal><phrase> way of commenting that was handed down by the three Councils as taught by the Enlightened One and inculcated by Sāriputta and others. Go there, and after you have learnt it translate it into the language of the Magadhans. That will bring benefit to the whole world.’ As soon as this was said, he made up his mind to set out.</phrase></para><para><emphasis>“</emphasis><phrase>He came from there to this island in the reign of this king (Mahānāma). He came to the (Great Monastery, the monastery of all true men.

In order to demonstrate his skill to the multitude deities hid the book, and he was obliged to prepare it a second time, and again a third time. When the book was brought for the third time to be read out, the gods replaced the other two copies with it. Then the bhikkhus read out the three copies together, and it was found that there was no difference between the three in either the chapters or the meaning or the order of the material or the phrases and syllables of the Theravāda texts. With that the Community applauded in high delight and again and again it was said, ‘Surely this is (the Bodhisatta) Metteyya.’ “They gave him the books of the three Piṭakas together with the Commentary. Then, while staying undisturbed in the Library Monastery, he translated the Sinhalese Commentary into the Magadhan language, the root-speech of all, by which he brought benefit to beings of all tongues. The teachers of the Elders’ Tradition accepted it as equal in authority with the texts themselves. Then, when the tasks to be done were finished, he went back to Jambudīpa to pay homage to the Great Enlightenment Tree.</phrase></para><para><emphasis>“</emphasis><phrase>And when Mahānāma had enjoyed twenty-two years’ reign upon earth and had performed a variety of meritorious works, he passed on according to his deeds”—(</phrase><phrase><citation>Mhv</citation><phrase> XXXVII.215–47</phrase></phrase><phrase>).</phrase></para><para><phrase>King Mahānāma is identified with the “King Sirinivāsa” and the “King Sirikuḍḍa” mentioned respectively in the epilogues to the Vinaya and Dhammapada Commentaries.

The Sri Lankan Chronicles survived the historical criticism to which they were subjected in the last hundred years. The independent evidence that could be brought to bear supported them, and Western scholars ended by pronouncing them reliable in essentials. The account just quoted is considered to be based on historical fact even if it contains legendary matter.</phrase></para><para><phrase>It is not possible to make use of the body of Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa’s works to test the </phrase><emphasis>Mahāvaṃsa’s</emphasis><phrase> claim that he was a learned Brahman from central India, and so on. It has been shown already how the presumption is always, where the contrary is not explicitly stated, that he is editing and translating material placed before him rather than displaying his own private knowledge, experience and opinions. And so it would be a critical mistake to use any such passage in his work for assessing his personal traits; for in them it is, pretty certainly, not him we are dealing with at all but people who lived three or more centuries earlier. Those passages probably tell us merely that he was a scrupulously accurate and conscientious editor. His geographical descriptions are translations, not eyewitness accounts. Then such a sutta passage as that commented on in </phrase><link linkend="I.86">Chapter I, 86</link><phrase>–</phrase><link linkend="I.97">97</link><phrase> of the present work, which is a part of a sutta used by bhikkhus for daily reflection on the four requisites of the life of a bhikkhu, is certain to have been fully commented on from the earliest times, so that it would be just such a critical mistake to infer from this comment anything about his abilities as an original commentator, or anything else of a personal nature about him or his own past experience.</phrase><footnote><para><phrase>For instance, Prof. Kosambi, in his preface to the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga</emphasis><phrase>, Harvard ed., overlooks these considerations when he says: “More positive evidence (that he was not a North-Indian Brahman) is in the passage </phrase><emphasis>’Uṇhassa ti aggisantāpassa. Tassa vanadāhādisu sambhavo veditabbo’ </emphasis><phrase>(</phrase><link linkend="I.86">I.86</link><phrase>). ’Heat: the heat of fire, such as occurs at the time of forest fires, etc.’” This is a comment upon protection against heat given by a </phrase><emphasis>cīvara</emphasis><phrase>. His explanation is obviously ridiculous: “It is not known to Indian southerners that a bare skin is sure to be sunburnt in the northern summer” (p. xii). And Professor Kosambi has not only overlooked the fact that it is almost certainly translated material that he is criticizing as original composition, but he appears not to have even read the whole passage. The sutta sentence (</phrase><phrase><citation>M</citation><phrase> I 10</phrase></phrase><phrase>) commented on in the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga </emphasis><phrase>(</phrase><link linkend="I.86">I.86</link><phrase>-</phrase><link linkend="I.87">87</link><phrase>) contains two words </phrase><emphasis>uṇha </emphasis><phrase>and </phrase><emphasis>ātapa. </emphasis><phrase>If, before condemning the explanation as “ridiculous,” he had read on, he would have found, a line or two below, the words </phrase><emphasis>Ātapo ti suriyātapo </emphasis><phrase>(“‘Burning’ is burning of the sun”—</phrase><link linkend="I.87">I.87</link><phrase>).</phrase></para></footnote><phrase>And again, the controversial subject of the origin of the Brahman caste (see </phrase><phrase><citation>M-a</citation><phrase> II 418</phrase></phrase><phrase>) must have been fully explained from the Buddhist standpoint from the very start. If then that account disagrees with Brahmanical lore—and it would be odd, all things considered, if it did not—there is no justification for concluding on those grounds that the author of the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga</emphasis><phrase> was not of Brahman origin and that the </phrase><emphasis>Mahāvaṃsa</emphasis><phrase> is wrong. What does indeed seem improbable is that the authorities of the Great Monastery, resolutely committed to oppose unorthodoxy, would have given him a free hand to “correct” their traditions to accord with Brahmanical texts or with other alien sources, even if he had so wished. Again, the fact that there are allusions to extraneous, non-Buddhist literature (e.g. </phrase><link linkend="VII.58">VII.58</link><phrase>; </phrase><link linkend="XVI.4n2">XVI.4 n.2</link><phrase>; </phrase><link linkend="XVI.85">XVI.85</link><phrase>, etc.) hardly affects this issue because they too can have been already in the </phrase><literal>[43|xli]</literal><phrase>material he was editing or supplied to him by the elders with whom he was working. What might repay careful study are perhaps those things, such as certain Mahayana teachings and names, as well as much Brahmanical philosophy, which he ignores though he must have known about them. This ignoring cannot safely be ascribed to ignorance unless we are sure it was not dictated by policy; and we are not sure at all. His silences (in contrast to the author of the </phrase><emphasis>Paramatthamañjūsā</emphasis><phrase>) are sometimes notable in this respect.</phrase></para><para><phrase>The “popular novel” called </phrase><emphasis>Buddhaghosuppatti</emphasis><phrase>, which was composed in Burma by an elder called Mahāmaṅgala, perhaps as early as the 15th century, is less dependable. But a survey without some account of it would be incomplete. So here is a </phrase><emphasis>précis</emphasis><phrase>:</phrase></para><para><phrase>Near the Bodhi Tree at Gayā there was a town called Ghosa. Its ruler had a Brahman chaplain called Kesi married to a wife called Kesinī. An elder bhikkhu, who was a friend of Kesi, used to wonder, when the Buddha’s teaching was recited in Sinhalese, and people did not therefore understand it, who would be able to translate it into Magadhan (Pāḷi). He saw that there was the son of a deity living in the Tāvatiṃsa heaven, whose name was Ghosa and who was capable of doing it. This deity was persuaded to be reborn in the human world as the son of the Brahman Kesi. He learnt the Vedas. One day he sat down in a place sacred to Vishnu and ate peas. Brahmans angrily rebuked him, but he uttered a stanza, “The pea itself is Vishnu; who is there called Vishnu? And how shall I know which is Vishnu?” and no one could answer him. Then one day while Kesi was instructing the town’s ruler in the Vedas a certain passage puzzled him, but Ghosa wrote down the explanations on a palm leaf, which was found later by his father—(Chapter I).</phrase></para><para><phrase>Once when the elder bhikkhu was invited to Kesi’s house for a meal Ghosa’s mat was given to him to sit on. Ghosa was furious and abused the elder. Then he asked him if he knew the Vedas and any other system. The elder gave a recitation from the Vedas. Then Ghosa asked him for his own system, whereupon the elder expounded the first triad of the Abhidhamma schedule, on profitable, unprofitable, and indeterminate thought-arisings. Ghosa asked whose the system was. He was told that it was the Buddha’s and that it could only be learnt after becoming a bhikkhu. He accordingly went forth into homelessness as a bhikkhu, and in one month he learned the three Piṭakas. After receiving the full admission he acquired the four discriminations. The name given to him was Buddhaghosa—(Chapter II).</phrase></para><para><phrase>One day the question arose in his mind: “Who has more understanding of the Buddha-word, I or my preceptor?” His preceptor, whose cankers were exhausted, read the thought in his mind and rebuked him, telling him to ask his forgiveness. The pupil was then very afraid, and after asking for forgiveness, he was told that in order to make amends he must go to Sri Lanka and translate the Buddha-word (</phrase><emphasis>sic</emphasis><phrase>) from Sinhalese into Magadhan. He agreed, but asked that he might first be allowed to convert his father from the Brahman religion to the Buddha’s teaching. In order to achieve this he had a brick apartment fitted with locks and furnished with food and water. He set a contrivance so that when his father went inside he was trapped. He then preached to his father on the virtues of the Buddha, and on the pains of hell resulting from wrong belief. After three days his father was converted, and he took the Three Refuges. The son then opened the door and made </phrase><literal>[44|xlii]</literal><phrase>opened the door and made amends to his father with flowers and such things for the offence done to him. Kesi became a stream-enterer—(Chapter III).</phrase></para><para><phrase>This done, he set sail in a ship for Sri Lanka. The Mahāthera Buddhadatta</phrase><footnote><para><phrase>The allusion is to the author of various Pali works including the </phrase><emphasis>Abhidhammāvatāra; </emphasis><phrase>see n. 4.</phrase></para></footnote><phrase> had set sail that day from Sri Lanka for India. The two ships met by the intervention of Sakka Ruler of Gods. When the two elders saw each other, the Elder Buddhaghosa told the other: “The Buddha’s Dispensation has been put into Sinhalese; I shall go and translate it and put it into Magadhan.” The other said, “I was sent to go and translate the Buddha-word and write it in Magadhan. I have only done the </phrase><emphasis>Jinālaṅkāra</emphasis><phrase>, the </phrase><emphasis>Dantavaṃsa</emphasis><phrase>, the </phrase><emphasis>Dhātuvaṃsa</emphasis><phrase> and the </phrase><emphasis>Bodhivaṃsa</emphasis><phrase>, not the commentaries and the sub-commentaries (</phrase><emphasis>ṭīkā</emphasis><phrase>). If you, sir, are translating the Dispensation from Sinhalese into Magadhan, do the commentaries to the Three Piṭakas.” Then praising the Elder Buddhaghosa, he gave him the gall-nut, the iron stylus, and the stone given him by Sakka Ruler of Gods, adding, “If you have eye trouble or backache, rub the gall-nut on the stone and wet the place that hurts; then your ailment will vanish.” Then he recited a stanza from his </phrase><emphasis>Jinālaṅkāra. </emphasis><phrase>The other said, “Venerable sir, your book is written in very ornate style.

But I have little time before me and shall not live long. So I cannot do it. Do it therefore yourself, and do it well.” Then the two ships separated.

While there he saw one woman water-carrier accidentally break another’s jar, which led to a violent quarrel between them with foul abuse. Knowing that he might be called as a witness, he wrote down what they said in a book. When the case came before the king, the elder was cited as a witness.

The king then asked to see him—(Chapter V).</phrase></para><para><phrase>After this the elder went to pay homage to the Saṅgharāja,</phrase><footnote><para><emphasis>Saṅgharāja </emphasis><phrase>(“Ruler of the Community”—a title existing in Thailand today): possibly a mistake for Saṅghapāla here (see Vis. epil.).</phrase></para></footnote><phrase>the senior elder of Sri Lanka. One day while the senior elder was teaching bhikkhus he came upon a difficult point of Abhidhamma that he could not explain. The Elder Buddhaghosa knew its meaning and wrote it on a board after the senior elder had left. Next day it was discovered and then the senior elder suggested that he should teach the Order of Bhikkhus. The reply was: “I have come to translate the Buddha’s Dispensation into Magadhan.” The senior elder told him, “If so, then construe the Three Piṭakas upon the text beginning, ‘When a wise man, established well in virtue…’” He began the work that day, the stars being favourable, and wrote very quickly. When finished, he put it aside and went to sleep. Meanwhile Sakka, Ruler of Gods, abstracted the book. The elder awoke, and missing it, he wrote another copy very fast by lamplight then he put it aside and slept. Sakka abstracted that </phrase><literal>[45|xliii]</literal><phrase>too. The elder awoke, and not seeing his book, he wrote a third copy very fast by lamplight and wrapped it in his robe. Then he slept again. While he was asleep Sakka put the other two books beside him, and when he awoke he found all three copies. He took them to the senior elder and told him what had happened. When they were read over there was no difference even in a single letter. Thereupon the senior elder gave permission for the translating of the Buddha’s Dispensation. From then on the elder was known to the people of Sri Lanka by the name of Buddhaghosa—(Chapter VI).</phrase></para><para><phrase>He was given apartments in the Brazen Palace, of whose seven floors he occupied the lowest. He observed the ascetic practices and was expert in all the scriptures. It was during his stay there that he translated the Buddha’s Dispensation. When on his alms round he saw fallen palm leaves he would pick them up; this was a duty undertaken by him. One day a man who had climbed a palm tree saw him. He left some palm leaves on the ground, watched him pick them up, and then followed him. Afterwards he brought him a gift of food. The elder concluded his writing of the Dispensation in three months. When the rainy season was over and he had completed the Pavāraṇā ceremony, he consigned the books to the senior elder, the Saṅgharāja. Then the Elder Buddhaghosa had the books written by Elder Mahinda piled up and burnt near the Great Shrine; the pile was as high as seven elephants. Now that this work was done, and wanting to see his parents, he took his leave before going back to India. Before he left, however, his knowledge of Sanskrit was queried by bhikkhus; but he silenced this by delivering a sermon in the language by the Great Shrine. Then he departed—(Chapter VII).</phrase></para><para><phrase>On his return he went to his preceptor and cleared himself of his penance. His parents too forgave him his offences; and when they died they were reborn in the Tusita heaven. He himself, knowing that he would not live much longer, paid homage to his preceptor and went to the Great Enlightenment Tree. Foreseeing his approaching death, he considered thus: “There are three kinds of death: death as cutting off, momentary death, and conventional death. Death as cutting off belongs to those whose cankers are exhausted (and are Arahants). Momentary death is that of each consciousness of the cognitive series beginning with life-continuum consciousness, which arise each immediately on the cessation of the one preceding. Conventional death is that of all (so-called) living beings.</phrase><footnote><para><phrase>A learned allusion to </phrase><link linkend="VIII.1">VIII.1</link><phrase>.</phrase></para></footnote><phrase>Mine will be conventional death.” After his death he was reborn in the Tusita heaven in a golden mansion seven leagues broad surrounded with divine nymphs.

And why did his work become famous beyond its shores? Trends such as have been outlined, working not quite parallel on the Theravāda of India and Sri Lanka, had evolved a situation favouring a rehabilitation of Pali, and consequently the question was already one of interest not only to Sri Lanka, where the old material was preserved. Again the author possessed outstandingly just those personal qualities most fitted to the need—accuracy, an indefatigable mental orderliness, and insight able to crystallize the vast, unwieldy, accumulated exegesis of the Tipiṭaka into a coherent workable whole with a dignified vigorous style, respect for authenticity and dislike of speculation, and (in the circumstances not at all paradoxically) preference for self-effacement. The impetus given by him to Pali scholarship left an indelible mark on the centuries that followed, enabling it to survive from then on the Sanskrit siege as well as the continuing schism and the political difficulties and disasters that harassed Sri Lanka before the “Second Renascence.” A long epoch of culture stems from him. His successors in the Great Monastery tradition continued to write in various centres in South India till the 12</phrase><phrase>th</phrase><phrase> century or so, while his own works spread to Burma and beyond.

Proportionately much less space is devoted to understanding, and there are no stories. Though the appearance in both books of numbers of nearly identical passages suggests that they both drew a good deal from the same sources, the general style differs widely. The four measureless states and the four immaterial states are handled differently in the two books. Besides the “material octads,” “enneads” and “decads,” it mentions “endecads,” etc., too. Its description of the thirteen ascetic practices is quite different. Also Abhidhamma, which is the keystone of Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa’s exegesis, is not used at all in the </phrase><emphasis>Vimuttimagga </emphasis><phrase>(aggregates, truths, etc., do not </phrase><emphasis>in themselves </emphasis><phrase>constitute Abhidhamma in the sense of that Piṭaka). There is for instance even in its description of the consciousness aggregate, no reference to the Dhammasaṅgaṇī’s classification of 89 types, and nothing from the Paṭṭhāna; and though the cognitive series is stated once in its full form (in Ch. 11) no use is made of it to explain conscious workings.

That it contains some minor points accepted by the Abhayagiri Monastery does not necessarily imply that it had any special connections with that centre. The source may have been common to both.

Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa himself never mentions it.</phrase></para></section><section><title><phrase>Trends in the Development of Theravāda doctrine</phrase></title><para><phrase>The doctrines (Dhamma) of the Theravāda Pali tradition can be conveniently traced in three main layers. (1) The first of these contains the main books of the Pali Sutta Piṭakas. (2) The second is the Abhidhamma Piṭaka, notably the closely related books, the Dhammasaṅgaṇī, Vibhaṅga, Paṭṭhāna. (3) The third is the system which the author of the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga </emphasis><phrase>completed, or found completed, and which he set himself to edit and translate back into Pali (some further minor developments took place subsequently, particularly with the 12th century (?) </phrase><emphasis>Abhidhammatthasaṅgaha, </emphasis><phrase>but they are outside the present scope). The point at issue here is not the much-debated historical question of how far the Abhidhamma books (leaving aside the Kathāvatthu) were contemporary with the Vinaya and Suttas, but rather what discernible direction they show in evolution of thought.</phrase></para><para><phrase>(1) The Suttas being taken as the original exposition of the Buddha’s teaching, (2) the Abhidhamma Piṭaka itself appears as a highly technical and specialized systematization, or complementary set of modifications built </phrase><literal>[48|xlvi]</literal><phrase>upon that. Its immediate purpose is, one may say, to describe and pin-point mental constituents and characteristics and relate them to their material basis and to each other (with the secondary object, perhaps, of providing an efficient defence in disputes with heretics and exponents of outsiders’ doctrines). Its ultimate purpose is to furnish additional techniques for getting rid of unjustified assumptions that favour clinging and so obstruct the attainment of the extinction of clinging. Various instruments have been forged in it for sorting and re-sorting experience expressed as </phrase><emphasis>dhammas </emphasis><phrase>(see </phrase><link linkend="VII.n1">Ch. VII, n.1</link><phrase>). These instruments are new to the Suttas, though partly traceable to them. The principal instruments peculiar to it are three: (a) the strict treatment of experience (or the knowable and knowledge, using the words in their widest possible sense) in terms of momentary cognizable states </phrase><emphasis>(dhamma) </emphasis><phrase>and the definition of these states, which is done in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī and Vibhaṅga; (b) the creation of a ”schedule” </phrase><emphasis>(mātikā) </emphasis><phrase>consisting of a set of triple </phrase><emphasis>(tika) </emphasis><phrase>and double </phrase><emphasis>(duka) </emphasis><phrase>classifications for sorting these states; and (c) the enumeration of twenty-four kinds of conditioning relations </phrase><emphasis>(paccaya), </emphasis><phrase>which is done in the Paṭṭhāna. The states as defined are thus, as it were, momentary “stills”; the structure of relations combines the stills into continuities; the schedule classifications indicate the direction of the continuities.</phrase></para><para><phrase>The three Abhidhamma books already mentioned are the essential basis for what later came to be called the “Abhidhamma method”: together they form an integral whole. The other four books, which may be said to support them in various technical fields, need not be discussed here. This, then, is a bare outline of what is in fact an enormous maze with many unexplored side-turnings.</phrase></para><para><phrase>(3) The system found in the Commentaries has moved on (perhaps slightly diverged) from the strict Abhidhamma Piṭaka standpoint. The Suttas offered descriptions of discovery; the Abhidhamma map-making; but emphasis now is not on discovery, or even on mapping, so much as on consolidating, filling in and explaining. The material is worked over for consistency. Among the principal new developments here are these. The “cognitive series” (</phrase><emphasis>citta-vīthi</emphasis><phrase>) in the occurrence of the conscious process is organized (see </phrase><link linkend="IV.n13">Ch. IV, n.13</link><phrase> and Table V) and completed, and its association with three different kinds of kamma is laid down. The term </phrase><emphasis>sabhāva</emphasis><phrase> (“individual essence,” “own-being” or “it-ness,” see </phrase><link linkend="VII.n68">Ch. VII, n.68</link><phrase>) is introduced to explain the key word </phrase><emphasis>dhamma</emphasis><phrase>, thereby submitting that term to ontological criticism, while the </phrase><emphasis>samaya</emphasis><phrase> (“event” or “occasion”) of the Dhammasaṅgaṇī is now termed a </phrase><emphasis>khaṇa</emphasis><phrase> (“moment”), thus shifting the weight and balance a little in the treatment of time. Then there is the specific ascription of the three “instants” (</phrase><emphasis>khaṇa</emphasis><phrase>, too) of arising, presence and dissolution (</phrase><emphasis>uppāda-ṭṭhiti-bhaṅga</emphasis><phrase>) to each “moment” (</phrase><emphasis>khaṇa</emphasis><phrase>), one “material moment” being calculated to last as long as sixteen “mental moments” (</phrase><link linkend="XX.24">XX.24</link><phrase>; </phrase><phrase><citation>Dhs-a</citation><phrase> 60</phrase></phrase><phrase>).</phrase><footnote><para><phrase>The legitimateness of the mental moment of “presence” </phrase><emphasis>(ṭhiti) </emphasis><phrase>as deducible from </phrase><phrase><citation>A</citation><phrase> I 152</phrase></phrase><phrase> is questioned by Ācariya Ānanda (</phrase><citation>Vibh-ṭ</citation><phrase>), who wrote early in the Middle Period; he cites the Yamaka (refs.: II 13–14; and I 216-17) against it.</phrase></para></footnote><phrase>New to the Piṭakas are also the rather unwieldy enumeration of concepts </phrase><emphasis>(paññatti, </emphasis><phrase>see </phrase><link linkend="VIII.n11">Ch. VIII, n.11</link><phrase>), and the </phrase><literal>[49|xlvii]</literal><phrase>handy defining-formula of word-meaning, characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause (locus); also many minor instances such as the substitution of the specific “heart-basis” for the Paṭṭhāna’s “material basis of mind,” the conception of “material octads,” etc., the detailed descriptions of the thirty-two parts of the body instead of the bare enumeration of the names in the Suttas (thirty-one in the four Nikāyas and thirty-two in the Khuddakapāṭha and the Paṭisambhidāmagga), and many more. And the word </phrase><emphasis>paramattha </emphasis><phrase>acquires a new and slightly altered currency. The question of how much this process of development owes to the post-Mauryan evolution of Sanskrit thought on the Indian mainland (either through assimilation or opposition) still remains to be explored, like so many others in this field.

Mainly either epistemological and psychological, or else linguistic, they relate either to what ideas and things are being discussed, or else to the manipulation of dictionary meanings of words used in discussion.</phrase></para><para><phrase>The first is perhaps dominant. As mentioned earlier, the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga </emphasis><phrase>can be properly studied only as part of the whole commentarial edifice, whose cornerstone it is. But while indexes of words and subjects to the PTS edition of the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga </emphasis><phrase>exist, most of its author’s works have only indexes of Piṭaka words and names commented on but none for the mass of subject matter. So the student has to make his own. Of the commentaries too, only the </phrase><emphasis>Atthasālinī, </emphasis><phrase>the Dhammapada Commentary, and the Jātaka Commentary have so far been translated (and the latter two are rather in a separate class). But that is a minor aspect.</phrase></para><para><phrase>This book is largely technical and presents all the difficulties peculiar to technical translation: it deals, besides, with mental happenings. Now where many synonyms are used, as they often are in Pali, for public material objects—an elephant, say, or gold or the sun—the “material objects” should be pointable to, if there is doubt about what is referred to. Again even such generally recognized private experiences as those referred to by the words “consciousness” or “pain” seem too obvious to introspection for uncertainty to arise (communication to fail) if they are given variant symbols. Here the English translator can forsake the Pali allotment of synonyms and indulge a liking for “elegant variation,” if he has it, without fear of muddle. But mind is fluid, as it were, and materially negative, and its analysis needs a different and a strict treatment. In the Suttas, and still more in the Abhidhamma, charting by analysis and definition of pin-pointed mental states is carried far into unfamiliar waters. It was already recognized then that this is no more a solid landscape of “things” to be pointed to when variation has resulted in vagueness. As an instance of disregard of this fact: a greater scholar with impeccable historical and philological judgment (perhaps the most eminent of the English translators) has in a single work rendered the </phrase><emphasis>cattāro satipaṭṭhāna </emphasis><phrase>(here represented by “four foundations of mindfulness”) by “four inceptions of deliberation,” “fourfold setting up of mindfulness,” “fourfold setting up of starting,” “four applications of mindfulness,” and other variants. The PED foreword observes: “No one needs now to use the one English word ‘desire’ as a translation of sixteen distinct Pali words, no one of which means precisely desire. Yet this was done in Vol. X of the</phrase><emphasis> Sacred Books of the East</emphasis><phrase> by Max Müller and Fausböll.” True; but need one go to the other extreme? How without looking up the Pali can one be sure if the same idea is </phrase><literal>[53|li]</literal><phrase>referred to by all these variants and not some other such as those referred to by </phrase><emphasis>cattāro iddhipādā (“</emphasis><phrase>four roads to power” or “bases of success”), </phrase><emphasis>cattāro sammappadhānā </emphasis><phrase>(“four right endeavours”), etc., or one of the many other “fours”? It is customary not to vary, say, the “call for the categorical imperative” in a new context by some such alternative as “uncompromising order” or “plain-speaking bidding” or “call for unconditional surrender,” which the dictionaries would justify, or “faith” which the exegetists might recommend; that is to say, if it is hoped to avoid confusion. The choosing of an adequate rendering is, however, a quite different problem.</phrase></para><para><phrase>But there is something more to be considered before coming to that. So far only the difficulty of isolating, symbolizing, and describing individual mental states has been touched on. But here the whole mental structure with its temporal-dynamic process is dealt with too. Identified mental as well as material states (none of which can arise independently) must be recognizable with their associations when encountered in new circumstances: for here arises the central question of thought-association and its manipulation. That is tacitly recognized in the Pali. If disregarded in the English rendering the tenuous structure with its inferences and negations—the flexible pattern of thought-associations—can no longer be communicated or followed, because the pattern of speech no longer reflects it, and whatever may be communicated is only fragmentary and perhaps deceptive. Renderings of words have to be distinguished, too, from renderings of words used to explain those words. From this aspect the Oriental system of word-by-word translation, which transliterates the sound of the principal substantive and verb stems and attaches to them local inflections, has much to recommend it, though, of course, it is not readable as “literature.” One is handling instead of pictures of isolated ideas or even groups of ideas a whole coherent chart system. And besides, words, like maps and charts, are conventionally used to represent high dimensions.</phrase></para><para><phrase>When already identified states or currents are encountered from new angles, the new situation can be verbalized in one of two ways at least: either by using in a new appropriate verbal setting the words already allotted to these states, or by describing the whole situation afresh in different terminology chosen </phrase><emphasis>ad hoc. </emphasis><phrase>While the second may gain in individual brightness, connections with other allied references can hardly fail to be lost. Aerial photographs must be taken from consistent altitudes, if they are to be used for making maps. And words serve the double purpose of recording ideas already formed and of arousing new ones.</phrase></para><para><phrase>Structural coherence between different parts in the Pali of the present work needs reflecting in the translation—especially in the last ten chapters—if the thread is not soon to be lost. In fact, in the Pali (just as much in the Tipiṭaka as in its Commentaries), when such subjects are being handled, one finds that a tacit rule, “One term and one flexible definition for one idea (or state or event or situation) referred to,” is adhered to pretty thoroughly. The reason has already been made clear. With no such rule, ideas are apt to disintegrate or coalesce or fictitiously multiply (and, of course, any serious attempt at indexing in English is stultified). </phrase><literal>[54|lii]</literal><phrase>One thing needs to be made clear, though; for there is confusion of thought on this whole subject (one so far only partly investigated).</phrase><footnote><para><phrase>See Prof. I. A. Richards, </phrase><emphasis>Mencius on Mind,</emphasis><phrase> Kegan Paul, 1932.</phrase></para></footnote><phrase>This “rule of parsimony in variants” has nothing to do with mechanical transliteration, which is a translator’s refuge when he is unsure of himself. The guiding rule, “One recognizable idea, one word, or phrase to symbolize it,” in no sense implies any such rule as, “One Pali word, one English word,” which is neither desirable nor practicable. Nor in translating need the rule apply beyond the scope reviewed.</phrase></para><para><phrase>So much for the epistemological and psychological problems.</phrase></para><para><phrase>The linguistic problem is scarcely less formidable though much better recognized. While English is extremely analytic, Pali (another Indo-European language) is one of the groups of tongues regarded as dominated by Sanskrit, strongly agglutinative, forming long compounds and heavily inflected. The vocabulary chosen occasioned much heart-searching but is still very imperfect. If a few of the words encountered seem a bit algebraical at first, contexts and definitions should make them clear. In the translation of an Oriental language, especially a classical one, the translator must recognize that such knowledge which the Oriental reader is taken for granted to possess is lacking in his European counterpart, who tends unawares to fill the gaps from his own foreign store: the result can be like taking two pictures on one film. Not only is the common background evoked by the words shadowy and patchy, but European thought and Indian thought tend to approach the problems of human existence from opposite directions. This affects word formations. And so double meanings (utraquisms, puns, and metaphors) and etymological links often follow quite different tracks, a fact which is particularly intrusive in describing mental events, where the terms employed are mainly “material” ones used metaphorically. Unwanted contexts constantly creep in and wanted ones stay out. Then there are no well-defined techniques for recognizing and handling idioms, literal rendering of which misleads (while, say, one may not wonder whether to render </phrase><emphasis>tour de force </emphasis><phrase>by “enforced tour” or “tower of strength,” one cannot always be so confident in Pali).</phrase></para><para><phrase>Then again in the </phrase><emphasis>Visuddhimagga </emphasis><phrase>alone the actual words and word-meanings not in the PED come to more than two hundred and forty. The PED, as its preface states, is “essentially preliminary”; for when it was published many books had still not been collated; it leaves out many words even from the Sutta Piṭaka, and the Sub-commentaries are not touched by it. Also—and most important here—in the making of that dictionary the study of Pali literature had for the most part not been tackled much from, shall one say, the philosophical, or better, epistemological, angle,</phrase><footnote><para><phrase>Exceptions are certain early works of Mrs. C.A.F. Rhys Davids. See also discussions in appendixes to the translations of the Kathāvatthu (</phrase><emphasis>Points of Controversy</emphasis><phrase>, PTS) and the </phrase><emphasis>Abhidhammatthasaṅgaha</emphasis><phrase> (</phrase><emphasis>Compendium of Philosophy</emphasis><phrase>, PTS).</phrase></para></footnote><phrase>work and interest having been concentrated till then almost exclusively on history and philology. For instance, the epistemologically unimportant word </phrase><emphasis>vimāna </emphasis><phrase>(divine mansion) is given more than twice the space allotted to the term </phrase><emphasis>paṭicca-samuppāda </emphasis><phrase>(dependent origination), a difficult subject of central importance, the article on which is altogether inadequate and misleading (owing partly to misapplication of the “historical method”). Then </phrase><emphasis>gala </emphasis><phrase>(throat) has been found more </phrase><literal>[55|liii]</literal><phrase>glossarialy interesting than </phrase><emphasis>paṭisandhi </emphasis><phrase>(rebirth-linking), the original use of which word at </phrase><phrase><citation>M</citation><phrase> III 230</phrase></phrase><phrase> is ignored. Under </phrase><emphasis>nāma, </emphasis><phrase>too, </phrase><emphasis>nāma-rūpa</emphasis><phrase> is confused with </phrase><emphasis>nāma-kāya. </emphasis><phrase>And so one might continue. By this, however, it is not intended at all to depreciate that great dictionary, but only to observe that in using it the Pali student has sometimes to be wary: if it is criticized in particular here (and it can well hold its own against criticism), tribute must also be paid to its own inestimable general value.</phrase></para></section><section><title><phrase>Concluding remarks</phrase></title><para><phrase>Current standard English has been aimed at and preference given always to simplicity. This has often necessitated cutting up long involved sentences, omitting connecting particles (such as </phrase><emphasis>pana, pan’ettha, yasmā </emphasis><phrase>when followed by </phrase><emphasis>tasmā, hi, kho, </emphasis><phrase>etc.), which serve simply as grammatical grease in long chains of subordinate periods. Conversely the author is sometimes extraordinarily elliptic (as in </phrase><link linkend="XIV.46">XIV.46</link><phrase> and </phrase><link linkend="XVI.68">XVI.68f.</link><phrase>), and then the device of square brackets has been used to add supplementary matter, without which the sentence would be too enigmatically shorthand.

Of course, the warding off of the perils of climate is stated by [the phrase] “protection from cold,” etc., too; but, just as in the case of making use of the robes the concealment of the private parts is stated as an invariable purpose while the others are periodical [purposes], so here also this [last] should be understood as mentioned with reference to the invariable warding off of the perils of climate.

According to </phrase><varname>(102)</varname><phrase> these there are only six types of persons, that is, one of greedy temperament, one of hating temperament, one of deluded temperament, one of faithful temperament, one of intelligent temperament, and one of speculative temperament.</phrase></para></formalpara><formalpara label="III.75" xml:id="III.75"><title>§75</title><para><phrase>Herein, one of faithful temperament is parallel to one of greedy temperament because faith is strong when profitable [kamma] occurs in one of greedy </phrase><literal>[155|97]</literal><phrase>temperament, owing to its special qualities being near to those of greed.

Roughly </phrase><emphasis>dhamma</emphasis><phrase> = what-can-be-remembered or what-can-be-borne-in-mind (</phrase><emphasis>dhāretabba</emphasis><phrase>) as </phrase><emphasis>kamma</emphasis><phrase> = what-can-be-done (</phrase><emphasis>kātabba</emphasis><phrase>). The following two principal (and overlapping) senses are involved here: (i) the Law as taught, and (ii) objects of consciousness. (i) In the first case the word has either been left untranslated as “Dhamma” or “dhamma” or it has been tendered as “Law” or “law.” This ranges from the loose sense of the “Good Law,” “cosmic law,” and “teaching” to such specific technical senses as the “discrimination of law,” “causality,” “being subject to or having the nature of.” (ii) In the second case the word in its looser sense of “something known or thought of” has either been left untranslated as “dhamma” or rendered by “state” (more rarely by “thing” or “phenomenon”), while in its technical sense as one of the twelve bases or eighteen elements “mental object” and “mental datum” have been used. The sometimes indiscriminate use of “dhamma,” “state” and “law” in both the looser senses is deliberate. The English words have been reserved as far as possible for rendering </phrase><emphasis>dhamma</emphasis><phrase> (except that “state” has sometimes been used to render </phrase><emphasis>bhāva</emphasis><phrase>, etc., in the sense of “-ness”). Other subsidiary meanings of a non-technical nature have occasionally been otherwise rendered according to context.</phrase></para><para><phrase>In order to avoid muddle it is necessary to distinguish renderings of the word </phrase><emphasis>dhamma</emphasis><phrase> and renderings of the words used to define it. The word itself is a gerundive of the verb </phrase><emphasis>dharati </emphasis><phrase>(caus. </phrase><emphasis>dhāreti—</emphasis><phrase>“to bear”) and so is the literal equivalent of “[quality] that is to be borne.” But since the grammatical meanings of the two words </phrase><emphasis>dharati</emphasis><phrase> (“to bear”) and </phrase><emphasis>dahati </emphasis><phrase>(“to put or sort out,” whence </phrase><emphasis>dhātu—</emphasis><phrase>“element”) sometimes coalesce, it often comes very close to </phrase><emphasis>dhātu</emphasis><phrase> (but see VIII n. 68 and </phrase><link linkend="XI.104">XI.104</link><phrase>). If it is asked, what bears the qualities to be borne? A correct answer here would probably be that it is the event (</phrase><emphasis>samaya</emphasis><phrase>), as stated in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī (§1, etc.), in which the various dhammas listed there arise and are present, variously related to each other. The word </phrase><emphasis>dhammin</emphasis><phrase> (thing qualified or “bearer of what is to be borne”) is a late introduction as a logical term (perhaps first used in Pali by </phrase><citation>Vism-mhṭ</citation><phrase>, see p. 534).</phrase></para><para><phrase>As to the definitions of the word, there are several.

So they are not different kinds of knowledge. And there must be no reservation, otherwise it would follow that omniscient and unobstructed knowledge had obstructions and did not make all dhammas its object. There is not in fact a minimal obstruction to the</phrase></para><para><phrase>Blessed One’s knowledge: and if his unobstructed knowledge did not have all dhammas as its object, there would be presence of obstruction where it did not occur, and so it would not be unobstructed.</phrase></para><para><phrase>“Or alternatively, even if we suppose that they are different, still it is omniscient knowledge itself that is intended as ‘unhindered’ since it is that which occurs unhindered universally.

And it is said accordingly in the Paṭisambhidā: ‘This is a name derived from the final liberation of the Enlightened Ones, the Blessed Ones, together with the acquisition of omniscient knowledge at the root of the Enlightenment Tree; this name “Buddha” is a designation based on realization’ (</phrase><phrase><citation>Paṭis</citation><phrase> I 174</phrase></phrase><phrase>). For the ability in the Blessed One’s continuity to penetrate all dhammas without exception was due to his having completely attained to knowledge capable of becoming aware of all dhammas.</phrase></para><para><phrase>“Here it may be asked: But how then? When this knowledge occurs, does it do so with respect to every field simultaneously, or successively? For firstly, if it occurs simultaneously with respect to every objective field, then with the simultaneous appearance of formed dhammas classed as past, future and present, internal and external, etc., and of unformed and conventional (conceptual) dhammas, there would be no awareness of contrast (</phrase><emphasis>paṭibhāga</emphasis><phrase>), as happens in one who looks at a painted canvas from a distance. That being so, it follows that all dhammas become the objective field of the Blessed One’s knowledge in an undifferentiated form (</phrase><emphasis>anirūpita-rūpana</emphasis><phrase>), as they do through the aspect of not-self to those who are exercising insight thus ’All dhammas are not-self’ (Dhp 279; Th 678; </phrase><phrase><citation>M</citation><phrase> I 230</phrase></phrase><phrase>; II 64; </phrase><phrase><citation>S</citation><phrase> III 132</phrase></phrase><phrase>; </phrase><phrase><citation>A</citation><phrase> I 286</phrase></phrase><phrase>; IV 14; </phrase><phrase><citation>Paṭis</citation><phrase> II 48</phrase></phrase><phrase>, 62; </phrase><phrase><citation>Vin</citation><phrase> I 86</phrase></phrase><phrase>. Cf. also </phrase><phrase><citation>A</citation><phrase> III 444</phrase></phrase><phrase>; IV 88, 338; </phrase><phrase><citation>Sn</citation><phrase> 1076</phrase></phrase><phrase>). And those do not escape this difficulty who say that the Enlightened One’s knowledge occurs with the characteristic of presence of all knowable dhammas as its objective field, devoid of discriminative thinking (</phrase><emphasis>vikappa-rahita</emphasis><phrase>), and universal in time (</phrase><emphasis>sabba-kāla</emphasis><phrase>) and that is why they are called ’All-seeing’ and why it is said, ’The Nāga is concentrated walking and he is concentrated standing’ (?).</phrase></para><para><phrase>They do not escape the difficulty since the Blessed One’s knowledge would then have only a partial objective field, because, by having the characteristic of presence as its object, past, future and conventional dhammas, which lack that characteristic, would be absent. So it is wrong to say that it occurs simultaneously with respect to every objective field. Then secondly, if we say that it occurs successively with respect to every objective field, that is wrong too. For when the knowable, classed in the many different ways according to birth, place, individual essence, etc., and direction, place, time, etc., is apprehended successively, then penetration without remainder is not effected since the knowable is infinite. And those are wrong too who say that the Blessed One is All-seeing owing to his doing his defining by taking one part of the knowable as that actually experienced (</phrase><emphasis>paccakkha</emphasis><phrase>) and deciding that the rest is the same because of the unequivocalness of its meaning, and that such knowledge is not inferential (</phrase><emphasis>anumānika</emphasis><phrase>) since it is free from doubt, because it is what is doubtfully discovered that is meant by inferential knowledge in the world. And they are wrong because there is no such defining by taking one part of the knowable as that actually experienced and deciding that the rest is the same because of the unequivocalness of its meaning, without making all of it actually experienced. For then that ‘rest’ is not actually experienced; and if it were actually experienced, it would no longer be ‘the rest.’</phrase></para><para><phrase>“All that is no argument.—Why not?—Because this is not a field for ratiocination; for the Blessed One has said this: ‘The objective field of Enlightened Ones is unthinkable, it cannot be thought out; anyone who tried to think it out would reap madness and frustration’ (</phrase><phrase><citation>A</citation><phrase> II 80</phrase></phrase><phrase>). The agreed explanation here is this: Whatever the Blessed One wants to know—either entirely or partially—there his knowledge occurs as actual experience because it does so without hindrance. And it has constant concentration because of the absence of distraction. And it cannot occur in association with wishing of a kind that is due to absence from the objective field of something that he wants to know. There can be no exception to this because of the words, ‘All dhammas are available to the adverting of the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, are available at his wish, are available to his attention, are available to his thought’ (</phrase><phrase><citation>Paṭis</citation><phrase> II 195</phrase></phrase><phrase>). And the Blessed One’s knowledge that has the past and future as its objective field is entirely actual experience since it is devoid of assumption based on inference, tradition or conjecture.</phrase></para><para><phrase>“And yet, even in that case, suppose he wanted to know the whole in its entirety, then would his knowledge not occur without differentiation in the whole objective field simultaneously? And so there would still be no getting out of that difficulty? “That is not so, because of its purifiedness. Because the Enlightened One’s objective field is purified and it is unthinkable. Otherwise there would be no unthinkableness in the knowledge of the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, if it occurred in the same way as that of ordinary people. So, although it occurs with all dhammas as its object, it nevertheless does so making those dhammas quite clearly defined, as though it had a single dhamma as its object. This is what is unthinkable here. ‘</phrase></para><para><phrase>There is as much knowledge as there is knowable, there is as much knowable as there is knowledge; the knowledge is limited by the knowable, the knowable is limited by the knowledge’ (Paṭis II l95).

For dissolution is the furthest extreme of impermanence. So the meditator who is contemplating dissolution by its means sees under the heading of consciousness the whole field of formations as impermanent, not as permanent; and because of the suffering inherent in what is impermanent, and because of the absence of self in what is painful, he sees that same whole field of formations as painful, not as pleasant, and as not-self, not as self. But since what is impermanent, painful, and not-self is not something to delight in, and what is not something to delight in is not something to be greedy for, consequently he becomes dispassionate towards that whole field of formations when it is seen in the light of dissolution as impermanent, painful, not-self, he does not delight in it, and his greed for it fades away, does not dye him. Now, as he thus becomes dispassionate and his greed fades away, it is firstly by means of mundane knowledge only that he causes greed to cease and does not arouse it. The meaning is that he does not bring about its arising. Or alternatively, his greed having thus faded away, he causes by means of his own knowledge the cessation of the unseen field of formations just as that of the seen, he does not arouse it; the meaning is that he brings about only its cessation, he does not bring about its arising. Having entered on this way, he relinquishes, he does not grasp. What is meant? It is that this contemplation of impermanence, etc., is called relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into because it gives up defilements along with aggregate-producing kamma-formations and because, by seeing the flaws in what is formed and by inclining towards the opposite of what is formed, namely Nibbāna, it enters into that Nibbāna. Consequently the meditator who has that contemplation gives up defilements and enters into Nibbāna in the way stated. Herein, the contemplation of what is impermanent as only impermanent is ‘contemplation of impermanence’; this is a name for insight that occurs by taking formations of the three [mundane] planes [and leaving aside the supramundane] as impermanent. ‘From the perception of permanence’: from the wrong perception that occurs perceiving formed things as permanent, eternal; also the various views should be regarded as included under the heading of perception. Likewise with the perception of pleasure and so on. ‘By means of the contemplation of dispassion’: by means of the contemplation that occurs in the mode of dispassion for formations. ‘From delight’: from craving accompanied by happiness. ‘By means of the contemplation of fading away’: by means of the contemplation that occurs similarly in the mode of fading away; hence ‘delivering from greed’ is said. ‘By means of the contemplation of cessation’: by means of the successive seeing of formations’ cessation. Or contemplating cessation is contemplation such that formations cease only and do not arise with future renewal. For this is knowledge of desire for deliverance grown strong. Hence he said, ‘delivering from arousing.’ Contemplation that occurs in the mode of relinquishing is ‘contemplation of relinquishment.’ ‘From grasping’: from taking as permanent, etc.; or the meaning can also here be regarded as ‘from grasping rebirth-linking.’ (</phrase><phrase><citation>Vism-mhṭ</citation><phrase> 279</phrase></phrase><phrase>) See Chapters XX and XXI.</phrase></para></footnote><phrase> ’” So this tetrad should be understood to deal with contemplation of mind.</phrase></para></formalpara></section><section><title><phrase>Word Commentary Continued—Fourth Tetrad</phrase></title><formalpara label="VIII.234" xml:id="VIII.234"><title>§234</title><para><literal>[341|283]</literal><phrase>(xiii) But in the fourth tetrad, as to </phrase><emphasis>contemplating impermanence</emphasis><phrase>, here firstly, the impermanent should be understood, and impermanence, and the contemplation of impermanence, and one contemplating impermanence.</phrase></para><para><phrase>Herein, the five aggregates are </phrase><emphasis>the impermanent</emphasis><phrase>.

Relinquishment itself as [a way of] contemplation is “contemplation of relinquishment.” For insight is called both “relinquishment as giving up” and “relinquishment as entering into” since [firstly], through substitution of opposite qualities, it gives up defilements with their aggregate-producing kamma formations, and [secondly], through seeing the wretchedness of what is formed, it also enters into Nibbāna by inclining towards Nibbāna, which is the opposite of the formed (</phrase><link linkend="XI.18">XI.18</link><phrase>). Also the path is called both “relinquishment as giving up” and “relinquishment as entering into” since it gives up defilements with their aggregate-producing kamma-formations by cutting them off, and it enters into Nibbāna by making it its object. Also both [insight and path knowledge] are called contemplation (</phrase><emphasis>anupassanā</emphasis><phrase>) because of their re-seeing successively (</phrase><emphasis>anu anu passanā</emphasis><phrase>) each preceding kind of knowledge.</phrase><footnote label="VIII.n68" xml:id="VIII.n68"><para><phrase>“The act of relinquishing as the act of giving up by means of substituting for what should be abandoned its opposite quality or by cutting it off, is ‘relinquishment as giving up.’ Likewise the act of relinquishing of self that takes place in non-formation of kamma, which is the relinquishing of all substrata (circumstances) of becoming, being the entering into that [Nibbāna] either by inclination towards it [in insight] or by having it as object [in the path] is ‘relinquishment as entering into.’ ‘Through substitution of opposite qualities’: here contemplation of impermanence, firstly, gives up perception of permanence by abandoning through substitution of the opposite [e.g. substituting perception of impermanence for that of permanence in the case of all formed things]. And the giving up in this way is in the form of inducing non-occurrence. For all kamma-formations that are rooted in defilements due to apprehending (formations) as permanent, and the kamma-resultant aggregates rooted in both which might arise in the future, are abandoned by causing their non-occurrence.

On his return he attained Nibbāna in the same moment in which he stepped on the line. </phrase><varname>(293)</varname></para><linegroup><speaker/><line><phrase>So let a man, if he is wise,</phrase></line><line><phrase>Untiringly devote his days</phrase></line><line><phrase>To mindfulness of breathing, which</phrase></line><line><phrase>Rewards him always in these ways.</phrase></line></linegroup><para><phrase>This is the section dealing with mindfulness of breathing in the detailed explanation.</phrase></para></formalpara></section></section><section><title><phrase>(10) Recollection of Peace</phrase></title><formalpara label="VIII.245" xml:id="VIII.245"><title>§245</title><para><phrase>One who wants to develop the recollection of peace mentioned next to mindfulness of breathing (</phrase><link linkend="III.105">III.105</link><phrase>) should go into solitary retreat and recollect the special qualities of Nibbāna, in other words, the stilling of all suffering, as follows: </phrase><literal>[345|287]</literal><phrase>“Bhikkhus, in so far as there are dhammas, whether formed or unformed, fading away is pronounced the best of them, that is to say, the disillusionment of vanity, the elimination of thirst, the abolition of reliance, the termination of the round, the destruction of craving, fading away, cessation, Nibbāna” (</phrase><phrase><citation>A</citation><phrase> II 34</phrase></phrase><phrase>).</phrase></para></formalpara><formalpara label="VIII.246" xml:id="VIII.246"><title>§246</title><para><phrase>Herein in </phrase><emphasis>so far as </emphasis><phrase>means as many as. </phrase><emphasis>Dhammas </emphasis><phrase>[means] individual essences.</phrase><footnote label="VIII.n69" xml:id="VIII.n69"><para><phrase>“In such passages as ‘Dhammas that are concepts’ (</phrase><phrase><citation>Dhs</citation><phrase> p. 1</phrase></phrase><phrase>, §1308) even a non-entity (</phrase><emphasis>abhāva</emphasis><phrase>) is thus called a ‘dhamma’ since it is borne (</phrase><emphasis>dhārīyati</emphasis><phrase>) and affirmed (</phrase><emphasis>avadhārīyati</emphasis><phrase>) by knowledge.

Strictly it refers here to the triple moment of arising etc., of formed dhammas that can have such “existence” in their own right and be experienced as such; and it refers to the realizability of Nibbāna.

Consciousness knows the objects as blue or yellow, and it brings about the penetration of its characteristics, but it cannot bring about, by endeavouring, the manifestation of the [supramundane] path.

But when their arising is due to kamma that is one, how does there come to be differentiation among them? It is due to dividedness in the cause too. For it is craving, in the form of longing for this or that kind of becoming that, itself having specific forms owing to hankering after the sense-bases included in some kind of becoming or other, contrives, acting as decisive-support, the specific divisions in the kamma that generates such a kind of becoming. As soon as the kamma has acquired the differentiation induced by that [hankering] it generates through effort consisting in appropriate ability a multiple fruit with differentiated individual essences, as though it had itself taken on a multiple form. And the ability here need not be understood as anything other than the able state; for it is simply the effort of producing fruit that is differentiated by the differentiation due to the differentiation in its cause. And the fact of this differentiating effort on the part of kamma that is one being the cause of the multiple faculties will be dealt with below as to logic and texts (note 21).

Consequently it remains in the same place where it arose, if it comes into focus in the ear avenue (so the Burmese ed.). Are not the sounds of washermen [beating their washing on stones] heard later by those who stand at a distance? No; because there is a difference in the way of apprehending a sound according to the ways in which it becomes evident to one nearby and to one at a distance. For just as, because of difference in the way of apprehending the sound of words according to the ways in which it becomes evident to one at a distance and to one nearby, there comes to be [respectively] not apprehending, and apprehending of the differences in the syllables, so also, when the sound of washermen (a) becomes [an occurrence] that is evident throughout from beginning to end to one who is nearby, and (b) becomes an occurrence that is evident in compressed form in the end or in the middle to one who is at a distance, it is because there is a difference in the apprehending and definition, which occur later in the cognitive series of ear-consciousness, that there comes to be the assumption </phrase><emphasis>(abhimāna) </emphasis><phrase>‘Heard faintly is heard later.’ But that sound comes into the ear’s focus at the moment of its own existence and in dependence on the place where it arises (see XIII. 112; </phrase><phrase><citation>Dhs-a</citation><phrase> 313</phrase></phrase><phrase>).

Its not being mentioned there is for another reason. What is that? Non-inconsistency of the teaching. For while eye consciousness, etc., have the eye, etc., as their respective supports absolutely, mind-consciousness does not in the same way have the heart-basis as its support absolutely. And the teaching in the physical-basis dyad </phrase><emphasis>(vatthu-duka) </emphasis><phrase>is given by way of the material support thus, ‘There is matter that is the physical basis of eye-consciousness, there is matter that is not the physical basis of eye-consciousness’ (</phrase><phrase><citation>Dhs</citation><phrase> §585</phrase></phrase><phrase>) and so on; and if the dyads were stated by way of what had the heart-basis absolutely as its support thus, ‘There is matter that is the physical basis of mind-consciousness’ and so on, then the object dyads </phrase><emphasis>(ārammaṇa-duka) </emphasis><phrase>do not fall into line: for one cannot say: ‘There is matter that is the object of mind-consciousness, there is matter that is not the object of mind-consciousness.’ So the physical-basis dyads and object dyads being thus made inconsistent, the teaching would lack unity, and the Master’s wish was to give the teaching here in a form that has unity. That is why the heart-basis is not mentioned, not because it is unapprehendable.</phrase></para><para><phrase>“(ii) But the logical reasoning should be understood in this way. In the five constituent becoming, [that is, in the sense sphere and fine-material sphere,] these two elements have as their support produced </phrase><emphasis>(nipphanna) </emphasis><phrase>derived matter. Herein, since the visible-data base, etc., and nutritive essence, are found to occur apart from what is bound up with faculties, to make them the support would be illogical. And since these two elements are found in a continuity that is devoid of the femininity and masculinity faculties [i.e. in the Brahmā-world], to make them the support would be illogical too. And in the case of the life faculty that would have to have another function, so to make it the support would be illogical too. So it is the heart-basis that remains to be recognized as their support. For it is possible to say that these two elements have as their support produced derived matter, since existence is bound up with matter in the five-constituent becoming. Whatever has its existence bound up with matter is found to have as its support produced derived matter, as the eye-consciousness-element does. And the distinction ‘in the five-constituent becoming’ is made on account of the mind-consciousness-element; in the four-constituent becoming, [that is, the immaterial sphere,] there is no mind-element. Does there not follow contradiction of the middle term </phrase><emphasis>(hetu) </emphasis><phrase>because of establishing faculties as their support? No; because that is disproved by what is seen. For these two elements are not, as in the case of eye-consciousness, controlled by the slackness and keenness, etc., of their physical basis; and accordingly it is not said in the texts that they have the faculties as their condition. Hence their having faculties as their support, in other words, their being controlled by them, is disproved.</phrase></para><para><phrase>“Granted that these two elements have as their support the derived matter consisting of the heart-basis, how is it to be known that it is kamma-originated, has an invariable function, and is to be found located in the heart?

Moving forward, etc., should be understood to occur owing to the movement of the [kinds of matter] that are temperature-born, etc., which are interlocked with the consciousness-born kinds moved by that [intimation]</phrase><footnote label="XIV.n27" xml:id="XIV.n27"><para><phrase>“It is the mode and the alteration of what? Of consciousness-originated primary elements that have the air-element in excess of capability. What is that capability? It is the state of being consciousness-born and the state of being derived matter. Or alternatively, it can be taken as the mode alteration of the air element. If that is so, then intimation is illogical as derived matter, for there is no derived matter with a single primary as its support, since ‘matter derived from the four great primaries’ (</phrase><phrase><citation>M</citation><phrase> I 53</phrase></phrase><phrase>) is said. That is not wrong. Alteration of one of the four is that of all four, as with wealth shared among four. And excess of air element in a material group </phrase><emphasis>(kalāpa) </emphasis><phrase>does not contradict the words ‘of the air element’; and excess is in capability, not in quantity, otherwise their inseparability would be illogical. According to some it is that of the air element only. In their opinion the state of derived matter is inapplicable </phrase><emphasis>(durupapāda) </emphasis><phrase>to intimation, since the alteration of one is not that of all. But this [air element] is apprehended by mind-door impulsion that is next to the non-intimating [apprehension] that is next to the apprehension of the appearance of motion in the movement of the hands, and so on. There is a certain kind of alteration that is separate from the appearance of motion. And the apprehension of the former is next to the apprehension of the latter. How is that to be known? By the apprehension of intention. For no apprehension of intention such as, ‘He is getting this done, it seems’ is met with in the case of trees’ movements, etc., which are devoid of intention. But it is met with in the case of hand movements and so on. Therefore there is a certain kind of alteration that is separate from the appearance of motion, and it is known as the ‘intimator of the intention.’ Also it is known by inference that the apprehension of the alteration is next to the apprehension of the appearance thus: The intimator intimates the meaning to be intimated only when it is apprehended as a cause, not merely as present. For they say accordingly:</phrase></para><para><phrase>Sounds that have entered no objective field Do not awaken any kind of meaning; And also beings merely recognized As such communicate no meanings either.</phrase></para><para><phrase>“If just the apprehension of the alteration is the reason for the apprehension of the intention, why is there no apprehension of intention in unapprehended communication </phrase><emphasis>(saṅketa)ī </emphasis><phrase>It is not only just the apprehension of the alteration that is the reason for the apprehension of the intention; but rather it should be taken that the apprehension of the previously-established connection is the decisive support for this. The stiffening, upholding, and movement are due to the air-element associated with the alteration belonging to the intimation, is what is said. What, is it all the air-element that does all those things? It is not like that. For it is the air element given rise to by the seventh impulsion that, by acquiring as its reinforcing conditions the air elements given rise to by the preceding impulsions, moves consciousness-originated matter by acting as cause for its successive arisings in adjacent locations, </phrase><emphasis>(desantaruppatti—</emphasis><phrase>cf. </phrase><link linkend="VIII">Ch. VIII</link><phrase>, n. 54) not the others. The others, however, help it by doing the stiffening and upholding, the successive arising in adjacent locations being itself the movement. So the instrumentality should be taken as attributed when there is the sign [of movement]; otherwise there would not be uninterestedness and momentariness of dhammas. And here the cart to be drawn by seven yokes is given as simile in the Commentary. But when consciousness-born matter moves, the kinds of matter born of temperature, kamma, and nutriment move too because they are bound up with it, like a piece of dry cow-dung thrown into a river’s current.</phrase></para><para><phrase>“Since it has been said that the apprehension of intimation is next to the apprehension of the appearance of motion, how then, is the air element itself as the maker of the movement accompanied by the alteration consisting in the intimation? It is not like that. It is the air elements given rise to by the first impulsion, etc., and which are unable to cause movement in that way and perform only the stiffening and upholding, that should be taken as only accompanied by the alteration belonging to intimation. For it is the alteration coexistent with the intention that is the intimation, because of giving rise to alteration in whatever direction it wishes to cause the occurrence of moving forward and so on. Taking it in this way, it is perfectly logical to say that the origination of intimation belongs to mind-door adverting. Since the intention possessed of the aforesaid alteration is intimated through the apprehension of that alteration, it is said that ‘Its function is to display intention.’ The air element being the cause of the motion of the bodily intimation, is figuratively said, as a state of alteration, to be ‘manifested as the cause of bodily motion.’ ‘Its proximate cause is the consciousness-originated air-element’ is said since the air element’s excessive function is the cause of intimating intention by movement of the body” (</phrase><phrase><citation>Vism-mhṭ</citation><phrase> 450–452</phrase></phrase><phrase>).

Because of the unreliability of the sensation of cold, like ‘beyond and not beyond.’ For in hot weather, while those who stand in the sun and go into the shade have the sensation of cold, yet those who go to the same place from an underground cave have the sensation of heat.

That of the life faculty is to maintain conascent states. That of the femininity faculty and the masculinity faculty is to allot the modes of the mark, sign, work and ways of women and men. That of the faculties of pleasure, pain, joy, and grief is to govern conascent states and impart their own particular mode of grossness to those states. That of the equanimity faculty is to impart to them the mode of quiet, superiority and neutrality. That of the faculties of faith, etc., is to overcome opposition and to impart to associated states the mode of confidence and so on. That of the “I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown” faculty is both to abandon three fetters and to confront associated states with the abandonment of them. That of the final-knowledge faculty is both to attenuate and abandon respectively lust, ill will, etc., and to subject conascent states to its own mastery.

The arguments used are merely supplementary to those in §69 here, and so are not quoted. The conclusion of the argument is worth noting, however, because of the emphasis on the words “</phrase><emphasis>taṃ āgamma</emphasis><phrase>.” It is this: “It is on coming to Nibbāna that greed, etc., are destroyed. It is the same Nibbāna that is called ‘destruction of greed, destruction of hate, destruction of delusion.’ These are just three terms for Nibbāna—When this was said, he asked: You say ‘On coming to’ (</phrase><emphasis>āgamma</emphasis><phrase>); from where have you got this ‘on coming to’?—It is got from the Suttas—Quote the sutta—‘Thus ignorance and craving, on coming to that, are destroyed in that, are abolished in that, nor does anything anywhere … (</phrase><emphasis>evaṃ avijjā ca taṇhā ca taṃ āgamma tamhi khīṇaṃ tamhi bhaggaṃ na ca kiñci kadāci</emphasis><phrase> … ).’ When this was said, the other was silent.” The quotation has not been traced.</phrase></para></footnote><phrase> it is therefore called “fading away” and “cessation.” And because there comes to be the giving up, etc., of that [craving] on coming to that [Nibbāna], and since there is not even one kind of reliance here [to be depended upon] from among the reliances consisting in the cords of sense desires, etc., it is therefore called </phrase><emphasis>giving it up, relinquishing it, letting it go, not relying on it.</emphasis></para></formalpara><formalpara label="XVI.66" xml:id="XVI.66"><title>§66</title><para><phrase>It has peace as its characteristic.

The coincidence of the three is contact. With contact as condition there is feeling. What a man feels that he perceives. What he perceives he thinks about.

Just as standing on the back of the one and supporting himself on the other’s shoulder he could pick as many flowers as he wanted, so too, when energy accomplishes its function of exerting and when mindfulness accomplishes its function of preventing wobbling, with the help so obtained concentration can bring about absorption by unification on the object.

Why not? Because there is no instance in which it has been added, and because the fallacy of the arising of an arising follows.

Why are they wrong? Because it is ignorance, etc., themselves that are called causes. For in the following passage it is ignorance, etc., themselves, not their alteration, that are called the causes [of these states]: “Therefore, Ānanda, just this is the cause, this is the source, this is the origin, this is the condition, for ageing-and-death, that is to say, birth … for formations, that is to say, (ignorance)” (</phrase><phrase><citation>D</citation><phrase> II 57–63</phrase></phrase><phrase>—the last clause is not in the Dīgha text).

It is unknowing about suffering, [unknowing about the origin of suffering, unknowing about the cessation of suffering, unknowing about the way leading to the cessation of suffering], unknowing about the past, unknowing about the future, unknowing about the past and future, unknowing about specific conditionality and conditionally-arisen states” (cf. </phrase><phrase><citation>Dhs</citation><phrase> §1162</phrase></phrase><phrase>).</phrase></para><formalpara label="XVII.59" xml:id="XVII.59"><title>§59</title><para><phrase>Herein, while ignorance about any instance that is not the two supra-mundane truths can also arise as object (see </phrase><link linkend="XVII.102">§102</link><phrase>), nevertheless here it is only intended [subjectively] as concealment.

Likewise, origin, cessation, and the path, bygone five aggregates called </phrase><emphasis>the past</emphasis><phrase>, coming five aggregates called </phrase><emphasis>the future</emphasis><phrase>, both of these together called </phrase><emphasis>the past and future</emphasis><phrase>, and both specific conditionality and conditionally-arisen states together called </phrase><emphasis>specific conditionality and conditionally-arisen states—</emphasis><phrase>all of which it keeps concealed, preventing their true individual </phrase><literal>[606|548]</literal><phrase>functions and characteristics being penetrated thus: “This is ignorance, these are formations.” That is why it is said, “It is unknowing about suffering … unknowing about specific conditionality and conditionally-arisen states.”</phrase></para></formalpara></section><section><title><phrase>(2) Formations</phrase></title><formalpara label="XVII.60" xml:id="XVII.60"><title>§60</title><para><emphasis>Formations</emphasis><phrase> are the six mentioned in brief above thus, “the three, namely, formations of merit, etc., and the three, namely, the bodily formation, etc.” (</phrase><link linkend="XVII.44">§44</link><phrase>); but in detail here the [first] three formations are twenty-nine volitions, that is to say, the formation of merit consisting of thirteen volitions, counting the eight sense-sphere profitable volitions that occur in giving, in virtue, etc., and the five fine-material profitable volitions that occur in development [of meditation]; then the formation of demerit consisting of the twelve unprofitable volitions that occur in killing living things, etc.; then the formation of the imperturbable consisting in the four profitable volitions associated with the immaterial sphere, which occur in development [of those meditations].</phrase></para></formalpara><formalpara label="XVII.61" xml:id="XVII.61"><title>§61</title><para><phrase>As regards the other three, the bodily formation is bodily volition, the verbal formation is verbal volition, and the mental formation is mental volition. This triad is mentioned in order to show that at the moment of the accumulation of the kamma the formations of merit, etc., occur in these [three] kamma doors. For the eight sense-sphere profitable and twelve unprofitable volitions, making twenty, are the bodily formation when they occur in the body door and produce bodily intimation. Those same volitions </phrase><varname>(531)</varname><phrase> are called the verbal formation when they occur in the speech door and produce verbal intimation. But volition connected with direct-knowledge is not included here in these two cases because it is not a condition for [resultant rebirth-linking] consciousness later. And like direct-knowledge volition, so also volition connected with agitation is not included; therefore that too should not be included as a condition for [rebirth-linking] consciousness. However, all these have ignorance as their condition. And all the twenty-nine volitions are the mental formation when they arise in the mind door without originating either kind of intimation. So this triad comes within the first triad, and accordingly, as far as the meaning is concerned, ignorance can be understood as condition simply for formations of merit and so on.</phrase></para></formalpara><formalpara label="XVII.62" xml:id="XVII.62"><title>§62</title><para><phrase>Herein, it might be [asked]: How can it be known that these formations have ignorance as their condition?—By the fact that they exist when ignorance exists. For when unknowing—in other words, ignorance—of suffering, etc., is unabandoned in a man, owing firstly to his unknowing about suffering and about the past, etc., then he believes the suffering of the round of rebirths to be pleasant and he embarks upon the three kinds of formations which are the cause of that very suffering. Owing to his unknowing about suffering’s origin he embarks upon formations that, being subordinated to craving, are actually the cause of suffering, imagining them to be the cause of pleasure. And owing to his unknowing about cessation and the path, he misperceives the cessation of suffering to be in some particular destiny [such as the Brahmā-world] that is not in fact cessation; he misperceives the path to cessation, believing it to consist in sacrifices, mortification for immortality, etc., which are not in fact the path to cessation; and so while aspiring to the cessation of suffering, he embarks upon </phrase><literal>[607|549]</literal><phrase>the three kinds of formations in the form of sacrifices, mortification for immortality, and so on.</phrase></para></formalpara><formalpara label="XVII.63" xml:id="XVII.63"><title>§63</title><para><phrase>Furthermore, his non-abandonment of that ignorance about the four truths in particular prevents him from recognizing as suffering the kind of suffering called the fruit of merit, which is fraught with the many dangers beginning with birth, ageing, disease and death, and so he embarks upon the formation of merit classed as bodily, verbal, and mental formations, in order to attain that [kind of suffering], like one desiring celestial nymphs [who jumps over] a cliff. Also, not seeing how that fruit of merit reckoned as pleasure eventually breeds great distress owing to the suffering in its change and that it gives little satisfaction, he embarks upon the formation of merit of the kinds already stated, which is the condition for that very [suffering in change], like a moth that falls into a lamp’s flame, and like the man who wants the drop of honey and licks the honey-smeared knife-edge. Also, not seeing the danger in the indulgence of sense desires, etc., with its results, [wrongly] perceiving pleasure and overcome by defilements, he embarks upon the formation of demerit that occurs in the three doors [of kamma], like a child who plays with filth, and like a man who wants to die and eats poison. Also, unaware of the suffering due to formations and the suffering-in-change [inherent] in kamma-results in the immaterial sphere, owing to the perversion of [wrongly perceiving them as] eternal, etc., he embarks upon the formation of the imperturbable which is a mental formation, like one who has lost his way and takes the road to a goblin city.</phrase></para></formalpara><formalpara label="XVII.64" xml:id="XVII.64"><title>§64</title><para><phrase>So formations exist only when ignorance exists, </phrase><varname>(532)</varname><phrase> not when it does not; and that is how it can be known that these formations have ignorance as their condition.</phrase></para><para><phrase>This is said too: “Not knowing, bhikkhus, in ignorance, he forms the formation of merit, forms the formation of demerit, forms the formation of the imperturbable.

But in the Dispensation, in such passages as “Those states that are produced from a cause” (</phrase><phrase><citation>Vin</citation><phrase> I 40</phrase></phrase><phrase>), it is a reason (</phrase><emphasis>kāraṇa</emphasis><phrase>); and in such passages as “Three profitable [root-] causes, three unprofitable [root-]causes” (</phrase><phrase><citation>Dhs</citation><phrase> §1053</phrase></phrase><phrase>), it is a root (</phrase><emphasis>mūla</emphasis><phrase>) that is called a cause.

What is meant is: when a state is indispensable to another state’s presence or arising, the former is a condition for the latter. But as to characteristic, a condition has the characteristic of assisting; for any given state </phrase><varname>(533)</varname><phrase> that assists the presence or arising of a given state is called the latter’s condition. The words condition, cause, reason, source, originator, producer, etc., are one in meaning though different in the letter. So, since it is a cause in the sense of a root, and a condition in the sense of assistance, briefly a state that is assistantial in the sense of a root is a [root-]cause condition.</phrase></para></formalpara><formalpara label="XVII.69" xml:id="XVII.69"><title>§69</title><para><phrase>The intention of [some] teachers is that it establishes the profitable, etc., state in what is profitable, etc., as paddy seeds, etc., do for paddy, etc., and as the colour of gems, etc., do for the lustre of gems, and so on.</phrase><footnote label="XVII.n10" xml:id="XVII.n10"><para><phrase>“This refers to the teacher Revata” (</phrase><phrase><citation>Vism-mhṭ</citation><phrase> 582</phrase></phrase><phrase>).</phrase></para></footnote><phrase> But if that is so, then [it follows that] the state of root-cause condition does not apply to the kinds of materiality originated by it, for it does not establish any profitableness, etc., in them. Nevertheless, it is a condition for them, for this is said: “Root-causes are a condition, as root-cause condition, for the states associated with a root-cause and for the kinds of materiality originated thereby” (</phrase><phrase><citation>Paṭṭh</citation><phrase> I 1</phrase></phrase><phrase>). Again, the indeterminateness of root-causeless consciousness is established without it. And the profitableness, etc., of those with root-cause is bound up with wise attention, etc., not with the associated root-causes. And if the profitableness, etc., resided in the associated root-causes as an individual essence, then either the non-greed bound up with the root-cause in the associated states would be only profitable or it would be only indeterminate; but since it can be both, profitableness, etc., in the root-causes must still be sought for, just as in the associated states [such as wise attention, and so on].</phrase></para></formalpara><formalpara label="XVII.70" xml:id="XVII.70"><title>§70</title><para><phrase>But when the root-causes’ sense of root is taken as establishing stableness, rather than as establishing profitableness, etc., there is no contradiction.

Clinging (</phrase><emphasis>upādāna</emphasis><phrase>) is firm grasping; for here the prefix </phrase><emphasis>upa</emphasis><phrase> has the sense of firmness, as in </phrase><emphasis>upāyāsa</emphasis><phrase> (great misery—see </phrase><link linkend="XVII.48">§48</link><phrase>) and </phrase><emphasis>upakuṭṭha</emphasis><phrase> (great pox),</phrase><footnote label="XVII.n41" xml:id="XVII.n41"><para><emphasis>Upakuṭṭha—</emphasis><phrase>“great pox” or “great leprosy”: not in PED; see </phrase><emphasis>kuṭṭha.</emphasis></para></footnote><phrase> and so on.

Likewise, they indoctrinate by means of that, thus that is doctrine; they cling by means of that, thus that is clinging. What do they indoctrinate with? What do they cling to? Self. The clinging to doctrines of self is self-doctrine clinging. Or by means of that they cling to a self that is a mere doctrine of self; thus that is self-doctrine clinging.

That which in the case of sense desires is lust for sense desires, greed for sense desires, delight in sense desires, craving for sense desires, fever of sense desires, infatuation with sense desires, committal to sense desires: that is called sense-desire clinging” (</phrase><phrase><citation>Dhs</citation><phrase> §1214</phrase></phrase><phrase>). “Firmness of craving” is a name for the subsequent craving itself, which has become firm by the influence of previous craving, which acts as its decisive-support condition. But some have said: Craving is the aspiring to an object that one has not yet reached, like a thief’s stretching out his hand in the dark; clinging is the grasping of an object that one has reached, like the thief’s grasping his objective. These states oppose fewness of wishes and contentment and so they are the roots of the suffering due to seeking and guarding (see </phrase><phrase><citation>D</citation><phrase> II 58f.</phrase></phrase><phrase>). The remaining three kinds of clinging are in brief simply [false] view.</phrase></para></formalpara><formalpara label="XVII.243" xml:id="XVII.243"><title>§243</title><para><phrase>In detail, however, sense-desire clinging is the firm state of the craving described above as of one-hundred-and-eight kinds with respect to visible data and so on. [False-] view clinging is the ten-based wrong view, according as it is said: “Herein what is [false-] view clinging? There is no giving, no offering, … [no good and virtuous ascetics and brahmans who have themselves] realized by direct-knowledge and declare this world and the other world: such view as this … such perverse assumption is called [false-]view clinging” (</phrase><phrase><citation>Vibh</citation><phrase> 375</phrase></phrase><phrase>; </phrase><phrase><citation>Dhs</citation><phrase> §1215</phrase></phrase><phrase>). Rules-and-vows clinging is the adherence [to the view that] purification comes through rules and vows, according as it is said: “Herein, what is rules-and-vows clinging? … That purification comes through a rite, that purification comes through a ritual, </phrase><varname>(570)</varname><phrase> that purification comes through a rite and ritual: such view as this … such perverse assumption is called rules-and-vows clinging” (</phrase><phrase><citation>Dhs</citation><phrase> §1216</phrase></phrase><phrase>). Self-doctrine clinging is the twenty-based [false] view of individuality, according as it is said: “Herein, what is self-doctrine clinging? Here the untaught ordinary man … untrained in good men’s Dhamma, sees materiality as self … such perverse assumption is called self-doctrine clinging” (</phrase><phrase><citation>Dhs</citation><phrase> §1217</phrase></phrase><phrase>).

Herein, order of arising of </phrase><literal>[650|592]</literal><phrase>defilements is not meant literally because there is no first arising of defilements in the beginningless round of rebirths. But in a relative sense it is this: usually in a single becoming the misinterpretation of (insistence on) eternity and annihilation are preceded by the assumption of a self. After that, when a man assumes that this self is eternal, rules-and-vows clinging arises in him for the purpose of purifying the self. And when a man assumes that it breaks up, thus disregarding the next world, sense-desire clinging arises in him. So self-doctrine clinging arises first, and after that, [false-] view clinging, and rules-and-vows clinging or sense-desire clinging. This, then, is their order of arising in one becoming.</phrase></para></formalpara><formalpara label="XVII.245" xml:id="XVII.245"><title>§245</title><para><phrase>And here [false-] view clinging, etc., are abandoned first because they are eliminated by the path of stream-entry.

One possessed of sense-desire clinging is much given to display and ceremony (see </phrase><phrase><citation>M</citation><phrase> I 265</phrase></phrase><phrase>) for the purpose of attaining sense desires.

So this Wheel of Becoming should also be known accordingly “as to the kinds of method.”</phrase><footnote label="XVII.n48" xml:id="XVII.n48"><para><phrase>The dependent origination, or structure of conditions, appears as a flexible formula with the intention of describing the ordinary human situation of a man in his world (or indeed any conscious event where ignorance and craving have not entirely ceased). That situation is always complex, since it is implicit that consciousness with no object, or being (</phrase><emphasis>bhava—</emphasis><phrase>becoming, or however rendered) without consciousness (of it), is impossible except as an artificial abstraction. The dependent origination, being designed to portray the essentials of that situation in the limited dimensions of words and using only elements recognizable in experience, is not a logical proposition (Descartes’ </phrase><emphasis>cogito </emphasis><phrase>is not a logical proposition). Nor is it a temporal cause-and-effect chain: each member has to be examined as to its nature in order to determine what its relations to the others are (e.g. whether successive in time or conascent, positive or negative, etc., etc.). A purely cause-and-effect chain would not represent the pattern of a situation that is always complex, always subjective-objective, static-dynamic, positive-negative, and so on. Again, there is no evidence of any historical development in the various forms given </phrase><emphasis>within the limit of the Sutta Piṭaka </emphasis><phrase>(leaving aside the Paṭisambhidāmagga), and historical treatment within that particular limit is likely to mislead, if it is hypothesis with no foundation.</phrase></para><para><phrase>Parallels with European thought have been avoided in this translation. But perhaps an exception can be made here, with due caution, in the case of Descartes. The revolution in European thought started by his formula </phrase><emphasis>cogito ergo sum </emphasis><phrase>(“I think, therefore I am”) is not yet ended. Now, it will perhaps not escape notice that the two elements, “I think” and “I am,” in what is not a logical proposition parallel to some extent the two members of the dependent origination, consciousness and being (becoming). In other words, consciousness activated by craving and clinging as the dynamic factory, guided and blinkered by ignorance (“I think” or “consciousness with the conceit ‘I am’”), conditions being (“therefore I am”) in a complex relationship with other factors relating subject and object (not accounted for by Descartes). The parallel should not be pushed too far. In fact it is only introduced because in Europe the dependent origination seems to be very largely misunderstood with many strange interpretations placed upon it, and because the </phrase><emphasis>cogito </emphasis><phrase>does seem to offer some sort of reasonable approach. In this work, for convenience because of the special importance attached here to the aspect of the death-rebirth link, the dependent origination is considered from only one standpoint, namely, as applicable to a period embracing a minimum of three lives. But this is not the only application. With suitable modifications it is also used in the Vibhaṅga to describe the structure of the complex in each one of the 89 single type-consciousnesses laid down in the </phrase><emphasis>Dhammasaṅgaṇī</emphasis><phrase>; and Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa says: “This structure of conditions is present not only in (a continuity period consisting of) multiple consciousnesses but also in each single consciousness as well” (</phrase><phrase><citation>Vibh-a</citation><phrase> 199–200</phrase></phrase><phrase>). Also the Paṭisambhidāmagga gives five expositions, four describing dependent origination in one life, the fifth being made to present a special inductive generalization to extend what is observable in this life (the fact that consciousness is always preceded by consciousness, cf. this Ch. §83f.—i.e. that it always has a past and is inconceivable without one) back beyond birth, and (since craving and ignorance ensure its expected continuance) on after death. There are, besides, various other, differing applications indicated by the variant forms given in the suttas themselves.</phrase></para></footnote></para></formalpara><formalpara label="XVII.310" xml:id="XVII.310"><title>§310</title><para><literal>[665|607]</literal><phrase>(a) Herein, the non-interruption of the continuity in this way, “With ignorance as condition there are formations; with formations as condition, consciousness,” just like a seed’s reaching the state of a tree through the state of the shoot, etc., is called the “method of identity.” One who sees this rightly abandons the annihilation view by understanding the unbrokenness of the continuity that occurs through the linking of cause and fruit.

(11)–(13) The three beginning with ‘</phrase><emphasis>contemplation of the signless</emphasis><phrase>’ are the same as the three beginning with contemplation of impermanence. (11) ‘</phrase><emphasis>The sign</emphasis><phrase>’ is the mere appearance of formations as if graspable entities, which is due to the individualization of particular functions and which, owing to perception of unity in continuity and in mass, is assumed to be temporarily enduring or permanent. (12) ‘</phrase><emphasis>Desire</emphasis><phrase>’ is longing for pleasure, or it is desire consisting in greed, and so on; it means inclinationto formations owing to craving. (13) ‘</phrase><emphasis>Misinterpreting</emphasis><phrase>’ is misinterpreting as self. It is owing to their opposing the ‘</phrase><emphasis>sign</emphasis><phrase>,’ etc., that the contemplations of impermanence, etc., are called by the names of ‘signless,’ etc.; so they should be regarded as opposed to the apprehension of a sign, etc., just as they are to the perception of permanence, and so on. (14) Insight that occurs by knowing an object consisting of a visible datum, etc., and by seeing the dissolution of the consciousness that had that visible datum, etc., as its object, and by apprehending voidness through the dissolution thus, ‘Only formations dissolve, there is nothing beyond the death of formations,’ is the higher understanding, and that is insight into states, thus it is ‘</phrase><emphasis>insight into states that is higher understanding</emphasis><phrase>’; by its means he abandons the view accompanied by craving that is the misinterpretation occurring as grasping at a permanent core, and so on. (15) ‘</phrase><emphasis>Correct knowledge and vision</emphasis><phrase>’ is a term for the seeing of mentality-materiality with its conditions; by its means he abandons the ‘</phrase><emphasis>misinterpreting due to confusion</emphasis><phrase>’ that begins thus, ‘Was I in the past?’ (</phrase><phrase><citation>M</citation><phrase> I 8</phrase></phrase><phrase>) and that begins thus, ‘Thus the world is created by an Overlord’ (?). (16) The knowledge consisting in the seeing of danger in all kinds of becomings, etc., which has arisen owing to the appearance of terror is ‘</phrase><emphasis>contemplation of danger</emphasis><phrase>’; by its means he abandons the craving occurring as ‘</phrase><emphasis>misinterpreting due to reliance</emphasis><phrase>’ because he does not see any reliance or support. (17) The knowledge of reflection that is the means to deliverance from formations is ‘</phrase><emphasis>contemplation of reflection</emphasis><phrase>’; by its means he abandons the ignorance that is ‘</phrase><emphasis>non-reflection</emphasis><phrase>’ on impermanence, etc., and is opposed to reflection on them. (18) Equanimity about formations and conformity knowledge are ‘</phrase><emphasis>contemplation of turning away</emphasis><phrase>’; for owing to it the mind retreats and recoils from all formations, like a water drop on a lotus leaf, so by its means he abandons the ‘</phrase><emphasis>misinterpretation due to bondage</emphasis><phrase>,’ which is the occurrence of the defilements consisting of the fetters of sense desire, and so on.

For when material and immaterial states have arisen mutually steadying each other, [mentality and materiality, for example,] then, owing to misinterpreting that as a unity, compactness of mass is assumed through failure to subject formations to pressure. And likewise compactness of function is assumed when, although definite differences exist in such and such states’ functions, they are taken as one. And likewise compactness of object is assumed when, although differences exist in the ways in which states that take objects make them their objects, those objects are taken as one. But when they are seen after resolving them by means of knowledge into these elements, they disintegrate like froth subjected to compression by the hand.

This refers to the way in which insight arrives [at the path] and is expressed literally.</phrase></para></formalpara><formalpara label="XXI.73" xml:id="XXI.73"><title>§73</title><para><phrase>However, in the Paṭisambhidā insight knowledge is expressed as follows: (i) It is expressed firstly as the void liberation by its liberating from misinterpreting [formations]: “Knowledge of contemplation of impermanence is the void liberation since it liberates from interpreting [them] as permanent; knowledge of contemplation of pain is the void liberation since it liberates from interpreting </phrase><literal>[745|687]</literal><phrase>[them] as pleasant; knowledge of contemplation of not-self is the void liberation since it liberates from interpreting [them] as self” (</phrase><phrase><citation>Paṭis</citation><phrase> II 67</phrase></phrase><phrase>). (ii) Then it is expressed as the signless liberation by liberating from signs: “Knowledge of contemplation of impermanence is the signless liberation since it liberates from the sign [of formations] as permanent; knowledge of contemplation of pain is the signless liberation since it liberates from the sign [of formations] as pleasant; knowledge of contemplation of not-self is the signless liberation since it liberates from the sign [of formations] as self” (</phrase><phrase><citation>Paṭis</citation><phrase> II 68</phrase></phrase><phrase>). </phrase><varname>(659)</varname><phrase> (iii) Lastly it is expressed as the desireless liberation by its liberating from desire: “Knowledge of contemplation of impermanence is the desireless liberation since it liberates from desire [for formations] as permanent; knowledge of contemplation of pain is the desireless liberation since it liberates from the desire [for them] as pleasant; knowledge of contemplation of not-self is the desireless liberation since it liberates from the desire [for them] as self” (</phrase><phrase><citation>Paṭis</citation><phrase> II 68</phrase></phrase><phrase>). But although stated in this way, insight knowledge is not literally signless because there is no abandoning of the sign of formations [as formed, here, as distinct from their sign as impermanent and so on]. It is however literally void and desireless. And it is at the moment of the noble path that the liberation is distinguished, and that is done according to insight knowledge’s way of arrival at the path.</phrase><footnote label="XXI.n35" xml:id="XXI.n35"><para><phrase>“Why is signless insight unable to give its own name to the path when it has come to the point of arrival at the path? Of course, signless insight is mentioned in the suttas thus, ‘Develop the signless and get rid of the inherent tendency to conceit’ (</phrase><phrase><citation>Sn</citation><phrase> 342</phrase></phrase><phrase>). Nevertheless, though it eliminates the signs of permanence, of lastingness, and of self, it still possesses a sign itself and is occupied with states that possess a sign. Again, the Abhidhamma is the teaching in the ultimate sense, and in the ultimate sense the cause of a signless path is wanting. For the signless liberation is stated in accordance with the contemplation of impermanence, and in that the faith faculty predominates. But the faith faculty is not represented by any one of the factors of the path. And so it cannot give its name to the path since it forms no part of it. In the case of the other two, the desireless liberation is due to the contemplation of pain, and the void liberation is due to the contemplation of not-self. Now the concentration faculty predominates in the desireless liberation and the understanding faculty in the void liberation. So since these are factors of the path as well, they can give their own names to the path; but there is no signless path because the factor is wanting. So some say. But there are others who say that there is a signless path, and that although it does not get its name from the way insight arrives at it, still it gets its name from a special quality of its own and from its object. In their opinion the desireless and void paths should also get their names from special qualities of their own and from their objects too. That is wrong. Why? Because the path gets its names for two reasons, that is, because of its own nature and because of what it opposes—the meaning is, because of its individual essence and because of what it is contrary to. For the desireless path is free from desire due to greed, etc., and the void path is free from greed too, so they both get their names from their individual essence. Similarly, the desireless path is the contrary of desire and the void path is the contrary of misinterpretation as self, so they get their names from what they oppose. On the other hand, the signless path gets its name only from its own nature owing to the non-existence in it of the signs of greed, etc., or of the signs of permanence, etc., but not owing to what it opposes. For it does not oppose the contemplation of impermanence, which has as its object the sign of formations [as formed], but remains in agreement with it. So a signless path is altogether inadmissible by the Abhidhamma method. This is why it is said, ‘This refers to the way in which insight arrives at the path and is expressed in the literal sense’ (§72).</phrase></para><para><phrase>“However, by the Suttanta method a signless path is admissible. For according to that, in whatever way insight leading to emergence (see §83) effects its comprehending it still leads on to emergence of the path, and when it is at the point of arrival it gives its own name to the path accordingly—when emerging owing to comprehension as impermanent the path is signless, when emerging owing to comprehension as painful it is desireless, and when emerging owing to comprehension as not-self it is void. Taking this as a sutta commentary, therefore, three liberations are differentiated here. But in the Paṭisambhidā the deliverance from misinterpreting, from the sign and from desire, are taken respectively as the arrival of the three kinds of comprehension at that deliverance, and what is described is a corresponding state of void liberation, etc., respectively in the paths that follow upon that deliverance. There is no question of treating that literally, which is why he said, ‘However, in the Paṭisambhidā insight knowledge’ and so on” (</phrase><phrase><citation>Vism-mhṭ</citation><phrase> 846–848</phrase></phrase><phrase>).</phrase></para></footnote><phrase> That, it </phrase><literal>[746|688]</literal><phrase>should be understood, is why only two liberations are stated [in the Abhidhamma], namely, the desireless and the void.</phrase></para><para><phrase>This, firstly, is the treatise on the liberations here.</phrase></para></formalpara></section><section><title><phrase>The Seven Kinds of Noble Persons</phrase></title><formalpara label="XXI.74" xml:id="XXI.74"><title>§74</title><para><phrase>It was said above, “It becomes a condition for the classification of noble persons into seven kinds.” (</phrase><link linkend="XXI.66">§66</link><phrase>) Herein, there are firstly these seven kinds of noble person: (1) the faith devotee, (2) one liberated by faith, (3) the body witness, (4) the both-ways liberated, (5) the Dhamma devotee, (6) one attained to vision, and (7) one liberated by understanding.
