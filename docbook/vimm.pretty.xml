But he fell ill and by the end of 1939 the Second World War was already three months old. All hope of publishing the revised edition of the Original Draft Translation during the war had to be given up. With the end of the war, however, conditions were even less favourable. Meanwhile, though the Venerable Soma Thera wished to complete the revision, and await a favourable occasion to publish it, other work he had undertaken prevented him from doing so. Further, asthma robbed him of much, of his time. Thus the work he intended to do on the </phrase>
        <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
        <phrase> translation had to be postponed each time he took it up.</phrase>

      <para>
        <phrase>When he passed away many venerable theras and </phrase>
        <emphasis>dāyakas</emphasis>
        <phrase> were much interested in publishing, at least, the Original Draft Translation as it was, and they requested me to prepare it for publication. Knowing my own limitations, I was at first rather disinclined to undertake this work, but later acceded to their earnest request for the following reasons.</phrase>
      </para>
      <para>
        <phrase>The Venerable Soma Thera had originally wished to have the English translation of the </phrase>
        <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
        <phrase> (The Path of Freedom) revised and published some day. But later, seeing difficulties, he modified the idea and was even content with merely revising the Draft Translation, leaving the publication itself to some future time. He said that the important thing, the Draft Translation, had been done, and that if people felt that they needed it they would see to its publication.</phrase>
      </para>
      <para>
        <phrase>It was a work that had inspired both the Venerable Soma Thera and me, and there were many who welcomed its publication.</phrase>
      </para>
      <para>
        <phrase>Dr. D. Roland D. Weerasuria of Balcombe House, Balcombe Place, Colombo, invited the Venerable Soma Thera sometime in 1959 to write an abridged version of the </phrase>
        <emphasis>Visuddhimagga</emphasis>
        <phrase> as he felt that such an edition would supply a long felt want. But shortly after he began writing it death intervened. Dr. Weerasuria then requested the Venerable Ñāṇamoli Thera to take up the work which, after some hesitation, he agreed to finish within a year. But he, too, passed away within a week. Sometime after this Dr. Weerasuria, having seen the Original Draft Translation of the </phrase>
        <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
        <phrase>, was keen on its publication.</phrase>
      </para>
      <para>
        <phrase>This was a fitting occasion to pay a tribute to the memory of the two senior co-translators of the </phrase>

        <phrase> And finally the urgent personal need to keep myself immersed in the </phrase>
        <emphasis>Dhamma</emphasis>
        <phrase> throughout the waking hours during this period of stress prompted me to take up the work.</phrase>
      </para>
      <para>
        <phrase>From the above it will be seen that this work was taken up due to sheer force of circumstances and not because of any special qualification on my part. Therefore, perhaps, some things stated here could have been said in other and better ways. Inexpert as I am in scholarly pursuits there is bound to be many a lack in my portion of this work and so I ask the reader to bear with me should he detect any errors of commission or omission here.</phrase>
      </para>
      <para>
        <phrase>In preparing this work for printing I have made a few alterations in the rendering of certain terms and passages, as they appeared in the Original Draft Translation, in accordance with notes and instructions left by the Venerable Soma Thera. The lacunae in the Draft Translation were filled, as far as possible, with the help of the word for word translation in consultation with Soma Thera’s notes. All the longer Pali quotations in the footnotes, except a few from the </phrase>
        <emphasis>Visuddhimagga</emphasis>
        <phrase> and some from the </phrase>
        <emphasis>Dhammasaṅgani</emphasis>
        <phrase> etc., were inserted by me. They are given in full mainly with the idea of helping the general reader conversant with the Pali but to whom reference books are not easily accessible. By this attempt of mine if but just a few readers happen to be benefitted, to any extent, I should consider myself amply rewarded.</phrase>

        <phrase>Since the Introduction had already been sent to the Printers by the time the ‘Encyclopaedia of Buddhism’ (1961 Government of Ceylon, Fascicule A-Aca) was </phrase>
        <phrase>out, the following is included here. In his article, Abhidharma Literature, Dr. Kōgen Mizuno makes three statements on page 78 of the Encyclopaedia regarding the </phrase>
        <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>

        <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
        <phrase> (along with the </phrase>

        <phrase> of the </phrase>
        <emphasis>Suttanipāta</emphasis>
        <phrase> etc.) “probably belonged to the Abhayagiri sect and not to the Mahāvihāra sect” (paragraph B continued from the previous page); (2) that “He (i. e., the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera) evidently studied the </phrase>
        <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
        <phrase>, which was a manual of the Abhayagirivihāra sect” (paragraph c); and (3) “That the </phrase>
        <emphasis>Vimuttimagga,</emphasis>
        <phrase> was Upatissa’s work and belonged to the Abhayagirivihāra sect is mentioned in the ṭikā (sub-commentary, i.e., Dhammapāla’s Paramatthamañjūsā) of the </phrase>
        <emphasis>Visuddhimagga</emphasis>
        <phrase>” (paragraph c).</phrase>
      </para>
      <para>
        <phrase>The first statement, (1) above, says that the </phrase>
        <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
        <phrase> “probably belonged to the Abhayagiri sect”, while the second, (2) above, says “</phrase>
        <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
        <phrase>, which was a manuel of the Abhayagirivihāra sect”. How, precisely, did probability in paragraph b became certainty in paragraph c? As for the third statement, (3) above, the </phrase>
        <emphasis>Paramatthamañjūsā</emphasis>
        <phrase> does not say that the </phrase>

      <phrase>It is fitting to record here the life and work of the Venerable Soma Mahā Thera, for, but for his indomitable energy and earnestness this work would not have been undertaken, persisted in, and brought to a conclusion in just four months. Whenever any difficulty arose it was to him that the others turned. When we were tempted to give up the work on encountering really hard patches, he was always ready with encouragement and with a way out of the difficulty. He loved to work hard, and half-hearted effort was unknown to him. Not infrequently he used to say, “Better wear out than rust out”.</phrase>

    <para>
      <phrase>Soma Mahā Thera was born on December 23,1898, in Kotahena, Colombo, and passed away at Vajirārāma, Bambalapitiya, Colombo, Tuesday, February 23, 1960. His father was Emmanuel Marian Perera Pulle, and his mother, Theresa Rodrigo Babapulle. His name was Victor Emmanuel Perera Pulle. He received his education at St. Benedict’s College, Kotahena.</phrase>

      <phrase>Once at the age of eleven, when he was told by his teacher that God made man, he promptly asked him, “Who made God?”. The teacher, apparently unused to this sort of question from his pupils, snapped back, “Do not question the antecedents of God”. However, this incident pleased neither the teacher nor the pupil. He began to read and think for himself. One day his mother gave him one rupee as pocket-money, and Victor walked about three miles to a bookshop in the Fort, Colombo, looking out for a book priced at one rupee or less, as that was all he had. Finding an English translation of the Dhammapada being sold for a rupee he quickly bought and read it again and again. This was his introduction to the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Buddhadhamma</emphasis>
      <phrase>. From that day on he </phrase>
      <literal>[11|x]</literal>
      <phrase> eagerly attended lectures and sermons on the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Dhamma</emphasis>
      <phrase>, the while reading what literature came his way on philosophy, art, archaeology, history—in fact anything that would add to his knowledge. And thus he moved further and further away from the faith of his fathers. During these years, as his mother objected to his reading late into the night, he would, after she had gone to sleep, begin reading by candle light under the bed. Sometimes he found that when he had finished reading it was already day. Such was his thirst for knowledge.</phrase>

      <phrase>Sometime in 1920 he had met Mr. W. Joseph Soysa, one of the founder- members of the Servants of the Buddha, the well-known association which has its headquarters at Lauries Road, Bambalapitiya, and of which the Venerable Kassapa Thera is the founder-patron. After being actively engaged for sometime in the publication of the “Blessing” which was edited by the then president of the association, Dr. Cassius A. Pereira, he, along with Mr. Soysa, joined the Colombo Buddhist Union in the early twenties, and presented a large collection of books to the Union library.

      <phrase>. A deep understanding of human nature and the human problem of suffering had mellowed him and bred in him, in an unusual degree, qualities of tolerance, patience, restraint and sympathy with fellow-beings. Opposition and frustration left in him no sense of defeat or bitterness. He was the working bee in the Master’s hive and, in His service, the very juice of the bitter thyme turned into honey at his touch. No wonder that, in the Augustan age of Buddhist renascence in Ceylon, Soma Thera was considered to represent the fine flower of Buddhist culture. He shed its fragrance wherever he moved. As scholar, preacher, organiser, monk and friend it may be aptly said of him: “</phrase>

      <phrase> ‘These sterling qualities of Soma Thera were happily blended in a character in which humility and service formed the keynote. He never spared himself. He gave till it hurt. He gave UNTO THIS LAST—unto death. Overwork, fatigue, were the proximate causes of the dire malady which struck down this mighty oak of the </phrase>

      <phrase>‘To those of us who knew him and enjoyed his friendship and affection for nearly four decades both as the dashing young layman Victor E. P. Pulle, and as a monk of blessed memory, Soma Thera presents a remarkable character study. The child was the father of the man, Thera. Yet in his twenties, he was a rebel from the faith of his fathers and questing for the knowledge of the truth. In the 1930’s, still hot on the pursuit, he was the leader of a band of young men who formed the Fort Study Circle under the Presidency of Mr. J. Tyagarajah, with Dr. L. A. (now Sir Lalita) Rajapakse and the late Mr. R. Nadarajah as Vice-Presidents.</phrase>

      <phrase> combined in himself such a vast amalgam of knowledge. Literary and economic studies, however, could not satisfy his ardent mind and he joined the Sangha.

      <phrase> and impulsiveness of the layman turned into serene calm. The combative debater of yesteryear became the sedate teacher and friendly adviser. The glint of battle which, earlier rose to his eyes when argument waxed high grew into sparks of sympathy and compassion. The chiselled square jaws which hurled challenge softened their contours. Above all, the terrific right fist which characteristically swung menacingly in debate would swing no more. It was obvious even to us his old boon companions to whom he still accorded the privilege of “ragging” him once in a way, that this great pioneer and savant, by a terrific ordeal of trial and error, had at last subdued himself and that he had not only found the Middle Path but had established himself so firmly in it that he was a fitting exemplar of his Master’s Way of Life.</phrase>

      <phrase>” is perfectly applicable. In his Study Circle days, he had a massive style. The exposition and argument would at times be obscured by the weight of movement. He used his pen as a tomahawk. When Carthage had to be destroyed, he made no bones about it but went and destroyed. As a Thera, the old asperity and venom disappeared and the style assumed a precision, clarity, mellowness and gentle movement which reflected the repose and. sureness of his own mind.

Later I was happy to find that the Buddha taught that it was not easy to find a being, who, during the vast period of time covered in the process of birth and death, and birth again and death, had not, at one time or another, been a mother, a father, a brother, a sister, a son, a daughter. The Blessed One then asks the question, “What is the reason for this”? and himself answers: “Not to be known is the </phrase>

Because of that you should turn away from the formations (</phrase>

      <phrase>In the late twenties, Victor and I had heard from the late Mr. Wong Mow Lam, the Chinese scholar, who was in Ceylon for sometime, that there were great possibilities for spreading the </phrase>

      <phrase> in his country and that there was much that could be translated from the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Mahāyāna</emphasis>
      <phrase> literature of China. So when we went to Burma in 1934, remembering the words of our scholar friend, we decided after careful thought to go to the Far East and return later to Burma for ordination. We began our journey to China by way of Kawkerik, over the misty Dawna Mountains and across the border for four days on foot to Raehaeng in Thailand, and thence by bus, river boat and train through Svankaloke (Svargaloka—heaven world), Pisaloke (Viṣṇuloka — Viṣṇu’s world), we arrived in Krum Teb (Deva Nagara — the city of the gods) which is Bangkok. Then again, after travelling by train to Penang, and by ship to Singapore and Hong Kong, we arrived in Shanghai. Finding there no facilities for study we proceeded to Tokyo. There we met Prof. Nichiki Kimura of Rissho University, who invited us to attend his English lectures on </phrase>
      <emphasis>Mahāyāna</emphasis>
      <phrase>. Towards the end of 1935, through his good offices, we were invited to Jozaiji, the Nichiren temple in Kawatana-Machi, Nagasaki-ken. The head of that temple, the Rev. N. R. M. Ehara, had been a lecturer at Rissho for sometime. He was the perfect host—a most understanding, patient, pleasant, witty character with abundant laughter, and he was young. He did everything within his power to make our stay as comfortable as possible.</phrase>

      <phrase> When we arrived at Kawatana-Machi, Jozaiji was being rebuilt. By the end of April, the building operations over, our host set apart the new guesthouse for our use and called it the Lion Hall, “in honour”, as he said, “of the Lion Isle, the home of my friends”. We spent a most pleasant and fruitful year in our Lion Hall, for, it was here that the whole of the </phrase>

      <phrase> (the Chinese translation of the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>

Nyāṇatiloka Mahā Thera was in Japan during the years that followed the First World War, he tried, but failed, to persuade any Japanese scholar to undertake this translation. So when we sent him a copy of our translation he heartily welcomed it. The word for word translation the draft translation, copying, cyclostyling, binding, packing for the post, were all done by the three of us and that during the brief space of four months. Besides, the section on virtue had to be cyclostyled thrice before Victor was satisfied with it.</phrase>

      <phrase>, and that originally it was supposed to have been written in Pali in Ceylon by a Sinhalese Thera. With one voice both of us exclaimed that we were ready to begin translating it that very instant,—of course, with his help. And our friend, with his great big ringing laughter, readily agreed. And we immediately translated the first few pages though he had much to do, it being very close to </phrase>

There, walking along in Moon Plains once, he was absorbed in the beauty of a waterfall. He used to watch the water rushing down in a silver streak, and very often the asthma left him on those occasions or he forgot it. This tiresome friend, Asthma, has a peculiar trait. He wants attention. And, sometimes, if no attention is paid to him, he sharply retorts in return by paying no attention. These were the times when Soma Thera would say, “I am thoroughly fit.

He also conducted a Pali class, which was well attended. In November that year the Mission returned to Hong Kong where, too, Soma Thera addressed various groups of Buddhists. Arriving in Singapore in January 1947, the mission had to wait two months for a boat. Meanwhile Soma Thera delivered sermons and lectures to large gatherings both in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. The Mission returned to Ceylon in March that year. Soma Thera returned to the Island Hermitage at the end of 1948 and remained there till 1954. After his return from China, on his initiative, two important Buddhist associations in Colombo, The Sāsanādhāra Kāntā Samitiya and The Banks’ Asoka Society, were formed in 1950 and 1956 respectively.

Finding that the long stay at the Island Hermitage had worsened his asthma and seeing the advantage of being with the Venerable Paelāēnē Siri Vajirañāṇa Mahā Nāyaka Thera at Vajirārāma with its well equipped library, Soma Thera came to reside once more at Vajirārāma. Both the Mahā Nāyaka Thera and Soma Thera were happy to meet; for, as far back as 1919, the former had inspired the latter by his great knowledge, understanding, and kindness. Soma Thera’s regard and respect for him kept on increasing during the years. They used to converse on the </phrase>

My first impression was of a remarkably earnest man who was determined to seek and find out the Truth.

      <phrase>…. As a member of the Order he became a changed man. I noticed a strength of character and calmness of demeanour in everything he said and wrote.

Occasionally the eye would flash and I could see the old time fighter but there was an unmistakable sense of toleration of others and a remarkable kindliness in everything he said. The Venerable Soma Mahā Thera was very well known to English speaking audiences in the Island. Many may remember his thoughtful talks over Radio Ceylon. I am aware how deeply he was respected by Buddhist students in schools all over the island….To me his translation, edition and notes of the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta</emphasis>
      <phrase> is characteristic of the man. He was one who wanted to practise the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Dhamma</emphasis>
      <phrase>, and the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta</emphasis>
      <phrase> was to him ‘the one way for the ending of unhappiness’. I can see his mind in his introductory notes and his interpretations of the text. The Venerable Soma Thera’s edition of the </phrase>

      <phrase> is a part of his own life because he was one who wanted to practise the </phrase>

      <phrase>. I miss him very much as a friend but those who knew him have no cause to grieve for a life that had been so nobly spent, He had acquitted himself heroically in all things he did to the….end Alert and intensely alive in the search and practice of the Truth, it is of these that the Buddha has said that ‘those who are heedful do not die’. His life is an example to all those who knew him, that there is nothing nobler for a Buddhist than to live the life that the Buddha has preached, to walk the way He had walked and to follow Him on the Noble Quest.

It is also fitting to record here the help readily given by the late Mr. Sāgara Palansuriya and Mr. K. M. W. Kuruppu during this difficult period. But both as layman and as monk his attitude to those who were opposed to him, and who later became hostile, was one of kindness and understanding.

On his return to Ceylon in early 1957, Soma Thera was invited by the German Dharmadūta Society to lead the first Buddhist Mission to Germany in June that year, the other members being Vinīta Thera, Mr. W Joseph Soysa and myself. But though he underwent a serious operation just two weeks before the mission was due to leave, he insisted on not altering the travel arrangements. Actually he went on board ship direct from the hospital. The wound had not healed completely then, and the dressing had to be continued for another five weeks. At the end of this period he could not move his left arm. It was after a further three months’ treatment that he recovered. Yet during all this, time Soma Thera worked with a fortitude which evoked the admiration of all around him. Though the dry climate of Berlin helped his asthma he was not entirely free of attacks. Referring to his fortitude, a friend wrote, “No other monk except another Soma Thera would have ventured forth on such a mission after the serious operation he had to stand only a couple of weeks before”.</phrase>
    </para>
    <para>
      <phrase>Yet the work which he had undertaken absorbed all Soma Thera’s time and attention. He met the leading Buddhists in Berlin, who were anxious to co-operate with the mission’s work, and soon there began a series of weekly meetings at which Soma Thera read a paper in German which was followed by answering questions that the audience liked to ask. The interpreting at these meetings was done by Mr. F. Knobelock, the then President of the Congress of German Buddhist Associations, or by Mr. Guido Auster. This programme was continued till the mission left Berlin. Meanwhile </phrase>
      <literal>[22|xxi]</literal>
      <phrase> Soma Thera addressed schools in various parts of the city. The children listened to him with the greatest interest. Just before leaving Berlin, the mission received an invitation from the Municipality of Iserlohn to conduct a Meditation Seminar during the “Indian Week” which was a part of the ‘Sauerland Cultural Season’. About one hundred people from all walks of life attended it. The late Mr. Egon Vietta was the organiser of the Seminar. On the last day of the Seminar he announced that he had brought a few questions from his teacher, the well-known Existentialist philosopher, Prof. Heidegger, who was ill and unable to travel. When these questions were put to the Yen. Soma Mahā Thera his answers were prompt and so convincing that Mr. Vietta said that these same questions had been put by him to </phrase>
      <phrase>European scholars, individually and in groups, but he had not received such satisfying answers as had been given by Soma Mahā Thera.</phrase>
    </para>
    <para>
      <phrase>Another invitation that the mission accepted was that of the Buddhists of Hamburg. They were anxious to have us with them during Vesak time. So from Iserlohn the mission left for Hamburg, where Mr. W. Stegemann, the President of the Buddhist Society of Hamburg, welcomed us. From here, after making a brief visit to London, Oxford, and Cambridge, the mission returned to Hamburg where Soma Thera conducted classes in meditation, and delivered lectures and led discussions on the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Dhamma</emphasis>
      <phrase>. These meetings were well attended. He much liked working among the Hamburg Buddhists because, as he said, they were well informed, organized, and greatly interested in their work as a body. In response to numerous requests, all the addresses delivered in Germany by Soma Mahā Thera were published by the Hamburg Buddhist Society in their Bulletin the </phrase>

      <phrase>.</phrase>
    </para>
    <para>
      <phrase>With all this incessant work and travel Soma Thera grew weak, and when he returned to Ceylon from Germany in June 1958 he was very tired; but with skilful medical attention and another operation he regained his former vigour and worked hard which he loved to do. Then again he fell ill—this time with renal colic—and after another spell in hospital he was once more in a fit condition to continue his work. This time he slept hardly four hours a day, from about midnight to 4 a.m. When told that he tired himself overmuch, he used to say, “I have gathered enough now but I have not time enough to give”. So he worked on to the end never caring for his health. Yet he was happy doing it.</phrase>
    </para>
    <para>
      <phrase>He was held in affectionate and highest regard by all those who knew him for his qualities of heart and head. One of them wrote from England thus: “I was mentioning to the Dons of the Faculty of Eastern Religions at Oxford that there was in Ceylon a monk (referring to Soma Thera) who was eminently qualified by way of knowledge and learning to fill the Chair of Eastern Religions which is now vacant”. Mr. Guido Auster, the Director of the Oriental Department of the German State Library, Berlin, hearing of his death wrote, “He contacted many personalities of the religious and intellectual life in Berlin and Germany. He delivered lectures at various places, </phrase>
      <literal>[23|xxii]</literal>
      <phrase> among them—most important in my opinion—several to pupils in our schools. He had an especially lucky hand in dealing with children and young people who admired him. He was most patient towards enquirers and beginners”. Again, he says, “This impressive personality, reminding me in his dignity of a high prelate during the Middle Ages, weilding not only spiritual but also temporal power, has dissolved”.</phrase>

Or did he take the aggregate of concentration along with him and become extinct? Or did he take along with him the aggregate of wisdom and become extinct? Or did he take along with him the aggregate of freedom and become extinct?

Comparable to the breaking of a bigger branch of a mighty tree, says the Buddha, is the Venerable Sāriputta Thera’s passing away and no one can stop the breaking of what is breakable by ordering that thing not to break’.</phrase>

      <phrase> It will be noted that ‘the three </phrase>

      <emphasis>Vinaya Piṭaka</emphasis>
      <phrase> nine times from his teacher, while Mahāpaduma Thera learned it eighteen times and was, therefore, the superior.

      <phrase>To show that the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera was aware of the existence of the </phrase>

      <phrase> (</phrase>
      <emphasis>Paramatthamañjūsā</emphasis>
      <phrase>, Venerable Morontuḍuvē Dhammānanda Nāyake Thera’s Sinhalese ed. p. 103) which says: </phrase>

    <para>
      <literal>[38|xxxvii]</literal>
      <phrase> In his Pali Literature of Ceylon, Dr. G. P. Malalasekera has this to say on the subject:</phrase>
    </para>
    <para>
      <phrase>(a) “The </phrase>
      <emphasis>Vimutti-magga</emphasis>
      <phrase> is an Abhidhamma exegesis, serving as a compendium for that portion of Buddhist literature . . . , and in some points the Chinese work seems to have been influenced by the Mahāyāna doctrine” (p. 86).</phrase>
    </para>
    <para>
      <phrase>(b) He says, further, that if it is granted that the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
      <phrase> was taken to China by some of the schools of approximately the same tradition, “it would not be difficult to conclude that the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Visuddhi-magga</emphasis>
      <phrase> and </phrase>
      <emphasis>Vimutti-magga </emphasis>
      <phrase>are more or less independent works, written by men belonging to much the same school of thought — the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Thera-vāda</emphasis>
      <phrase>” (pp. 87-88).</phrase>
    </para>
    <para>
      <phrase>Regarding the statement (a) above, it will be seen that very little </phrase>
      <emphasis>Abhidhamma</emphasis>
      <phrase> is found in the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
      <phrase>, though of course, it begins by saying that he who wishes to “lead those on the other shore to perfection, should be versed in the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Sutta</emphasis>
      <phrase>, </phrase>
      <emphasis>Abhidhamma</emphasis>
      <phrase> and </phrase>
      <emphasis>Vinaya</emphasis>
      <phrase>”. Here, the late Venerable Ñāṇamoli Thera’s opinion on the subject will be of interest: “However the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
      <phrase> itself contains nothing at all of the Mahayana, its unorthodoxies being well within the ‘Hinayana’ field”. Again he says: “Also Abhidhamma, which is the keystone of Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa’s exegesis, is not used at all in the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
      <phrase> (Aggregates, Truths, etc., do not </phrase>
      <emphasis>in themselves</emphasis>
      <phrase> constitute Abhidhamma in the sense of that Pitaka). There is, for instance, even in its description of the Consciousness Aggregate, no reference to the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Dhammasaṅgaṇī</emphasis>
      <phrase>’s classification of 89 types, and nothing from the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Paṭṭhāna</emphasis>
      <phrase>; and though the ‘Cognitive Series’ is stated once in its full form (in Ch. II) no use is made of it to explain conscious workings. This </phrase>
      <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
      <phrase> is in fact a book of practical instruction, not of exegesis” (</phrase>
      <phrase>Path of Purification Introduction</phrase>
      <phrase> pp. xxvii-xxviii). The statement of the Venerable Dhammapāla Thera in the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Paramatthamañjūsā</emphasis>
      <phrase> quoted earlier seems to disallow (b) above.</phrase>

      <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
      <phrase> was the Venerable Upatissa Thera who flourished during King Vasabha’s reign, 66-109 A. C. He says, “However, there is no such great difference as cannot be bridged between his supposition and mine” (Introduction p. VIII).</phrase>

      <phrase>Regarding the view that the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
      <phrase> was a work written at the Abhayagiri Monastery, the late Venerable Ñāṇamoli Thera rightly says, “That it (the </phrase>

      <phrase>) contains some minor points accepted by the Abhayagiri Monastery does not necessarily imply that it had any special connection with that centre.

      <phrase> originated in India, he puts forward, among others, the following reasons (</phrase>

        <citation>Vim. Mag. and Vis. Mag.</citation>

      <phrase>): (a) “It is very likely that Vimuttimagga was one of the books brought over from India. From the internal evidence of the book we may say that there is no reference to any name</phrase>

      <literal>[39|xxxviii]</literal>
      <phrase> the late Venerable Ñāṇamoli Thera, that the “</phrase>
      <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
      <phrase> is in fact a book of practical instruction, not of exegesis” — which is also the view of the late Venerable Soma Thera and myself — is accepted, and if it is recognized that the whole style of the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
      <phrase> makes for brevity — it is even abrupt sometimes —, then it will be seen that the exclusion of any ‘name or place in Ceylon’ is not surprising.</phrase>

      <phrase>(b) “We find in this book many words which are transliterations of Indian words. The list of worms residing in different parts of the body gives names which are transliterations of Indian names. These names must have been taken by Upatissa from some old work or works on medical science” (p. liv). This is as it should be, seeing that the Dhamma is of Indian origin, and when medicine or anything related to medical science is mentioned it is natural for Ceylon writers to use Indian terms: for what medical knowledge Ceylon possessed at the time was of Indian origin. The standard Ayurvedic medical works in use even now are Suśruta and Vāgbhata. Caraka is not unknown.</phrase>

      </phrase>
      <phrase>, </phrase>
      <emphasis>caṇḍāla</emphasis>
      <phrase> is mentioned. Here it should be borne in mind that in the society of the time, and also later, the </phrase>
      <emphasis>caṇḍāla</emphasis>
      <phrase> was a person looked down upon. To illustrate certain points in a way that the large mass of the people would understand, appropriate similes were used by the Buddha and his Disciples, and the commentators who came after them. It does not mean that they thereby endorsed some of the statements made in their similes. For instance, when the Buddha, in the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas</emphasis>
      <phrase>, says, “Just as if a clever butcher or butcher’s apprentice, having slaughtered a cow and divided it into portions were sitting at the main cross-road,” and so on, it does not follow that the Buddha upheld the butchers’ profession. If the word </phrase>
      <emphasis>caṇḍāla</emphasis>
      <phrase> was used in a simile, the motive behind it was nothing else than to facilitate the understanding of the point under discussion. The upholding of the caste system does not come in here. On the contrary, the Buddha and his disciples were opposed to it as we see in the use of the word </phrase>
      <emphasis>caṇḍāla</emphasis>
      <phrase> in a different context referring to an </phrase>
      <emphasis>upāsaka</emphasis>
      <phrase> (i.e., one who has gone to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha for refuge) but who does not observe the </phrase>
      <emphasis>silas</emphasis>
      <phrase> etc. — he being called </phrase>
      <emphasis>upāsakacaṇḍāla</emphasis>
      <phrase> (</phrase>

      <phrase> (</phrase>

        <citation>Sn.</citation>
        <phrase>  116-42</phrase>
      </phrase>
      <phrase>) may also be mentioned here. Further, these sentences occur in the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Vimuttimagga</emphasis>
      <phrase> itself, thus: “Virtue is called excellent joy, the highest of all castes . . . This is to </phrase>
      <literal>[40|xxxix]</literal>
      <phrase> wear the thread which must be worn. This is the sacred caste” (p. 8).</phrase>
    </para>
    <para>
      <phrase>What has largely prompted Prof. Bapat to protest seems to be the statement found in Chapter m dealing with the Austerities, and his objection runs thus: “Let us note one peculiar fact about Upatissa. He seems to have some kind of contempt for, or low opinion of, a </phrase>
      <emphasis>Caṇḍāla</emphasis>
      <phrase>” (p. xlvi). Then on the same page he goes on to say the following, which are possibly the reasons for the statement mentioned above.</phrase>
    </para>
    <para>
      <phrase>(1) “In one place, there is a reference to a </phrase>
      <emphasis>Caṇḍāla</emphasis>
      <phrase> where we are told in a simile that he has no desire for a princely throne” (p. xlvi). The relevant passage is, “As an outcast has no desire for a king’s throne” (p. 25 of the present translation). The same idea is found in the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Visuddhimagga</emphasis>
      <phrase> too, namely, “</phrase>
      <emphasis>Nirāso saddhamme caṇḍālakumārako viya rajje</emphasis>
      <phrase>” (p. 54) — “He is desireless for the Good Law as a </phrase>
      <emphasis>caṇḍāla</emphasis>
      <phrase> (outcast) is for a kingdom”. It is therefore not a statement peculiar to the Venerable Upatissa Thera.</phrase>
    </para>
    <para>
      <phrase>(2) With regard to the next objection: “At another place, to see a </phrase>
      <emphasis>Caṇḍāla</emphasis>
      <phrase> on the way is considered to be a sufficient reason for the laxity in the observance of the practice of </phrase>
      <emphasis>sapadāna-cārikā</emphasis>
      <phrase> (going from house to house in succession for begging one’s food)” (p. xlvi). This is not quite what the text says, as will be seen later. There is no question of laxity. Then the next sentence continues, “Upatissa says that if a mendicant sees a </phrase>
      <emphasis>Caṇḍāla</emphasis>
      <phrase> on the way, he should cover his begging-bowl and may skip over some houses and go further. In the third place we find a lack of conscientiousness (</phrase>
      <emphasis>ahirika</emphasis>
      <phrase>) is compared to a </phrase>
      <emphasis>Caṇḍāla</emphasis>
      <phrase>” (pp. xlvi-xlvii). Further, at p. 23, “Even if he has taken up the practice of a </phrase>
      <emphasis>sapadānacārika</emphasis>

      <phrase> or </phrase>
      <emphasis>upajjhāya</emphasis>
      <phrase>’ is also mentioned as an occasion for exception”. Here is the relevant passage from the present translation (p. 36): “What is the teaching as regards expedience in the observance of ‘regular almsround’? If a bhikkhu on seeing elephants or horses fighting or in rut, at the gate, avoids them, or on seeing an outcast (</phrase>
      <emphasis>caṇḍāla</emphasis>
      <phrase>, transliteration) covers his bowl, or goes behind his preceptor, teacher or a visiting bhikkhu, and thus commits certain faults for expedience’ sake, he does not fail in ‘regular almsround’ ”.</phrase>
    </para>
    <para>
      <phrase>Now let us consider why the expedience in regard to elephants and horses may be resorted to. It is plain that it is to avoid being hurt or even killed. Regarding the preceptor or teacher — it is out of respect due to them. It is an offence not to do so. Again, covering the bowl on seeing a </phrase>
      <emphasis>caṇḍāla</emphasis>
      <phrase> is for self-protection. The society at that time was very much caste-conscious. If the people objected to, or did not favour, the receiving of alms from one they considered an outcast, the support from the large majority of the people would be liable to be withdrawn and the life of the bhikkhu rendered difficult, to say the least. Here the story of the son and heir of the King Duṭṭhagāmaṇi comes readily to mind. It is said that the people were prosperous and happy during his reign and that he had a son named Sālirājakumāra, concerning whom the following is recorded.</phrase>

      <phrase>“Greatly gifted was he and ever took delight in works of merit; he tenderly loved a caṇḍāla woman of exceedingly great beauty.

      <phrase> of July 22, 1956, begins — ‘The horse of Buddhism is dead in India; only the tops of the horse’s ears are still visible in the east and the west of the land’.

      <emphasis>Mahāpaṇḍita</emphasis>
      <phrase> who came to live and teach in Tibet. A native of Bengal, he was ordained young, as a </phrase>
      <emphasis>sāmaṇera</emphasis>
      <phrase>, in a monastery of one thousand monks. He received full ordination in Ceylon, with two well-known Theras, the Venerable Buddhaghosa and the Venerable Dhammakitti as preceptor and teacher respectively. He studied the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Vinaya Prabhā</emphasis>
      <phrase> (Splendour of the Discipline), a </phrase>
      <emphasis>Sarvāstivāda</emphasis>
      <phrase> work. Then he returned to his native country and, after studying the </phrase>
      <emphasis>Kālacakra</emphasis>
      <phrase>, went to Tibet by way of Assam. The Lama says: “During the journey he is believed to have remembered his Sinhalese preceptor, and inscribed on a wayside rock these words: ‘I salute Buddhaghosa the teacher of thousands of beings’ ”. And he says further that in the middle of the seventeenth century the lama king of Bhutan, when at war with the Central Tibet government, had seen and mentioned it in one of his writings. On reaching Tibet his interpreter died, and so after a short stay there he returned to Bengal. “Vanaratana’s second visit to Ceylon lasted six years; during that time he studied all branches of Buddhism”, says the lama. The Venerable Vanaratana in his account of a pilgrimage he made to Śrī Padā in Ceylon states that he received two bone relics there. Then again the lama goes on to say, “With the relics and some books he had collected, Vanaratana returned to his country and not long afterwards reentered Tibet. This time he was able to speak Tibetan well; he made many lamas his disciples through his preaching. The chief of Vanaratana’s disciples was Rong-Thong-Pa, the founder of a new sect; to him Vanaratana gave one of the relics he had got in Ceylon. Rong-Thong-Pa built near Lhasa a monastery called Nālandā”. The Venerable Vanaratana died fifteen years after he re-entered Tibet “at a monastery in Singpori in Tsang province; his tomb can still be seen in that monastery . . . The full admission of Vanaratana to the Sangha by Ceylon theras, and the long stay here, point to the existence of cordial relations between the Indian and Ceylon Sangha of his time. Tibetan books show that Ratnākara Gupta of Vikramaṡīla stayed in Ceylon for seven years on his way to Dhanyakaṭaka; and Atīṡa (Dīpaṁkara Śrī Jñāna), who became abbot of Vikramaṡīla, was here in the eleventh century”. Further, I myself remember the late lama, when he was preparing this article, mentioning to the Venerable Soma Thera that he had seen in a monastery in Tibet a Sinhalese manuscript which, he said, probably dated back to the Venerable Vanaratana Thera’s time.</phrase>

        <phrase>, The Path of Purification, the late Venerable Ñāṇamoli Thera, after carefully sifting a large collection of material, points out that the influence of Sanskrit Buddhism, the centre of which was the Abhayagiri monastery in Anuradhapura, was so great in the first century A.C. that it became a threat to the Mahāvihāra’s </phrase>
        <literal>[45|xliv]</literal>
        <phrase> position as the central authority of orthodox Pali Buddhism in Ceylon. Indeed that threat grew into open rivalry and even enmity between these two institutions, culminating in King Mahāsena’s (277-304) giving protection to Sanghamitta, “a Cola monk, follower of Vetullavāda”, and driving away the monks of the Mahāvihāra from Anuradhapura for nine years. Then, Mahāsena, repenting of his deeds, restored the Mahāvihāra to its former position and burnt the Vetulyan books. But by then Sanghamitta had got the Lohapāsāda destroyed, and he and his friend, the minister Soṇa, were killed by a labourer on the orders of the queen when they attempted to destroy the Thūpārāma. The efforts of the Mahāvihāra monks since the beginning of the dispute with those of the Abhayagiri in the first century A.C. were solely directed to the establishment, says the Venerable Ñāṇamoli Thera, of “Pali as the language for the study and discussion of Buddhist teachings, and the founding of a school of Pali literary composition” (Intro, p. xiv). He then goes on to say, “It is not known what was the first original Pali composition in this period; but the </phrase>

They are: (1) The desperate need of the Mahāvihāra for a work which would prove its claim to be the centre of Buddhist learning in Ceylon; (2) the equally urgent need of the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera to prove his ability as a worthy scholar in the eyes of the Theras of the Mahāvihāra.

        <emphasis role="bold">A.</emphasis>
        <phrase> There is a good man. He is like a blind man who wanders to a distant land without guidance, because, although he wishes to gain freedom, he does not listen to the teaching of freedom; because he does not acknowledge freedom and because he wrongly acknowledges freedom. Since he is hemmed in by much suffering he cannot gain freedom. Although he wishes to gain freedom, he has not the means. To gain freedom means are necessary. The Buddha has declared: “There are beings covered with but a little dust. They will fall away unless they hear the Truth”.</phrase>

        <phrase> vulgarity, contact with women, not honouring the teacher, non-practice of restraint of the senses, non-practice of concentration in the first and last watches of the night, not reciting the discourses in the first and last watches of the night — these thirty-four states are ‘obstacles’. A man impeded by any one of these cannot perfect his virtue. If his virtue is not perfected he will surely retrogress. The thirty-four states which counteract these (‘obstacles’) are the ‘cause’ of virtue.</phrase>

In various ways he slights and troubles (others). He withholds what is good from the younger bhikkhus. He gives what is mean to the venerable ones. Without permission, he bums fuel in the bath-room and opens and shuts the door. Or when he goes to the waterside, he enters it (the water) before them (the venerable ones) and twists and turns his body, or pats, in the fashion of rustics. When he goes to another’s house he enters abruptly, either by the back or by the front door; sits down and gets up in a disorderly manner; or he enters screened places and jokes with women and young girls and strokes their necks.

If a man guards his mind in goodness, he can well protect his bodily and verbal actions. ‘(Virtue) connected with the requisites’ is ‘restraint of faculties’. What is the reason?

    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">A.</emphasis>
      <phrase> Because of the varying disposition of the yogin. For paucity of wishes, for contentment with little, for freedom from doubt, for the destruction of craving, for the increase of energy, for the sake of using little and not accepting the offerings made to others, for solitude, for the cutting down of clinging and for the protection of moral virtue. These (the merits of the austerities) are the equipment of concentration. These are (practices of) the ancient lineage of the Ariyas.</phrase>

        <phrase> these eight are taught: “‘Measured food’ and ‘one-eating’ are involved in ‘no food after time’. ‘Dwelling under a tree’, ‘dwelling in a dewy place’, ‘dwelling among the graves’ are involved in ‘dwelling in a peaceful place’, because, if one gathers funds for building a house, or if one likes to (do remunerative) work, keeps animals or is attached to ‘dwelling in a peaceful place’, one’s mind is not at ease. Thus thinking one dwells in peace ‘under a tree’, ‘among the graves’ or ‘in a dewy place’ ”. Thus the eight are fulfilled.</phrase>

      <para>
        <phrase>By these eight austerities three teachings are fulfilled: the first: ‘dwelling in a peaceful place’, the second: ‘dirt-rags’, the third: ‘begged food’. If these three are pure, the austerities are fulfilled. Therefore the Buddha taught the Venerable Elder Nanda thus: “Always you should observe ‘dwelling in a peaceful place’, ‘dirt-rags’ and ‘begged food’. You should not nurse your body and life. You should not see the objects of lust.”</phrase>

The Buddha has said, “If a bhikkhu who observes (the austerity of) ‘dirt-rags’ is endowed with paucity of wishes, is contented with little, enjoys tranquillity, is doubt-free and relies on freedom, then he is called one who observes (the austerity of) ‘dirt-rags’ ”.</phrase>

        <phrase> The other austerities are all greedless and delusion-free. By means of this greedlessness, a bhikkhu removes ignorance in thirteen places. And again by this greed lessness which the Buddha made possible (a bhikkhu) arouses in his mind aversion, and being free from doubt, reasonably removes the stain of lust and crookedness. By this freedom from delusion, he removes weariness of the flesh and crookedness. These are the two teachings of austerities. These are greedlessness and freedom from delusion. </phrase>

Delusion is non-doubting. By means of the austerities a bhikkhu can fulfil heedfulness. If he is heedful, he can overcome delusion well.

And after completing his alms-round, he wended his way to the bank of the river Kimilāla. The land there was level meadow, and it was known as the Grove of Sweet Mango. Beside it ran the excellent waters of Kimilāla, sparklingly clear. Seeing the pleasant place, the Venerable Elder Meghiya was delighted and thought: ‘The land here is level meadow and is known as the Grove of Sweet Mango.

          <phrase>And having finished his meal, put aside his bowl and robe, washed his hands and feet, he, with one shoulder bared, went to the presence of the Enlightened One, bowed at the Enlightened One’s feet, and sat on one side. And being seated he spoke thus: “Venerable Sir, in the morning, having taken bowl and robe, I went to the village of Jantugāma for alms……….: and I thought: ‘The land here is level meadow and is known as the Grove of Sweet Mango. Beside it runs the excellent waters of Kimilāla, sparklingly clear. Meet is this spot for a clansman for the exercise of energy’.

Then the Venerable Elder Meghiya thought of the Blessed One, arose from his seat and forthwith returned to the presence of the Blessed One (and told the Blessed One everything) and the Blessed One said: ‘Your mind is not yet ripe for deliverance. If you wish to cause it to ripen, you should train yourself in the five trainings. What are the five?

What do you think, householder, would that man stretch out his hand or any other member of his body to the snake, saying, ‘Bite me, bite me’?” Then the householder answered: “No, venerable Gotama, because on seeing the venomous snake he would think: ‘If I were to stretch forth my hand or other member of my body and let the snake bite it, I should die or suffer severely’. And so, on seeing that venomous snake, he wishes to flee from it”. Householder, the learned, noble disciple also thinks in the same way: ‘Sense-desires are like a venomous snake. It was taught by the Blessed One that sense-desires are like a venomous snake. They yield little pleasure, produce much suffering and are pain-laden’. And he abandons sense-desires, becomes freed from evil states of mind and causes to perish all worldly enjoyment and clings to nothing”.</phrase>

Torpor: This is the desire for sleep owing to heaviness of the body. There are three kinds of torpor: the first, proceeds from food; the second, from time; the third, from the mind. If it proceeds from the mind, one removes it with meditation. If it proceeds from food and time as in the case of the Arahant, because it does not proceed from the mind, it is not a hindrance. If it proceeds from food and time, one cuts it with energy as the Venerable Elder Anuruddha taught: “Since first I destroyed the cankers for fifty-five years, have I not slept the sleep that proceeds from the mind. And during this period for twenty-five years, have I removed the sleep that proceeds from food and time”.</phrase>

          <phrase> These two states have one object and one function. What are called torpor and rigidity become one. Agitation is non-tranquillity of mind; anxiety is unsteadiness of mind; the characteristics of these are equal. Therefore they become one hindrance. Uncertainty is the clinging of the mind to diverse objects. There are four kinds of uncertainty: the first is a hindrance to serenity,</phrase>

If one has that uncertainty, it is called a hindrance to serenity; uncertainty concerning the Four Noble Truths and the three worlds is called a hindrance to insight; uncertainty concerning the Buddha, the Law and the Community of Bhikkhus is called a hindrance to both. Uncertainty concerning things like country, town, road, name of man or woman is called hindrance to things non-doctrinal. Uncertainty concerning the Discourses is a hindrance to solitude.

If, saying, “I will remove the cause of suffering”, one attains to equanimity, it is called the equanimity of insight. The practising of the enlightenment factors is the equanimity of the enlightenment factors.

The other concentration by causing calmness to arise out of the solitude of the sphere of nothingness. This is called the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception. “Sphere of neither perception nor non-perception”: The mind and the mental properties which enter the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception are called the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception. What is the meaning of “sphere of neither perception nor non-perception”? Through the removal of coarse perception, he is endowed with non-perception. Through there being a remainder of fine perception, he enters the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception.

          <phrase>“How is the sign grasped”?: The man who takes up the fire sign grasps the sign in fire, i.e., in a natural or a prepared place. Here, a practised yogin grasps the natural sign. (He grasps the sign) on seeing any fire, i.e., a grass-fire, a wood-fire, a forest-fire or a house that is on fire. He develops the natural or the prepared as he pleases and sees the appropriate sign. Thus the after-image of fire occurs to him. The new yogin is different.

He sends his mind towards the fire sign by directing it to the middle of the thick flames and grasps the sign through three ways: through even gazing, skilfulness </phrase>

The training and the undisturbed dwelling of the mind in that perception — these are called the practising of it.

Thus he goes to the place of putrescent corpses. Avoiding contrary winds, he remains there, standing or sitting, with the putrescent sign before him, and not too far from nor too near it. And that yogin makes a rock, an ant-hill, tree, bush or a creeper, near the place where the putrescent thing lies, one with the sign, one with the object, and considers thus: “This rock is impure, this is the impure sign, this is the rock”.

These are known as the fourteen great joints. “From the cavities” means: “He determines whether the mouth is open or closed, and whether the eyes are open or closed. He determines the hollows of the hands and the feet”. “From low parts and from high parts” means: “He determines whether the putrescent sign is m a low place or in a high place; and again, he determines thus: ‘I am in a low place, the putrescent sign is in a high place’, or, ‘The putrescent sign is in a low place, I am in a high place’. “He considers from all sides” means: “He determines a distance of two or three fathoms from the sign, because he does not grasp the sign by being too near it or too far from it, and considering all things, he grasps the sign (saying), “</phrase>

Non-delusion is thus: When a yogin goes to a still place and sees the putrescent sign, fear arises in him; at such a time, if the corpse appears to stand up before him, he does not stand up, but reflects. In this way he knows, recollects, rightly understands, regards well and fully investigates the sign. In the same way he considers all signs. This is (the indication of) non-delusion.</phrase>

            <phrase> When a man wishes to separate from passion, he causes the arising of the perception regarding the nature of his body. Because, if he has the perception of the nature of his body, he can quickly acquire the perception of its disagreeableness and cause the arising of the after-image. If the perception of putrescence is increased, the sign which he has grasped in his body will disappear. If he loses the perception of his own body, he will not be able to acquire the thought of disagreeableness quickly. Therefore, he should not increase.</phrase>

Again, it is taught that he counts from one to five but does not count beyond five. He does not miss. At that time (i.e., when he misses) he should count (the next) or stop that count.

          <phrase> What is mindfulness of death? What is the practising of it? What are its salient characteristic, function and near cause? What are its benefits? What is the procedure?</phrase>

        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">A.</emphasis>
          <phrase> The cutting off of the life-faculty — this is called death. The undisturbed mindfulness of this — this is called the practising of it. The cutting off of one’s life is its salient characteristic. Disagreeableness is its function. Well-being is its near cause.</phrase>
        </para>
        <para>
          <phrase>What are its benefits? He who practises mindfulness of death is possessed of diligence as regards the higher meritorious states, and of dislike as regards the demeritorious. He does not hoard clothes and ornaments. He is not stingy. He is able to live long, does not cling to things, is endowed with the perception of impermanence, the perception of subjection to ill and the perception of not-self. He fares well and approaches the ambrosial. When he comes to die, he does not suffer bewilderment.</phrase>
        </para>
        <para>
          <phrase>What is the procedure? The new yogin enters a place of solitude and guards his thoughts. He considers the death of beings with mind undistracted thus: “I shall die; I shall enter the realm of death; I shall not escape death”. Thus it is taught in the Nettipada Sutta:</phrase>

          <phrase>Here there are four kinds in mindfulness of death: (1) Associated with anxiety. (2) Associated with fear. (3) Associated with indifference. (4) Associated with wisdom.</phrase>

          <literal>[230|167]</literal>
          <phrase> of one’s own child is associated with fear. The mindfulness of death by a burner (of corpses) is associated with indifference. Remembering (the nature of) the world, one develops aversion — this is called associated with wisdom. Here the yogin should not practise the mindfulness associated with anxiety, fear or indifference, because </phrase>

        <para>
          <phrase>There are three kinds of death thus: death according to general opinion, death as a complete cutting off, momentary death. What is “death according to general opinion”? Death as it is understood in common parlance. This is called “death according to general opinion”. “Death as a complete cutting off” means: “The Consummate One has cut off the defilements”. “Momentary death” means: “The momentary perishing of all formations”.</phrase>

          <emphasis role="bold">A.</emphasis>
          <phrase> Like a man who is being taken to a place to be killed. When that man sees the murderer drawing out a sword and following him, he thinks thus: “This man intends to kill me; I shall be killed at any moment; I shall be killed at any step. I shall surely be killed if I turn back. I shall surely be killed if I sit down; I shall surely be killed if I sleep”. Thus should the yogin practise mindfulness of death “through the presence of a murderer”. </phrase>
          <emphasis role="bold">Q.</emphasis>
          <phrase> How should one practise mindfulness of death “through the absence of an efficient cause”? There is no cause or skill that can make life immortal. When the sun and the moon rise, no cause or skill can make them turn back. Thus the yogin practises mindfulness of death. </phrase>

          <phrase> Many kings who possessed great treasures, great vehicle-kings, Mahā Sudassana of great supernormal power, Mandhātu and all other kings entered the state of death. And again, many sages of old, Vessamitta and Yamataggi, who possessed </phrase>
          <literal>[231|168]</literal>
          <phrase> great supernormal power and who caused fire and water to issue forth from their bodies, also entered the state of death. Great hearers of old like the Venerable Elders Sāriputta, Moggallāna and others, who were possessed of immense wisdom and power also entered the state of death. Many Paccekabuddhas who attained enlightenment without owning a teacher, and who were endowed with all virtue, also entered the state of death. And again, they who come and go in the same way, the Consummate, Supremely Enlightened, Matchless Ones, endowed with knowledge and conduct, who have won the further shore of merit — many such also entered the state of death. How shall I with my brief life-span escape entry into the state of death? Thus the yogin practises mindfulness of death “through inference”. </phrase>
          <emphasis role="bold">Q.</emphasis>
          <phrase> How does one practise mindfulness of death” through the body being common to the many”? </phrase>
          <emphasis role="bold">A.</emphasis>
          <phrase> Through the disorder of wind and phlegm, the state of death is fulfilled. Through the disturbance of many worms or through lack of drink and food, the state of death is fulfilled. Or through being bitten by poisonous snakes, centipedes, millepedes, or rats, death is fulfilled. Or through being mauled by a lion, a tiger or a leopard, or through being attacked by a demon (nāga), or through being gored by a cow, death is fulfilled. Or through being killed by humans or non-humans, death is fulfilled. Thus one practises mindfulness of death “through the body being common to the many”. </phrase>

Or could I live for half a day, or for a short while. Could I live long enough to partake of a single meal, half a meal, or even long enough to gather and partake of four or five morsels of food!

          <phrase> As parents, on seeing their dear and only child, arouse thoughts of loving-kindness and benevolence towards that child, so one arouses thoughts of loving-kindness and benevolence towards all beings. Thus is loving-kindness to be known. The undisturbed dwelling of the mind in this practice is called the practising of it. To cause the arising of benevolence is its salient characteristic. The thought of loving-kindness is its function. Non-hatred is its manifestation. If a man practises loving-kindness, he is benefitted in eleven ways thus: Happily he sleeps; happily he awakes; he does not see bad dreams; he is dear to humans; he is dear to non-humans; deities protect him; fire, poison, sword and stick come not near him; he concentrates his mind quickly; the colour of his face is pleasingly bright; at the time of death he is not bewildered; if he attains not the sublime state, he is reborn in the world of Brahma.</phrase>

          <phrase>What is the procedure? The new yogin who aspires to practise loving-kindness, should at first reflect on the disadvantages of anger and resentment and on the advantages of patience and bear patience in mind. What is meant by “should at first reflect on the disadvantages of anger and resentment”? If a man arouses anger and resentment, his thoughts of loving-kindness will be consumed and his mind will become impure. Thereafter he will frown; thereafter he will utter harsh words; thereafter he will stare in the four directions; thereafter he will lay hold of stick and sword; thereafter he will convulse with rage and spit blood; thereafter he will hurl valuables hither and thither; thereafter he will break many things; thereafter he will kill others or kill himself. And again, if a man is angry and resentful always, he, owing to his wicked mind, is liable to kill his parents, or kill a Consummate One or </phrase>
          <phrase>cause a schism in the Community of Bhikkhus, or draw blood from the body of an Enlightened One. Such fearful acts is he liable to do. Thus should one reflect.</phrase>

          <phrase> Thus the yogin proceeds towards the bliss of patience and benefits himself. He enters into a place of solitude, and with mind undisturbed begins to fill his body (with the thought) thus: “I am happy. My mind admits no suffering”. What is meant by “I have no enemy; I have no anger; I am happily free from all defilements and perform all good”.? That yogin controls his mind and makes it pliant. He makes his mind capable of attainment. If his mind is pliant, and is able to bear the object, he should practise loving-kindness. He should regard all beings as (he regards) himself. In practising loving-kindness towards all beings, the yogin cannot at the start develop loving-kindness for enemies, wicked </phrase>
          <phrase>men, beings without merit and dead men. That yogin develops loving-kindness for one towards whom he behaves with respectful reserve, whom he honours, whom he does not slight, towards whom he is not indifferent, and by whom he has been benefitted and, therefore, in regard to whom he is not jealous or ill-disposed. He should develop loving-kindness for such a one, thus: “I esteem a man who is of such and such a nature, namely, a man endowed with honour, learning, virtue, concentration and wisdom. I am benefitted through alms, sweet speech, liberality and intentness on that. These are of advantage to me”. Thus he recalls to mind the virtues he esteems </phrase>

          <phrase> and the benefits he has acquired (in and through that one), and develops loving-kindness towards that one.

One should wish to gain a good reward, a good name, to gain confidence, to gain happiness, to be endowed with virtue, knowledge, liberality and wisdom. One should wish for happy sleep and happy awaking. One should wish to have no evil dreams. One should wish to become dear to humans and to be honoured by them. One should wish to become dear to non-humans and to be honoured by them.

          <phrase> As parents, who, on seeing the happiness of their dear and only child are glad, and say, “</phrase>
          <emphasis>Sādhu!</emphasis>
          <phrase>” so, one develops appreciative joy for all beings. Thus should appreciative joy be known. The undisturbed dwelling of the mind in appreciative joy — this is called the practising of it. Gladness is its salient characteristic. Non-fear is its function. Destruction of dislike is its manifestation. Its benefits are equal to those of loving-kindness.</phrase>
        </para>
        <para>
          <phrase>What is the procedure? The new yogin enters a place of solitude and sits down with mind collected and undisturbed. When one sees or hears that some person’s qualities are esteemed by others, and that he is at peace and is joyful, one thinks thus: “</phrase>
          <emphasis>Sādhu! sādhu!</emphasis>
          <phrase> may he continue joyful for a long time!”. And again, when one sees or hears that a certain person does not follow demeritorious doctrines, or that he does not follow undesirable doctrines and that he follows desirable doctrines, one thinks thus: “</phrase>
          <emphasis>Sādhu! sādhu!</emphasis>
          <phrase> may he continue joyful for a. long time!”. That yogin by these means and through these activities develops the thought of appreciative joy and repeats it. Having by these means and through these activities developed the thought of appreciative joy and repeated it, he makes his mind pliant, and capable of bearing the object. Thereafter he gradually develops appreciative joy for an indifferent person and an enemy. The rest is as was fully taught above. Thus with appreciative joy he fills the four directions.</phrase>

          <phrase> As parents are neither too attentive nor yet inattentive towards any one of their children, but regard them equally and maintain an even mind towards them, so through equanimity one maintains an even mind towards all beings. Thus should equanimity be known. The dwelling undisturbed in equanimity—this is called the practising of it. Non-attachment is its salient characteristic. Equality is its function. The suppression of disliking and liking is its manifestation. Its benefits are equal to those of loving-kindness.</phrase>

          <phrase>, and acquired facility therein, he sees the severe trials of loving-kindness, compassion and appreciative joy. Liking and disliking are near. These (loving-kindness etc.) are connected with fawning, elation and gladness. The merits of equanimity lie in the overcoming of these severe trials. That yogin, having seen the severe trials of loving-kindness, compassion and appreciative joy and the merits of equanimity, develops equanimity towards a neutral person</phrase>

          <emphasis>jhāna</emphasis>
          <phrase>, through equanimity. In three ways he attains to fixed meditation, </phrase>

          <emphasis role="bold">Q.</emphasis>
          <phrase> When the yogin practises equanimity, how does he consider beings? </phrase>
          <emphasis role="bold">A.</emphasis>
          <phrase> The yogin considers thus: “In loving-kindness, compassion and appreciative joy, one is overjoyed with beings”, and removing joy, he induces equanimity. As a man might leap for joy on meeting a long-lost friend </phrase>
          <varname>(438)</varname>
          <phrase> and later, calm down, having been with him for sometime, so having lived long with loving-kindness, compassion and appreciative joy, the yogin attains to equanimity. And again, there is a man. He speaks concerning beings, “Beings consider thus: What is the fulfilment of equanimity? What is its non-fulfilment?” When equanimity is fulfilled, one destroys disliking and liking and does not cause the arising of ignorance. Through two causes equanimity is not fulfilled: through resentment produced within oneself and through the arising of ignorance.</phrase>

          <phrase> It is comparable to a skilful master of puppets who makes of wood (effigies) of humans, complete in every part, in the form of man or woman, and makes these walk, dance, sit or squat through the pulling of strings. Thus these puppets are called bodies; the master of puppets is the past defilement by which this body is made complete; the strings are the tendons; the clay is flesh; the paint is the skin; the interstices are space. (By) jewels, raiment and ornaments (they) are called men and women. Thoughts (of men and women) are to be known as the tugging by the element of air. Thus they walk, dwell, go out, or come in, stretch out, draw in, converse or speak.</phrase>

        <phrase> “Will” is the wish to do. “Concentration” is non-distraction of the mind. That yogin wishes for supernormal power and the bases of supernormal power, and practises concentration and resolves upon the four kinds of endeavour. He endeavours to preclude the arising of evil demeritorious states that have not yet arisen; he endeavours to reject the evil demeritorious [[276|213]] states that have already arisen; he endeavours to cause the arising of meritorious states that have not yet arisen; he endeavours to increase and to consciously reproduce the meritorious states that have already arisen; and to develop them fully. These are called “the activities of endeavour”. “Endowed” means that one is endowed with these three qualities. Thus the six parts of the term are completed. “Basis of supernormal power”: That by which one attains to supernormal power—the “basis of supernormal power” is only that. Therefore that state is called “basis of supernormal power”. And again, the fulfilment of the activities of endeavour and the concentration of will—this is called the “basis of supernormal power”. It is the means of attending to supernormal power. This is the principal meaning. “Develops” means: “Practises and repeats it”. This is called “the development of the basis of supernormal power endowed with the activities of endeavour and the concentration of will”. Thus that yogin practises. This is the means of success:- Sometimes he falls back; sometimes he abides. He causes the arising of energy. He fulfils </phrase>
        <varname>(442)</varname>
        <phrase> this basis of supernormal power which is endowed with concentration of energy and the activities of endeavour. (In) this means of success, he sometimes slackens, sometimes falls back, sometimes is perturbed. When the mind slackens, he produces the mental characteristic of alacrity; when the mind falls away, he produces concentration of mind; when the mind is perturbed, he produces the characteristic of equanimity. Thus his mind acquires the basis of supernormal power which is endowed with concentration of mind and the activities of endeavour. If one has a mind that is without defilement, one understands advantage and disadvantage with ease. He practises (saying): “Now is the time to develop”, or “now is not the time to develop”. Thus he accomplishes “the basis of supernormal power which is endowed with concentration of scrutiny and the activities of endeavour”. Thus that yogin develops the four bases of supernormal power. His mind, being wieldy, responds to the body, and his body responds to the mind. Thus that yogin sometimes controls the body with his mind, and sometimes the mind with his body. Depending on the body, the mind changes; depending on the mind, the body changes. Depending on the body, the mind resolves; depending on the mind, the body resolves. The perception of bliss and lightness adheres to the body. In that state he accomplishes and abides. Practising thus, that yogin reaches the acme of lightness, makes his body exceedingly pliant, and attains to the capacity-limit of resolve, even as a ball of iron made red-hot is capable of being fashioned into any shape easily. Thus having through mental </phrase>
        <phrase>culture made his body light, he, owing to the lightness of body, enters the fourth meditation, </phrase>
        <emphasis>jhāna</emphasis>
        <phrase>, and is mindful and tranquil. Rising therefrom, he knows space, and resolves through knowledge. Thus his body is able to rise up in space, Having resolved through knowledge, </phrase>
        <literal>[277|214]</literal>
        <phrase> he can rise up in space. It is comparable to cottonwool blown by the wind.</phrase>

        <phrase>, peacefully, he, at first, fills his body with light. He sees the colour of his own heart through divine sight. Through this colour he perceives his own states of consciousness, and knows through the changes in colour the changes in his own mind: “This colour proceeds from the faculty of joy; this colour proceeds from the faculty of fear; this colour proceeds from the faculty of equanimity”. If the consciousness which is accompanied by the faculty of joy arises, the heart is of the colour of curds and ghee. If the consciousness which is accompanied by the faculty of melancholy arises, it (the heart) is purple in colour. If the consciousness which is accompanied by the faculty of equanimity arises, it (the heart) is of the colour of honey. If the consciousness which is accompanied by lustful desire arises, it (the heart) is yellow in colour. If the consciousness which is accompanied by anger arises, it (the heart) is black in colour. If the consciousness which is accompanied by ignorance arises, it (the heart) is muddy in colour. If the consciousness which is accompanied by confidence and knowledge arises, it (the heart) is pure in colour. Thus that yogin understands the changes in colour through the changes within himself.

To that yogin who strengthens and increases his light, there is nothing obscure. There is nothing covered, and he surpasses the sun in splendour. Practising thus, that yogin diffuses his body with light and attends to colour and form. With the purified divine sight which surpasses human vision, that yogin “sees beings disappearing and reappearing, coarse and fine, beautiful and ugly, faring well or faring ill, according to their deeds.</phrase>

If he suppresses these defilements, but does not acquire facility in concentration, his power of divine sight is limited, owing to non-acquirement of facility. That yogin sees a limited splendour with limited divine sight. His vision of forms is also limited; therefore the Blessed One taught thus: “At a time when my concentration is limited, my eye is limited; and with a limited eye I know a limited splendour and I see limited forms.

In respect of the six kinds of consciousness, organ and object proceed from the past. In respect of mind-consciousness-element, organ-production occurs at the moment of conception.

Through the visible object entering the field (of presentation?), the life-continuum vibrates, and is followed by adverting to the visible object. Adverting which depends on the eye is followed by discerning. This is followed by reception in the sense of experience. Then follows examining in the sense of (investigating) experience. After that comes determining in the sense of understanding. Determining proceeds and is followed by apperception according to action. Apperception proceeding in the sense of full cognition and not in the sense of means, is followed by registration of effect. After that consciousness lapses into the life-continuum.</phrase>

          <phrase> of the mind-sphere is due to name. Conditioned by the four primaries, nutriment and caloric order, the other five (internal) sense-spheres develop and increase. The other does not depend on these. Therefore, conditioned by name-form, the six-sphered-sense arises. By the union of the other faculties, objects, elements and consciousness, contact arises. Therefore, conditioned by the six-sphered-sense, contact arises. Through the sense of touch one experiences pain, pleasure and neither pain nor pleasure. Should one not be touched (then there would be no feeling for him). Therefore, conditioned by contact, feeling arises. The uninstructed commoner experiences pleasure and clings to it and craving for more, he experiences pain; and overcoming it (pain), he, desiring ease, develops the feeling of neither pain nor pleasure, or equanimity.</phrase>

Conditioned by this consciousness, name-form arises. From feeling joy is produced. Conditioned by joy and conditioned by the joy- producing material object, the bare faculties arise.

Through attachment to bare pleasure and conditioned by craving, clinging arises. Through attachment to and conditioned by clinging, there is becoming.

Here, one should know the disease as ill; the cause and condition as origin; the ending of the disease as cessation; and the medicine as the Path. Thus should these be known through series.</phrase>

The sign of birth is arising. The characteristic of change is passing away. When these two passages are perceived with the eye of wisdom, there is knowledge of “rise and fall”. The feeling that has arisen, continues. The characteristic of the coming to be of feeling, perception, the formations and consciousness is arising; the characteristic of change in them is passing away.

          <phrase> There are two kinds in addiction to rites and ceremonies. They are, (addiction due to) craving and (addiction due to) delusion. (Here one thinks thus:) “Through this vow, through this conduct, through this painful practice and through this holiness, I shall be reborn in heaven or I shall be reborn in every heaven”. This is called addiction to rites and ceremonies due to craving. Here a recluse or a brahmin thinks: “Through this virtue, through this purity and the action of purity of virtue, (I shall be reborn etc.)”. This is called addiction to rites and ceremonies due to delusion.</phrase>

Immediately after, the Stream-entrant cuts off the three fetters. Therefore his object is unconditioned.

Although emancipation is gained, there is hankering left, yet; therefore unhankered emancipation is won. Thus the three emancipations are fulfilled. Through attention (to impermanence etc.) emancipation of the mind is gained. Through emancipation from the sign and attachment, void emancipation is won and the three emancipations are fulfilled; because if emancipation from attachment is fulfilled, it also is emancipation due to attention to the sign. Thus after attaining to the three emancipations the one Path is fulfilled.</phrase>

How bhikkhus, does the attainment of knowledge occur, by gradual training, work, and practice? Here, a man imbued with faith draws near; drawing near, he sits down near by; sitting down near by, he pays attention; paying attention, he hears the doctrine; having heard the doctrine, he remembers it; of what he remembers, he examines the meaning; while he examines the meaning, the teachings become intelligible to him; when to him the teachings become intelligible, ardour is born in him; when he is with ardour, he becomes energetic; having become energetic, he investigates the nature, of things; having investigated the nature of things, he strives to reach the Path; while striving to reach the Path, he realises truly by his mental body the highest truth and sees it, having penetrated it with wisdom’.</phrase>

      <literal>[419|356]</literal>
      <phrase> concentration, are aspects of right effort to which the yogi has to pay attention. The practice of contemplation however, is born with the effort to control the sense-faculties. It may be rightly said that the long journey to peace and immunity from mental ill through the Path does not really begin until the restraint of sense-faculties, which stops the arising of thoughts useless for release from ill, become habitual to the yogi. When control of the sense-faculties becomes strong and a habit, it makes for the maturing of the qualities necessary for intuition of highest freedom. The value of constant practice of restraint of the sense-faculties is brought out in the story given below of the Elder Mahātissa who dwelt on Cetiya Hill (Mihintale).</phrase>

And she who was going to the house of her relatives saw on the way the worshipful Elder of calm demeanour and broke out into wanton laughter with low intent of making him look at her. The Elder, who was walking with attention on his basic contemplation subject, wondering ‘What is it?’ looked up. And because of his seeing the row of bones of her teeth, his own contemplation subject of bones became clear to his mind. Developing insight then and there, he attained the Fruit of Arahatship.

The object, however, came up to him in a dream. Seeing danger in it, he was strongly moved to rid himself of the disturbing thought. He visited a teacher of contemplation. Having got from him a contemplation subject connected with the foulness of the body and opposed to lust, he practised contemplation in a jungle, and attained the third Path of Sanctitude after destroying lust.</phrase>

      <phrase>desire is serenity; it is a name for concentration’. Insight has been explained thus, ‘What sees things in different ways, according to impermanence and the like, is insight; it is a name for wisdom’. These two, serenity and insight, are essential, factors of the Supramundane Path. But they are also necessary to the antecedent part of the Path leading to the highest. In the antecedent part of the Path these two are mundane factors. Thus they have first to be developed as mundane qualities before they can become supramundane.</phrase>
