		<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p><em>Visuddhimagga</em> is one of the most important commenterial works in Theravada, yet, in 2023, we still don't have a good electronic edition. Buddhist Publication Society (BPS) created and published one in 2011, but released it in print and PDF hardcopy. <em>Sadhu</em> for their work, but it is still not good enough for electronic devices, let alone future-proof.</p>
		<h2>Goal</h2>
			<p>This project aims at providing high-quality machine-readable Visuddhimagga, plus several machine-generated electronic editions (such as HTML, ePub, PDF).</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Steps</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt>(0. ✅ politics)</dt><dd><em>Is this legal? I contacted BPS who has the © (no reply so far). I believe BPS is motivated by the benefit of all practitioners and there won't be any objections.</em> It would be nice to have green light (or even source data) from BPS. Eventually, sites like <a href="https://accesstoinsight.org">accesstoinsight.org</a> might offer “our” electronic version, in addition to their PDF.</dd>
					<dt>1. ✅ semantic representation</dt><dd>The BPS edition was used as a basis for XML representation of the contents. This was done in <a href="https://github.com/eudoxos/vism/blob/origin/03-lxml-html.ipynb">hacky ways</a> but the result are quite good semantic data (that is, hyperlinks, paragraphs, sections, cross-references &amp;c are tagged as such). Outputs generated from these data show their soundness.
					<dt>2. ✅ verification</dt><dd> This seems to be done: making sure that the current data are complete and did not suffer from a structural problem during the automated conversion.</dd>
					<dt>3. ✅ automation</dt><dd>The repository had CI (continuous integration) which produces various formats. Tuning those formats is not yet the objective, but they look good and are already usable.</dd>
					<dt>4. corrections 🔧</dt><dd>Hand-editing the data to fix non-structural errors mentioned above. <b>LaTeX- and Sphinx-based formats have issue hyperlinks on page numbers and § labels</b> — thus it is easy to help. Those include:
						<ul>
							<li>obvious errors in the BPS edition (few);</li>
							<li>✅ trailing lines broken off paragraphs (since pdfminer's <tt>pdf2txt</tt> uses lots of heuristics);</li>
							<li>cross-references which were not parsed correctly;</li>
							<li>incorrectly parsed entries in the index and glossary;</li>
							<li>✅ some (sub)section header are missing, as they were not parsed correctly;</li>
							<li>tables: format-specific;
								<ul>
									<li>✅ tables in the introduction (not particularly pretty)</li>
									<li>appendix tables (not a priority).</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					<dt>5. enhancements 🔧</dt><dd>Routines to enhance the data, such as: detecting more hyperlinks (such as hyperlinks to precise locations in online suttas for tipitaka references). This can be done in parallel with corrections, as it can always be re-run on newer corrected inputs.</dd>
					<dt>6. publication ✨</dt><dd>Final and fine-tuned outputs. Perhaps even an offline app (why not?).</dd>
					<dt>7. beyond ✨</dt><dd>Vimuttimagga? Patisambhidamagga?</dd>

		<h2>How can you help?</h2>
			<p>At this moment, the most useful thing would be to work on the <b>4. corrections</b>. If you spot anything wrong, <a href="https://github.com/eudoxos/vism/issues">file an issue at github</a> or open a pull request with corrected data.</p>
			<p>If you want to work on any of the other points, go ahead and let me know!</p>
		<h2>Output formats</h2>
			<p>Current <a href="https://github.com/eudoxos/vism/blob/06-assemble.ipynb">processing routines</a> spit out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>, <a href="https://sphinx-doc">Sphinx</a> and <a href="https://docbook.org">DocBook</a> based on the source data and are fairly simple.</p>
			<p>The reason for Sphinx was that it has good support for ebooks (ePub and others), but lacks customizations which seem to be important for this kind of book — such as chapters in roman numbers and others.</p>
			<p><a href="https://plastex.github.io/plastex/">PlasTeX</a>'s HTML output if far superior to Sphinx's (and was almost no extra work, as we mostly use vanilla LaTeX with little customizations), but it lacks ePub output.</p>
			<p>DocBook is in decline, XML-FO group was disbanded long time ago.<strike>DocBook (DocBook Publishers for non-technical writing) has many converters to different output formats. Its customization is not straightforward (XSLT stylesheets) but it easy to be automated.</strike></p>
			<p>HTML + CSS for paged media (overview at <a href="print-css.rocks">PrintCSS Rocks</a>; open-source e.g. <a href="https://weasyprint.org">WeasyPrint</a>, <a href="https://vivliostyle.org">Vivliostyle</a>).</p>
			<strike>Perhaps another exporter will have to be created for better ePub version (see <a href="https://standardebooks.org/">Standard Ebooks</a> which sets a good standard; <a href="https://git.matthewbutterick.com/mbutterick/pollen">Pollen</a> create exceptional web books, but seems to be a small and declining project).</strike></p>
