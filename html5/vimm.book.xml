                <span>Owing to an imperfect OCR process, there are typos in the text, especially in the Pali quotes. This is a reader's edition, so those needing the Pali footnotes should check the sources. These quotes might be machine-corrected based on fuzzy matching (e.g. with SuttaCentral data), in the future.</span>

            <span> As stated elsewhere (</span>
            <ptr type="vimm" target="inMemoriam">In Memoriam[PAGE]</ptr>
            <span>) the draft translation of the </span>
            <em>Ci&#233;-to-t&#257;o-lun</em>
            <span> (being the Chinese name for the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span>, rendered as </span>
            <em>Gedatsu D&#333; Ron</em>
            <span> in Japanese) was completed in four months. Therefore it was thought that it needed some revision. This the Venerable Soma Thera intended to do on his return to Ceylon in 1937. But he fell ill and by the end of 1939 the Second World War was already three months old. All hope of publishing the revised edition of the Original Draft Translation during the war had to be given up. With the end of the war, however, conditions were even less favourable. Meanwhile, though the Venerable Soma Thera wished to complete the revision, and await a favourable occasion to publish it, other work he had undertaken prevented him from doing so. Further, asthma robbed him of much, of his time. Thus the work he intended to do on the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span> translation had to be postponed each time he took it up.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>When he passed away many venerable theras and </span>
            <em>d&#257;yakas</em>
            <span> were much interested in publishing, at least, the Original Draft Translation as it was, and they requested me to prepare it for publication. Knowing my own limitations, I was at first rather disinclined to undertake this work, but later acceded to their earnest request for the following reasons.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>The Venerable Soma Thera had originally wished to have the English translation of the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span> (The Path of Freedom) revised and published some day. But later, seeing difficulties, he modified the idea and was even content with merely revising the Draft Translation, leaving the publication itself to some future time. He said that the important thing, the Draft Translation, had been done, and that if people felt that they needed it they would see to its publication.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>It was a work that had inspired both the Venerable Soma Thera and me, and there were many who welcomed its publication.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Dr. D. Roland D. Weerasuria of Balcombe House, Balcombe Place, Colombo, invited the Venerable Soma Thera sometime in 1959 to write an abridged version of the </span>
            <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
            <span> as he felt that such an edition would supply a long felt want. But shortly after he began writing it death intervened. Dr. Weerasuria then requested the Venerable &#209;&#257;&#7751;amoli Thera to take up the work which, after some hesitation, he agreed to finish within a year. But he, too, passed away within a week. Sometime after this Dr. Weerasuria, having seen the Original Draft Translation of the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span>, was keen on its publication.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>This was a fitting occasion to pay a tribute to the memory of the two senior co-translators of the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span>, the Reverend N. R. M. Ehara and the Venerable Soma Mah&#257; Thera.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="33" n="xxxii"/>
            <span> And finally the urgent personal need to keep myself immersed in the </span>
            <em>Dhamma</em>
            <span> throughout the waking hours during this period of stress prompted me to take up the work.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>From the above it will be seen that this work was taken up due to sheer force of circumstances and not because of any special qualification on my part. Therefore, perhaps, some things stated here could have been said in other and better ways. Inexpert as I am in scholarly pursuits there is bound to be many a lack in my portion of this work and so I ask the reader to bear with me should he detect any errors of commission or omission here.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>In preparing this work for printing I have made a few alterations in the rendering of certain terms and passages, as they appeared in the Original Draft Translation, in accordance with notes and instructions left by the Venerable Soma Thera. The lacunae in the Draft Translation were filled, as far as possible, with the help of the word for word translation in consultation with Soma Thera&#8217;s notes. All the longer Pali quotations in the footnotes, except a few from the </span>
            <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
            <span> and some from the </span>
            <em>Dhammasa&#7749;gani</em>
            <span> etc., were inserted by me. They are given in full mainly with the idea of helping the general reader conversant with the Pali but to whom reference books are not easily accessible. By this attempt of mine if but just a few readers happen to be benefitted, to any extent, I should consider myself amply rewarded.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Since the Introduction had already been sent to the Printers by the time the &#8216;Encyclopaedia of Buddhism&#8217; (1961 Government of Ceylon, Fascicule A-Aca) was </span>
            <span>out, the following is included here. In his article, Abhidharma Literature, Dr. K&#333;gen Mizuno makes three statements on page 78 of the Encyclopaedia regarding the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span>: (1) that the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span> (along with the </span>
            <em>Dhammapada</em>
            <span>, the </span>
            <em>A&#7789;&#7789;hakavagga</em>
            <span> of the </span>
            <em>Suttanip&#257;ta</em>
            <span> etc.) &#8220;probably belonged to the Abhayagiri sect and not to the Mah&#257;vih&#257;ra sect&#8221; (paragraph B continued from the previous page); (2) that &#8220;He (i. e., the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera) evidently studied the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span>, which was a manual of the Abhayagirivih&#257;ra sect&#8221; (paragraph c); and (3) &#8220;That the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga,</em>
            <span> was Upatissa&#8217;s work and belonged to the Abhayagirivih&#257;ra sect is mentioned in the &#7789;ik&#257; (sub-commentary, i.e., Dhammap&#257;la&#8217;s Paramatthama&#241;j&#363;s&#257;) of the </span>
            <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
            <span>&#8221; (paragraph c).</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>The first statement, (1) above, says that the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span> &#8220;probably belonged to the Abhayagiri sect&#8221;, while the second, (2) above, says &#8220;</span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span>, which was a manuel of the Abhayagirivih&#257;ra sect&#8221;. How, precisely, did probability in paragraph b became certainty in paragraph c? As for the third statement, (3) above, the </span>
            <em>Paramatthama&#241;j&#363;s&#257;</em>
            <span> does not say that the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span> &#8220;belonged to the Abhayagirivih&#257;ra sect&#8221; as is claimed here. What it says is that the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span> is the work of the Venerable Upatissa Thera. The fact that certain teachings are common to both the Abhayagirivih&#257;ra </span>
            <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="34" n="xxxiii"/>
            <span> and the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span> does not prove that the latter belonged to the Abhayagirivih&#257;ra sect. For details see </span>

            <span>To Mr. W. Joseph Soysa who helped in reading over some of the proofs. He has always been much interested in the </span>

          <span>&#8212; Soma Thera&#8217;s translation in '&#8216;Words Leading to Disenchantment&#8221;, </span>
          <em>Bosat</em>

        <p>
          <span>Truly, indeed, it was not long, after&#8212;just four months since he wrote this article&#8212;that he suddenly passed away. Often he used to say that this was the sort of death, he preferred.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>It is fitting to record here the life and work of the Venerable Soma Mah&#257; Thera, for, but for his indomitable energy and earnestness this work would not have been undertaken, persisted in, and brought to a conclusion in just four months. Whenever any difficulty arose it was to him that the others turned. When we were tempted to give up the work on encountering really hard patches, he was always ready with encouragement and with a way out of the difficulty. He loved to work hard, and half-hearted effort was unknown to him. Not infrequently he used to say, &#8220;Better wear out than rust out&#8221;.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Soma Mah&#257; Thera was born on December 23,1898, in Kotahena, Colombo, and passed away at Vajir&#257;r&#257;ma, Bambalapitiya, Colombo, Tuesday, February 23, 1960. His father was Emmanuel Marian Perera Pulle, and his mother, Theresa Rodrigo Babapulle. His name was Victor Emmanuel Perera Pulle. He received his education at St. Benedict&#8217;s College, Kotahena.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Once at the age of eleven, when he was told by his teacher that God made man, he promptly asked him, &#8220;Who made God?&#8221;. The teacher, apparently unused to this sort of question from his pupils, snapped back, &#8220;Do not question the antecedents of God&#8221;. However, this incident pleased neither the teacher nor the pupil. He began to read and think for himself. One day his mother gave him one rupee as pocket-money, and Victor walked about three miles to a bookshop in the Fort, Colombo, looking out for a book priced at one rupee or less, as that was all he had. Finding an English translation of the Dhammapada being sold for a rupee he quickly bought and read it again and again. This was his introduction to the </span>
          <em>Buddhadhamma</em>
          <span>. From that day on he </span>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="11" n="x"/>
          <span> eagerly attended lectures and sermons on the </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span>, the while reading what literature came his way on philosophy, art, archaeology, history&#8212;in fact anything that would add to his knowledge. And thus he moved further and further away from the faith of his fathers. During these years, as his mother objected to his reading late into the night, he would, after she had gone to sleep, begin reading by candle light under the bed. Sometimes he found that when he had finished reading it was already day. Such was his thirst for knowledge.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Sometime in 1920 he had met Mr. W. Joseph Soysa, one of the founder- members of the Servants of the Buddha, the well-known association which has its headquarters at Lauries Road, Bambalapitiya, and of which the Venerable Kassapa Thera is the founder-patron. After being actively engaged for sometime in the publication of the &#8220;Blessing&#8221; which was edited by the then president of the association, Dr. Cassius A. Pereira, he, along with Mr. Soysa, joined the Colombo Buddhist Union in the early twenties, and presented a large collection of books to the Union library. He composed &#8220;A formula of associate worship&#8221;</span>
          <note n="2" place="foot">
            <p>
              <em>Associate Offering Of Flowers, Incense And Light To The Buddha</em>
              <span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>We have gathered here to pay homage to the Blessed One, who found the way to Happiness for all beings. With these flowers we honour the mainfold purity of the Master; with incense, his compassion; with the light of these lamps, his perfect enlightenment.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>By our joint worship of the Buddha, may we gain the strength to work together in friendliness, sympathising with those in trouble, rejoicing with those who are are fortunate, and avoiding all the evil courses of action, namely, the evil courses of selffish desire, hate, fear and delusion. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Service of the world is the highest homage we can pay to the Buddha, the friend and helper of all beings. Let this act of homage with flowers, incense and light, be the symbol of the homage of service of the world every Buddhist has to fulfil. Let us dedicate ourselves anew today to tread the Path of Service trodden by the Master&#8212;the Path of Charity, Virtue and Clear Thought.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Let remind ourselves now and frequently that the greatest charity is in giving the gift of fearlessness (</span>
              <em>abhaya darn</em>
              <span>) to the world by refraining from killing, stealing, unchastity, lying and drink. Thus we shall be able, to become merciful, honest, chaste, truthful and sober, and make the society in which we live a noble one.</span>

          </note>
          <span> to be used by </span>
          <span>members of the Union at their monthly joint flower-offering at one of the many shrines in the city.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Shortly after this, once again with his equally keen friend Mr. Soysa, he founded the Fort Study Circle and was elected its organizing secretary. Later, as work increased, assistance was needed and Mr. W. Don Michael was elected joint secretary.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>The following extracts are from Mr. Michael&#8217;s article entitled &#8220;Apostle of the Dhamma&#8221;, written on the passing away of Soma Mah&#257; Thera:</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;The sudden death of Soma Thera has uprooted from our midst a personality distinguished at once by the versality of his talents, self-sacrifice, personal sanctity, and crusading apostleship of the </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span>. A deep understanding of human nature and the human problem of suffering had mellowed him and bred in him, in an unusual degree, qualities of tolerance, patience, restraint and sympathy with fellow-beings. Opposition and frustration left in him no sense of defeat or bitterness. He was the working bee in the Master&#8217;s hive and, in His service, the very juice of the bitter thyme turned into honey at his touch. No wonder that, in the Augustan age of Buddhist renascence in Ceylon, Soma Thera was considered to represent the fine flower of Buddhist culture. He shed its fragrance wherever he moved. As scholar, preacher, organiser, monk and friend it may be aptly said of him: &#8220;</span>
          <em>Nihil tetigit quod non ornavit</em>
          <span>&#8221;</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="12" n="xi"/>
          <span> &#8216;These sterling qualities of Soma Thera were happily blended in a character in which humility and service formed the keynote. He never spared himself. He gave till it hurt. He gave UNTO THIS LAST&#8212;unto death. Overwork, fatigue, were the proximate causes of the dire malady which struck down this mighty oak of the </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span> which was a shade and refuge of many a seeker after Truth. Today a void is left standing which may take years to fill.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;To those of us who knew him and enjoyed his friendship and affection for nearly four decades both as the dashing young layman Victor E. P. Pulle, and as a monk of blessed memory, Soma Thera presents a remarkable character study. The child was the father of the man, Thera. Yet in his twenties, he was a rebel from the faith of his fathers and questing for the knowledge of the truth. In the 1930&#8217;s, still hot on the pursuit, he was the leader of a band of young men who formed the Fort Study Circle under the Presidency of Mr. J. Tyagarajah, with Dr. L. A. (now Sir Lalita) Rajapakse and the late Mr. R. Nadarajah as Vice-Presidents.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;Their motto was sacrifice and service and their main object was the economic and cultural development of the country. The regular weekly programme of the Circle, all planned by Victor, included classes in Pali, Hindi, Layman&#8217;s Law, History, Economics and politics. With what resourcefulness, with what prevision of judgement and success, he organised and directed its activities towards the cultural and literary formation of the day are now matters of history...</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;Young Victor&#8217;s reputation for literary and critical scholarship was such that Dr. Lucian De Zilwa prefaced his talk by saying that he accepted the invitation for a lecture with the major- object of making the acquaintance of Mr. V. E. P. Pulle; and Mr. K. P. S. Menon, one of the most graceful and eloquent public speakers this country has ever had, began his lecture by saying that he was always anxious to see the set of young men who could produce an annual report of such literary excellence as that turned out by the Fort Study Circle.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;For Victor Pulle reason was the touchstone of truth. In this quest, he studied comparative religion, logic, philosophy&#8212;Dahlke and Schopenhauer had a particular appeal to him&#8212;art, sculpture, archaeology, history, music and even astrology. Indeed, like Bacon, he took all knowledge for his province. There was not a single </span>
          <span>individual in the Fort of his day who </span>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="13" n="xii"/>
          <span> combined in himself such a vast amalgam of knowledge. Literary and economic studies, however, could not satisfy his ardent mind and he joined the Sangha. It was in this august calling that his scholarship ripened and Buddhist revival throughout the World received from the results of his labour a new life and orientation.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;Meditation, study, teaching the </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span>, canonical research and his own trials and tribulation in the process produced a vast transformation in Soma Thera. The </span>
          <em>&#233;lan</em>
          <span> and impulsiveness of the layman turned into serene calm. The combative debater of yesteryear became the sedate teacher and friendly adviser. The glint of battle which, earlier rose to his eyes when argument waxed high grew into sparks of sympathy and compassion. The chiselled square jaws which hurled challenge softened their contours. Above all, the terrific right fist which characteristically swung menacingly in debate would swing no more. It was obvious even to us his old boon companions to whom he still accorded the privilege of &#8220;ragging&#8221; him once in a way, that this great pioneer and savant, by a terrific ordeal of trial and error, had at last subdued himself and that he had not only found the Middle Path but had established himself so firmly in it that he was a fitting exemplar of his Master&#8217;s Way of Life.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;As a writer, Soma Thera belongs to the </span>
          <em>genre</em>
          <span> whom Buffon&#8217;s dictum &#8220;</span>
          <em>Le style est l&#8217;homme meme</em>
          <span>&#8221; is perfectly applicable. In his Study Circle days, he had a massive style. The exposition and argument would at times be obscured by the weight of movement. He used his pen as a tomahawk. When Carthage had to be destroyed, he made no bones about it but went and destroyed. As a Thera, the old asperity and venom disappeared and the style assumed a precision, clarity, mellowness and gentle movement which reflected the repose and. sureness of his own mind. It is significant that, in recent years, his thoughts turned to poetry. They all centre on the </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span>. One of them recalls so naturally the self-abnegation of the bees in Virgil&#8217;s lines &#8220;</span>
          <em>Sic vos, non vobis, mellificatis, apes</em>
          <span>&#8221;&#8212;not for yourself, ye bees, your cells ye fill&#8212;that the verses &#8220;Giving Up&#8221; deserve quotation&#8217;.</span>

          <span>One day, towards the end of 1928, our common friend, Mr. W. Joseph Soysa (Oliver as we call him), introduced me to Victor. But it was hardly necessary. Simultaneously Victor and I knew that we had been friends before, in an earlier life.</span>
          <note n="2" place="foot">
            <p>
              <span>Since writing this the Ven. Vin&#299;ta Thera of Vajir&#257;r&#257;ma was kind enough to draw my attention to a sonnet in which Lord Tennyson describes how he recognised a friend of an earlier life, thus:</span>
            </p>
            <lg>
              <l>
                <span>&#8220;As when with downcast eyes we muse and brood,</span>
              </l>
              <l>
                <span>And ebb into a former life, or seem</span>
              </l>
              <l>
                <span>To lapse far back in some confused dream</span>
              </l>
              <l>
                <span>To states of mystical similitude;</span>
              </l>
              <l>
                <span>If one but speaks or hems or stirs his chair,</span>
              </l>
              <l>
                <span>Ever the wonder waxeth more and more,</span>
              </l>
              <l>
                <span>So that we say, &#8216;All this hath been before,</span>
              </l>
              <l>
                <span>All this hath been, I know not when or where,</span>
              </l>
              <l>
                <span>So, friend, when first I look'd upon your face,</span>
              </l>
              <l>
                <span>Our thought gave answer each to each, so true&#8212;</span>
              </l>
              <l>
                <span>Opposed mirrors each reflecting each&#8212;</span>
              </l>
              <l>
                <span>That tho&#8217; I knew not in what time or place,</span>
              </l>
              <l>
                <span>Methought that I had often met with you,</span>
              </l>
              <l>
                <span>And either lived in either's heart and speech&#8221;.</span>
              </l>
            </lg>
          </note>
          <span> But we were always grateful to Oliver for this. Later I was happy to find that the Buddha taught that it was not easy to find a being, who, during the vast period of time covered in the process of birth and death, and birth again and death, had not, at one time or another, been a mother, a father, a brother, a sister, a son, a daughter. The Blessed One then asks the question, &#8220;What is the reason for this&#8221;? and himself answers: &#8220;Not to be known is the </span>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="14" n="xiii"/>
          <span> start of beings enmeshed in ignorance and fettered by craving, running on, speeding on through interminable births and deaths. Nor can it be said of the running on and the speeding on of ignorant and craving beings that they are tending to an end. And in this interminable process, for long have you all experienced grief bitter and sharp and made the graveyards bigger and bigger. Because of that you should turn away from the formations (</span>
          <em>sankh&#257;ras</em>
          <span>), cut them off, and become free of them&#8221;&#8212;S. II, 190 (Soma Thera&#8217;s translation). This is no </span>
          <span>poetic fancy, as at first sight it may appear to be. This is the word of the Supremely Enlightened One who has done with poetic fancy. His is the vision of things as they are (</span>
          <em>yath&#257;bh&#363;ta&#241;&#257;a&#7751;dassana</em>
          <span>). And this vision he describes without exaggeration; for exaggeration the Buddhas do not indulge in.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>In the late twenties, Victor and I had heard from the late Mr. Wong Mow Lam, the Chinese scholar, who was in Ceylon for sometime, that there were great possibilities for spreading the </span>
          <em>Therav&#257;da</em>
          <span> in his country and that there was much that could be translated from the </span>
          <em>Mah&#257;y&#257;na</em>
          <span> literature of China. So when we went to Burma in 1934, remembering the words of our scholar friend, we decided after careful thought to go to the Far East and return later to Burma for ordination. We began our journey to China by way of Kawkerik, over the misty Dawna Mountains and across the border for four days on foot to Raehaeng in Thailand, and thence by bus, river boat and train through Svankaloke (Svargaloka&#8212;heaven world), Pisaloke (Vi&#7779;&#7751;uloka &#8212; Vi&#7779;&#7751;u&#8217;s world), we arrived in Krum Teb (Deva Nagara &#8212; the city of the gods) which is Bangkok. Then again, after travelling by train to Penang, and by ship to Singapore and Hong Kong, we arrived in Shanghai. Finding there no facilities for study we proceeded to Tokyo. There we met Prof. Nichiki Kimura of Rissho University, who invited us to attend his English lectures on </span>
          <em>Mah&#257;y&#257;na</em>
          <span>. Towards the end of 1935, through his good offices, we were invited to Jozaiji, the Nichiren temple in Kawatana-Machi, Nagasaki-ken. The head of that temple, the Rev. N. R. M. Ehara, had been a lecturer at Rissho for sometime. He was the perfect host&#8212;a most understanding, patient, pleasant, witty character with abundant laughter, and he was young. He did everything within his power to make our stay as comfortable as possible.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="15" n="xiv"/>
          <span> When we arrived at Kawatana-Machi, Jozaiji was being rebuilt. By the end of April, the building operations over, our host set apart the new guesthouse for our use and called it the Lion Hall, &#8220;in honour&#8221;, as he said, &#8220;of the Lion Isle, the home of my friends&#8221;. We spent a most pleasant and fruitful year in our Lion Hall, for, it was here that the whole of the </span>
          <em>Gedatsu D&#333; Ron</em>
          <span> (the Chinese translation of the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span>) was translated into English for the first time. Perhaps it will not be out of place to mention here that when the late Ven. Ny&#257;&#7751;atiloka Mah&#257; Thera was in Japan during the years that followed the First World War, he tried, but failed, to persuade any Japanese scholar to undertake this translation. So when we sent him a copy of our translation he heartily welcomed it. The word for word translation the draft translation, copying, cyclostyling, binding, packing for the post, were all done by the three of us and that during the brief space of four months. Besides, the section on virtue had to be cyclostyled thrice before Victor was satisfied with it.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>This is how the translation began. Some days after we went into residence in the Lion Hall, our friend showed us around his new library. Pointing to three thin volumes he said that that was the Chinese translation of the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span>, and that originally it was supposed to have been written in Pali in Ceylon by a Sinhalese Thera. With one voice both of us exclaimed that we were ready to begin translating it that very instant,&#8212;of course, with his help. And our friend, with his great big ringing laughter, readily agreed. And we immediately translated the first few pages though he had much to do, it being very close to </span>
          <em>Hanamatsuri</em>
          <span>, the Flower Festival, which corresponds to Vesa&#7731; in </span>
          <em>Therav&#257;da</em>
          <span> lands. Working incessantly we managed to issue the translation of the first fascicle on </span>
          <em>Hanamatsuri</em>
          <span>, May 28, 1936. Continuing to work even up to twenty hours a day sometimes we were able to post the last copy of the last section of the translation to fifty scholars by the last day of September, 1936. During this period Victor knew no fatigue in that most agreeable climate of South Japan.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Jozaiji is beautifully situated a third of the way up the hill which rises abruptly from the broad paddy fields that stretch right up to the sea. In front is the river Kawa, the beauty of which they sing in </span>
          <em>Kawa-no-Kawatana</em>
          <span>, the song of the Kawa of Kawatana. Behind, the hill rises higher and higher and is level at the top. The temple was here in ancient times, and here Victor and I used to stroll under those attractively twisted and gnarled </span>
          <em>su&#241;gi</em>
          <span> trees, the cypresses, that adorn the grounds of Japanese temples. One summer day while walking there our attention was drawn to some plants we seemed to recognize. At first we thought they were well-grown violets. But soon found they were </span>
          <em>go&#7789;ukola</em>
          <span> (</span>
          <em>Hydrocotyle Asiatica</em>
          <span>). Their stalks were nearly eighteen inches long with large leaves. We took a handful of them to the </span>
          <span>temple, and our host was agreeably surprised to hear that this was eaten in Ceylon. He liked it so much that he introduced it to the whole village. They call it horseshoe.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="16" n="xv"/>
          <span> During these four months of translation work the thought that repeatedly arose in our minds was how soon could we return to Burma for ordination and put into practice the teaching of the Sambuddha so clearly set forth in the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span>. It was plain, open, and easy to understand. What it said reached the heart direct &#8212; </span>
          <em>hadayangama</em>
          <span> seemed to be the correct word to describe one&#8217;s reaction on reading the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> for the first time. There was no point in delaying.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>So we left Jozaiji with our friend the Rev. N. R. M. Ehara and a few others, went to Nagasaki and took ship to Rangoon. Our friend was much grieved that we were leaving so soon and repeatedly said as the ship was leaving, &#8216;&#8216;Come back, come back again&#8221;. That was the last time we were to see him. For, though we had hoped some day to see him again, word came shortly after the Second World War that he had suddenly passed away. This was sometime after he had been appointed head of the Nichiren sect for the district of Omura.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Before we decided to translate the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> our host was keen on translating some of the smaller treatises of Nichiren Shonin which Victor did. Some of them were published in the </span>
          <em>Young East</em>
          <span>, the journal of the Japanese Buddhist Associations, Tokyo.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>We reached Moulmein by the end of October, and found that U. Chit Swe, our </span>
          <em>d&#257;yaka</em>
          <span>, had made all arrangements for our ordination in an </span>
          <em>ara&#241;&#241;&#257;v&#257;sa</em>
          <span> (forest residence), as requested by us, and had gone over to India on pilgrimage. His close friend, U. Chit Su, deputised for him. And on November 6, 1936, Victor and I received our higher ordination with the Venerable P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;ava Mah&#257; Thera of Taungwainggyi Shewgyin Kyaung Taik, Moulmein, as teacher. Here we came to hear of the Venerable N&#257;rada Mah&#257; Thera, also known as Jetavana Sayadaw. As he was then living in nearby Thaton, we visited him. A lay pupil of his who had earlier instructed us in the practice of the </span>
          <em>Satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na </em>
          <span>method of meditation, too, accompanied us to see the Sayadaw. His method was strictly in accordance with the </span>
          <em>Satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na Suttas</em>
          <span> of the </span>
          <em>D&#299;gha</em>
          <span> and </span>
          <em>Majjhima Nik&#257;yas</em>
          <span> and their commentaries. He said that the necessary instruction was found in them and no new interpretation was necessary; the Buddha called it the sole way and that there was no other &#8216;sole&#8217; way to the purification of beings.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>On reaching Ceylon by way of India in the middle of 1937, Bhikkhu Soma met a companion of his childhood days who became so attached to him that he would not leave him till his death &#8212; that distressing thing called asthma. It would have rendered many a strong man useless for work quite early. But asthma or no asthma, he worked on and on up to the end with increasing vigour. Hearing that we were returning to Ceylon, a </span>
          <em>d&#257;yaka</em>
          <span>, the late Mr. W. M. Barnes de Silva, had set apart a small house for our use in a quiet place at Belihuloya. We could not stay there long as the Venerable Soma fell ill and had to go to Colombo for treatment and we stayed at the Vidy&#257;lank&#257;ra Oriental College, Kelaniya, for a time.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="17" n="xvi"/>
          <span> After he recovered from his illness, and wishing to live in quiet surroundings for a while, we were able to go into residence at the Mah&#257;nad&#299; &#256;r&#257;ma at Gampolawela, Then at the invitation of the late Sir Baron Jayatilaka we visited Bangalore in 1939 with the Venerable N&#257;r&#257;vila Dhammaratana Mah&#257; Thera, as leader of the Mission of Goodwill to India. There the mission was able to secure from the Government of Mysore a site for a Buddhist Centre, and both of us returned to Ceylon in 1940 owing to illness.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>As Bhikkhu Soma needed rest for sometime, Mr. A. B. C. de Soysa placed his bungalow, in his estate in Kurunegala, at our disposal. After a few months&#8217; stay there we were invited by the Venerable Ny&#257;&#7751;aponika Mah&#257; Thera to the Island Hermitage, Dodanduwa. As the Second World War had begun, all the German Theras of the Hermitage were interned and the Venerable Ny&#257;&#7751;&#257;loka Mah&#257; Thera, the present </span>
          <em>adhipati</em>
          <span> (chief resident Thera) was then in charge of the place. During this period the attacks of asthma were most severe. At one time the only available medicament was Himrod&#8217;s Asthma Cure. It had to be lit with a match and the fumes inhaled. Bhikkhu Soma could hardly walk two yards without this Himrod&#8217;s cure, and could not sleep at night without filling the room with these fumes. One night even this failed to help. So about 2 a.m. he sat at his table and scribbled these verses: </span>

          <span> He lived in this &#8220;our little island home&#8221;, as he liked to call the Hermitage, from 1940-45 and from 1948-54. These were years he treasured much. For it was here that the first edition of </span>
          <em>The Way of Mindfulness</em>
          <span> (1941) and </span>
          <em>His Last Performance</em>
          <span> (1943) were written. He also edited here in 1943 </span>
          <em>&#256;n&#257;p&#257;na Sati</em>
          <span> of Dr. Cassius A. Pereira. In spite of his failing health he wrote unceasingly. He contributed articles to various Buddhist journals regularly. The quiet of the Hermitage appealed to him a great deal. Frequently he sat beneath the trees by the water&#8217;s edge in deep thought, and the following verses might indicate some of the thoughts that occupied his mind then:</span>
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>
            <span>Away against the lip of sea and sky</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>A tiny fisher craft tanned brown by sun,</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>Pops up and down, like monk in russet clout,</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>Upon the choppy sea of doubt and lust.</span>
          </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>
            <span>The tender palms of gold and light green fronds</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>Remind me of my youth and boyhood's days.</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>Amidst their plumy, wavy forms I throve</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>Imbibing nature's simple silent ways.</span>

        <p>
          <span>Once it was thought that his asthma might improve if he had a change and so he stayed at Asok&#257;r&#257;ma in Nuwara Eliya for sometime. There, walking along in Moon Plains once, he was absorbed in the beauty of a waterfall. He used to watch the water rushing down in a silver streak, and very often the asthma left him on those occasions or he forgot it. This tiresome friend, Asthma, has a peculiar trait. He wants attention. And, sometimes, if no attention is paid to him, he sharply retorts in return by paying no attention. These were the times when Soma Thera would say, &#8220;I am thoroughly fit. I can work even the whole day&#8221;, reminiscent of the Lion Hall days when he really worked almost the whole day. It is about this waterfall in Nuwara Eliya that he wrote:</span>
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>
            <span>E'er let me live and die where waters flow</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>From hidden springs on heights that probe the sky,</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>And come to light as white foam falling by</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>The negro face of rocks that shine and glow.</span>
          </l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          <span>Childlikeness was a prominent characteristic of his, and perhaps the following verses illustrate some aspect of it:</span>
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>
            <span>E&#8217;er let me live and die with childlike sight,</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>Beholding elfin gold and jewels bright,</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>And dream-made treasure in the silent night</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>Of travel on and on the Path of Light.</span>

          <span> At the invitation of the late Venerable Tai Tsu, the well known Buddhist leader of China, the Venerable Ma&#7693;ih&#275; Pa&#241;&#241;&#257;s&#299;ha Thera (now Mah&#257; N&#257;yaka Thera), the Venerable Soma Thera, and I, went to China to establish a Pali College at Sianfu, the ancient Buddhist Centre in Shensi Province, the home of Fa Hsien the famous pilgrim. Arriving in Shanghai in early July, we found that fighting had broken out in Shensi between the Nationalist and the Communist forces. There was no possibility </span>
          <span>of proceeding further. The </span>
          <em>Vassa-v&#257;sa</em>
          <span>, the rainy season residence, was spent in Shanghai after which the mission returned. During this period Soma Thera&#8217;s radio sermons were much appreciated. Besides, he addressed many gatherings in various parts of the city. The Shanghai Y.M.B.A. which he founded had, by the time the mission left, nearly three hundred members. He also conducted a Pali class, which was well attended. In November that year the Mission returned to Hong Kong where, too, Soma Thera addressed various groups of Buddhists. Arriving in Singapore in January 1947, the mission had to wait two months for a boat. Meanwhile Soma Thera delivered sermons and lectures to large gatherings both in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. The Mission returned to Ceylon in March that year. Soma Thera returned to the Island Hermitage at the end of 1948 and remained there till 1954. After his return from China, on his initiative, two important Buddhist associations in Colombo, The S&#257;san&#257;dh&#257;ra K&#257;nt&#257; Samitiya and The Banks&#8217; Asoka Society, were formed in 1950 and 1956 respectively. He was the founder-patron of the latter.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>With the approach of the </span>
          <em>Buddha Jayanti</em>
          <span> celebrations, it was suggested that a bi-monthly called &#8216;</span>
          <em>Buddha Jayanti</em>
          <span>&#8217; be published for the duration of these celebrations for the benefit of the English reading public. When in 1953 the organizers came to ask Soma Mah&#257; Thera for his help, he threw himself wholeheartedly into the work, for half-hearted effort was alien to his nature. Most of the editorials on the </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span> in the &#8216;</span>
          <em>Buddha Jayanti</em>
          <span>&#8217; and a large number of translations from the Pali and the German, besides original articles, and the </span>
          <em>Jayanti Miscellany</em>
          <span>, were from his versatile pen. His masterly articles on &#8216;The Greatest Mah&#257;n&#257;yaka Thera of Our Time&#8217; and the editorial &#8216;A Maker of Good Men&#8217; on the passing away of the. Venerable Pael&#257;&#275;n&#275; Siri Vajira&#241;&#257;&#7751;a Mah&#257; N&#257;yaka Thera, were written at a time when he was much harassed by asthma. Finding that the long stay at the Island Hermitage had worsened his asthma and seeing the advantage of being with the Venerable Pael&#257;&#275;n&#275; Siri Vajira&#241;&#257;&#7751;a Mah&#257; N&#257;yaka Thera at Vajir&#257;r&#257;ma with its well equipped library, Soma Thera came to reside once more at Vajir&#257;r&#257;ma. Both the Mah&#257; N&#257;yaka Thera and Soma Thera were happy to meet; for, as far back as 1919, the former had inspired the latter by his great knowledge, understanding, and kindness. Soma Thera&#8217;s regard and respect for him kept on increasing during the years. They used to converse on the </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span> and on allied subjects such as literature, history, grammar, folk-lore, and so on, for hours at a time. The M&#257;ha N&#257;yaka Thera, too, was always ailing, but when both of them began to converse they forgot their </span>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="20" n="xix"/>
          <span> ailments. It might be wondered how it was possible for one to get so interested in such a theme as grammar. But the M&#257;ha N&#257;yaka Thera was such a master of the subject and an accomplished conversationalist that he was able to make even a subject like grammar interesting. I remember in the early thirties how the M&#257;ha N&#257;yaka Thera discoursed on the </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span> to a group of us young men whose leader was Victor. Once the questions put by Victor so interested the M&#257;ha N&#257;yaka Thera that he continued the conversation till three o&#8217;clock in the morning.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>This early earnestness he maintained to the very end. How this long and earnest practice of the </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span> moulded Soma Mah&#257; Thera&#8217;s character is briefly shown in the following extracts from an article by Ceylon&#8217;s Director of Education, Mr. S. F. de Silva: &#8216;I came to know the Venerable Soma Thera as Mr. Victor Pulle some thirty years ago&#8230;. My first impression was of a remarkably earnest man who was determined to seek and find out the Truth. His face was an index to his earnestness and I often listened to him arguing a point&#8230;.We became very good friends and week in and week out I used to watch and realise that of the band that gathered together, he was one of the most earnest and untiring in his study of the </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span>&#8230;. As a member of the Order he became a changed man. I noticed a strength of character and calmness of demeanour in everything he said and wrote. I used to visit him in his room and talk things over many an evening. Occasionally the eye would flash and I could see the old time fighter but there was an unmistakable sense of toleration of others and a remarkable kindliness in everything he said. The Venerable Soma Mah&#257; Thera was very well known to English speaking audiences in the Island. Many may remember his thoughtful talks over Radio Ceylon. I am aware how deeply he was respected by Buddhist students in schools all over the island&#8230;.To me his translation, edition and notes of the </span>
          <em>Satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na Sutta</em>
          <span> is characteristic of the man. He was one who wanted to practise the </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span>, and the </span>
          <em>Satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na Sutta</em>
          <span> was to him &#8216;the one way for the ending of unhappiness&#8217;. I can see his mind in his introductory notes and his interpretations of the text. The Venerable Soma Thera&#8217;s edition of the </span>
          <em>Satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na Sutta</em>
          <span> is a part of his own life because he was one who wanted to practise the </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span>. I miss him very much as a friend but those who knew him have no cause to grieve for a life that had been so nobly spent, He had acquitted himself heroically in all things he did to the&#8230;.end Alert and intensely alive in the search and practice of the Truth, it is of these that the Buddha has said that &#8216;those who are heedful do not die&#8217;. His life is an example to all those who knew him, that there is nothing nobler for a Buddhist than to live the life that the Buddha has preached, to walk the way He had walked and to follow Him on the Noble Quest. May the Venerable Soma Thera attain the Noble Quest he started some forty years ago&#8217;.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>When one happens to be the only person in a powerful group to accept another teaching, much opposition may be expected. This Victor had in </span>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="21" n="xx"/>
          <span> plenty. At these times he resorted to the calm atmosphere of Vajir&#257;r&#257;ma, where the late Venerable Mah&#257; N&#257;yaka Thera and the Venerable N&#257;rada Mah&#257; Thera always found the time to speak with him, sometimes for hours, and he went away stimulated. Later, as a </span>
          <em>bhikkhu</em>
          <span>, when the Venerable Soma, while residing at the Vidy&#257;lank&#257;ra Oriental College, Kelaniya, found that the opposition had grown into hostility, he had the ready sympathy and unstinted support of the late Venerable Lunupokun&#275; Dhamm&#257;nanda N&#257;yaka Thera, the Venerable Kirivattu&#7693;uv&#275; Siri Pa&#241;&#241;&#257;s&#257;ra N&#257;yaka Thera (now Vice-Chancellor) and the other venerable theras of the College. It is also fitting to record here the help readily given by the late Mr. S&#257;gara Palansuriya and Mr. K. M. W. Kuruppu during this difficult period. But both as layman and as monk his attitude to those who were opposed to him, and who later became hostile, was one of kindness and understanding. True follower of the Master, he bore his sufferings without rancour, like the fragrant sandal wood tree which perfumes the axe that lays it low, and like the sugarcane which sweetens the mouth where it is being crushed.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Soma Thera participated in the making of the </span>
          <em>s&#299;m&#257;</em>
          <span>, chapter house, at the Mahabodhi Society&#8217;s Centre in Bangalore during the </span>
          <em>Buddha Jayanti</em>
          <span> celebrations in 1956. Some of the older members of the Buddhist Association there were pleasantly surprised to see him, for this was the site that the Mission of Goodwill had, in 1940, secured from the Government of Mysore for a Buddhist Centre. On his return to Ceylon in early 1957, Soma Thera was invited by the German Dharmad&#363;ta Society to lead the first Buddhist Mission to Germany in June that year, the other members being Vin&#299;ta Thera, Mr. W Joseph Soysa and myself. But though he underwent a serious operation just two weeks before the mission was due to leave, he insisted on not altering the travel arrangements. Actually he went on board ship direct from the hospital. The wound had not healed completely then, and the dressing had to be continued for another five weeks. At the end of this period he could not move his left arm. It was after a further three months&#8217; treatment that he recovered. Yet during all this, time Soma Thera worked with a fortitude which evoked the admiration of all around him. Though the dry climate of Berlin helped his asthma he was not entirely free of attacks. Referring to his fortitude, a friend wrote, &#8220;No other monk except another Soma Thera would have ventured forth on such a mission after the serious operation he had to stand only a couple of weeks before&#8221;.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Yet the work which he had undertaken absorbed all Soma Thera&#8217;s time and attention. He met the leading Buddhists in Berlin, who were anxious to co-operate with the mission&#8217;s work, and soon there began a series of weekly meetings at which Soma Thera read a paper in German which was followed by answering questions that the audience liked to ask. The interpreting at these meetings was done by Mr. F. Knobelock, the then President of the Congress of German Buddhist Associations, or by Mr. Guido Auster. This programme was continued till the mission left Berlin. Meanwhile </span>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="22" n="xxi"/>
          <span> Soma Thera addressed schools in various parts of the city. The children listened to him with the greatest interest. Just before leaving Berlin, the mission received an invitation from the Municipality of Iserlohn to conduct a Meditation Seminar during the &#8220;Indian Week&#8221; which was a part of the &#8216;Sauerland Cultural Season&#8217;. About one hundred people from all walks of life attended it. The late Mr. Egon Vietta was the organiser of the Seminar. On the last day of the Seminar he announced that he had brought a few questions from his teacher, the well-known Existentialist philosopher, Prof. Heidegger, who was ill and unable to travel. When these questions were put to the Yen. Soma Mah&#257; Thera his answers were prompt and so convincing that Mr. Vietta said that these same questions had been put by him to </span>
          <span>European scholars, individually and in groups, but he had not received such satisfying answers as had been given by Soma Mah&#257; Thera.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Another invitation that the mission accepted was that of the Buddhists of Hamburg. They were anxious to have us with them during Vesak time. So from Iserlohn the mission left for Hamburg, where Mr. W. Stegemann, the President of the Buddhist Society of Hamburg, welcomed us. From here, after making a brief visit to London, Oxford, and Cambridge, the mission returned to Hamburg where Soma Thera conducted classes in meditation, and delivered lectures and led discussions on the </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span>. These meetings were well attended. He much liked working among the Hamburg Buddhists because, as he said, they were well informed, organized, and greatly interested in their work as a body. In response to numerous requests, all the addresses delivered in Germany by Soma Mah&#257; Thera were published by the Hamburg Buddhist Society in their Bulletin the </span>
          <em>Mitteilungsblatt</em>
          <span>.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>With all this incessant work and travel Soma Thera grew weak, and when he returned to Ceylon from Germany in June 1958 he was very tired; but with skilful medical attention and another operation he regained his former vigour and worked hard which he loved to do. Then again he fell ill&#8212;this time with renal colic&#8212;and after another spell in hospital he was once more in a fit condition to continue his work. This time he slept hardly four hours a day, from about midnight to 4 a.m. When told that he tired himself overmuch, he used to say, &#8220;I have gathered enough now but I have not time enough to give&#8221;. So he worked on to the end never caring for his health. Yet he was happy doing it.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>He was held in affectionate and highest regard by all those who knew him for his qualities of heart and head. One of them wrote from England thus: &#8220;I was mentioning to the Dons of the Faculty of Eastern Religions at Oxford that there was in Ceylon a monk (referring to Soma Thera) who was eminently qualified by way of knowledge and learning to fill the Chair of Eastern Religions which is now vacant&#8221;. Mr. Guido Auster, the Director of the Oriental Department of the German State Library, Berlin, hearing of his death wrote, &#8220;He contacted many personalities of the religious and intellectual life in Berlin and Germany. He delivered lectures at various places, </span>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="23" n="xxii"/>
          <span> among them&#8212;most important in my opinion&#8212;several to pupils in our schools. He had an especially lucky hand in dealing with children and young people who admired him. He was most patient towards enquirers and beginners&#8221;. Again, he says, &#8220;This impressive personality, reminding me in his dignity of a high prelate during the Middle Ages, weilding not only spiritual but also temporal power, has dissolved&#8221;.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>The President of the Servants of the Buddha, Mr. &#256;nanda Pereira, who, long before his &#8217;teens, knew Soma Thera wrote thus of him in the Ceylon Daily News of February, 27, 1960.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;With the death of the Venerable Soma Thera, Lanka loses one of her noblest sons. Born of Roman Catholic parents on December 23, 1898, duly baptised and brought up in the faith of his parents, the youthful Victor Pulle began asking questions&#8212;deep, simple, direct questions&#8212;the answers to which as given by his parents and spiritual advisors did not satisfy him.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;His inquiries in due course led him to Buddhism, where at last he found the answers, or at least the hope of satisfactory answers to his questions.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;He plunged into the study of the Buddha </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span>. It was at this period that he laid the foundation of that sure grasp of the Teachings that served him so well in later years as a missionary. He was associated with Dr. Cassius A. Pereira (later Ven. Kassapa Thera) in the preparation of the Blessing. He was an-enthusiastic and hard-working member of the Servants of the Buddha. He made many friends.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;Never one to be satisfied with half measures, he was ordained as a Bhikkhu in 1936. From the day he joined the Sangha, he adorned it. As scholar, translator, writer, preacher and missionary, he strove mightily in the Buddhist cause. He never spared himself.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;But those who knew him, will remember him most for his humanity. His was not the cold way of the anaemic academician. He lived his Buddhism with every beat of his warm generous heart. Sometimes he seemed impulsive, sometimes even a shade pugnacious, but never, </span>
          <em>never</em>
          <span>, did he say or do a </span>
          <span> </span>
          <span>mean, false, or deliberately unkind thing.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;He was generous&#8212;with his advice, with his time, with himself. Though to outward appearance he was strong, his health was never particularly robust. But he never let ill-health interfere with his work, and his work was always giving. I have </span>
          <span>seen him preaching sermons or reciting </span>
          <em>Pirith</em>
          <span> at times when the mere act of breathing was acutely difficult because of asthma.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;Soma Thera was a genuine monk. He observed the </span>
          <em>Vinaya</em>
          <span> rules with absolute strictness, never permitting himself the slightest infringement, His standards were the highest. His life was a shining example to others, Bhikkhus and lay-folk alike.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;One does not need to feel sorrow on his behalf. His road is the road of the Buddha, the Arahats, the mighty ones. He lived here a while and has </span>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="24" n="xxiii"/>
          <span> gone on, strong and assured, brave and smiling, kind, gentle, untiring. The story is not done. We too must fare onward when our time comes. We shall meet again&#8217;.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>During the last few months of his life he often spoke and wrote on death, quoting from the </span>
          <em>Suttas</em>
          <span> and other writings, for instance, his own translations from the Sanskrit of Vi&#7779;&#7751;usarman thus:</span>
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>
            <span>In him who ever and again,</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>Reflects on death's hard hand of pain,</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>The drive for gross material gain</span>
          </l>
          <l>

        <p>
          <span>&#8216;I knew the Venerable Soma Mah&#257; Thera intimately for nearly thirty-two years. During this period if the number of days we were absent from each other be added up it will not amount to more than a few months. Yet during all these years our interests centred round the </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span> only. When I met him I knew very little </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span>, having but recently accepted the Teaching of the Buddha. What </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span> I now know was gleaned from him or in his company. So when he passed away suddenly the blow was difficult to bear. Before this event &#8220;the separation&#8221; referred to in the words of the Buddha: </span>
          <em>Piyehi vippayogo dukkho</em>
          <span>, &#8220;the separation from the loved is ill&#8221;, did not seem so difficult a thing to bear. Now it appeared in a different light.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>The passing away of the Venerable S&#257;riputta Thera caused in the Venerable &#256;nanda Thera, who was then only </span>
          <em>Sot&#257;panna</em>
          <span>, Stream-entrant (he became </span>
          <em>Arahat</em>
          <span> later), great agitation of mind, in spite of his having been with the Buddha and learned the </span>
          <em>Dhamma</em>
          <span> from him for twenty-five years. How he served the Buddha during those years is shown in the following verses, beautifully rendered by Mrs. C. A. F. Rhys Davids, thus:</span>

          <span>The following is a description by Soma Thera (</span>
          <em>Bosat</em>
          <span>, October 1959, pp. 170-71) of how the Buddha comforted the Venerable &#256;nanda Thera on this occasion:</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;When the Buddha was told of the passing away of the Venerable S&#257;riputta Thera, who was considered to be the Commander of the Army of Righteousness, the Blessed One said this to the Venerable &#256;nanda Thera, who was upset, &#8220;Tell me &#256;nanda, did S&#257;riputta take the aggregate of virtue along with him and become extinct? Or did he take the aggregate of concentration along with him and become extinct? Or did he take along with him the aggregate of wisdom and become extinct? Or did he take along with him the aggregate of freedom and become extinct? Or did he take along with him the aggregate of the knowledge and insight of freedom and become extinct?&#8217;&#8212;&#8216;No Venerable Sir&#8217;.&#8212;&#8216;Have I not, indeed, told you before that with all that is dear, pleasing, involved are change, separation, and variation?&#8221;</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8216;The Buddha shows that it is not possible to stop the breaking up of what is born, produced, and put together, and of what has the nature of breaking, and compares the Venerable S&#257;riputta Thera to one of the greater branches of the mighty tree of the Community of Bhikkhus. Comparable to the breaking of a bigger branch of a mighty tree, says the Buddha, is the Venerable S&#257;riputta Thera&#8217;s passing away and no one can stop the breaking of what is breakable by ordering that thing not to break&#8217;.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>But when this peerless comforter, the Blessed One himself, passed away </span>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="26" n="xxv"/>
          <span> shortly afterwards the Venerable &#256;nanda Thera uttered the following verses:</span>
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>
            <span>And is the comrade passed away,</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>And is the Master gone from hence?</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>No better friend is left, methinks,</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>Than to mount guard o&#8217;er deed and sense.</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>They of the older time are gone;</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>The new men suit me not at all.</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>Alone to-day this child doth brood,</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>Like nesting-bird when rain doth fall.</span>

          <span> In the Journal of the Pali Text Society of 1919, there appeared an article by Prof. Dr. M. Nagai on &#8220;The Vimutti-Magga, &#8216;The Way to Deliverance&#8217; &#8221;. Referring to it Mrs. C. A. F. Rhys Davids in a letter dated September 20, 1936 to the translators of the </span>
          <em>Gedatsu D&#333; Ron</em>
          <span> (</span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span>) said, &#8220;Then as to the issuing of the book (referring to the Path of Freedom) in a volume of print: Were this society in easier circumstances enjoyed by it up to the Great War, when we were immensely helped by the princely donations of your wealthy men, I would undertake at once to publish the work with Prof. Nagai&#8217;s excellent article in our Journal, 1919, as preface, with anything he liked to add. Or, if you objected, I should ask you three to write your own preface, making such references to his article as you thought fit&#8221;.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>This article of Prof. Nagai took the Buddhist world by surprise; for, according to the </span>
          <em>C&#363;lava&#7745;sa</em>
          <span> chapter XXXVII, 236-39, when the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera had written the </span>
          <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
          <span> at the behest of the </span>
          <em>Mah&#257;sangha</em>
          <span>, the </span>
          <em>devas</em>
          <span> had hidden it and he had to write it afresh. When this was done, it too was hidden by the </span>
          <em>devas</em>
          <span>. So, when he wrote it for the third time and presented it to the </span>
          <em>Mah&#257;sangha</em>
          <span>, it is said, the </span>
          <em>devas</em>
          <span> produced the first two copies. It was then found that the three copies agreed in every detail. The record goes on to say (</span>
          <ptr type="bib" target="Cv." loc=" Ch. XXXVII, 241-43">Cv. Ch. XXXVII, 241-43</ptr>
          <span>): &#8216;Then the bhikkhus read out all the three books together. Neither in composition and content, nor also as regards the sequence (of the subjects), in the teaching of the Theras, in the quotations, in words, and sentences was there any kind of deviation in all three books. Then the community satisfied and exceedingly well pleased, cried again and again: &#8220;without doubt, this is Metteyya!&#8221; and handed over to him the books of the three Pi&#7789;akas together with the commentary&#8217; &#8212; Dr. Geiger&#8217;s translation. By this statement it was, perhaps, only intended to stress the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera&#8217;s great ability, which is amply borne out by this (i.e., the </span>
          <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
          <span>) and his later works. No other view seems to be warranted, or else it has to be conceded that the Mah&#257;vih&#257;ra Theras knew very well that the Bodhisatta Metteyya could not have been born in this world at this time; &#8212; see, for instance, the earlier statement of the </span>
          <em>Mah&#257;va&#7745;sa</em>
          <span> at </span>
          <ptr type="bib" target="Mv." loc=" ch. XXXII, 73">Mv. ch. XXXII, 73</ptr>
          <span>: &#8216;Awaiting the time when he shall become a Buddha, the compassionate Bodhisatta Metteyya dwells in the Tusita-city&#8217;&#8212; Dr. Geiger&#8217;s translation. Further, that the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera and the Bodhisatta Metteyya are two different persons has been established by the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera himself in his Postscript to the </span>
          <em>Visuddhimagga</em>

          <span> And this, too, the Mah&#257;vih&#257;ra Theras would have known. But in thus stressing his ability, the </span>
          <em>C&#363;&#7735;ava&#7745;sa</em>
          <span> account seems to make out that the </span>
          <em>visuddhi-magga</em>
          <span> was written without recourse to other works. There is a discrepancy in this account of the </span>
          <em>C&#363;&#7735;ava&#7745;sa.</em>
          <span> It will be noted that &#8216;the three </span>
          <em>Pi&#7789;akas</em>
          <span> together with Commentary&#8217; were handed over to the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera by the Mah&#257;sangha only after he had written the </span>
          <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
          <span>, which is correctly designated the General Commentary to the three </span>
          <em>Pi&#7789;akas</em>
          <span>. Now, if he had access to the three </span>
          <em>Pi&#7789;akas</em>
          <span>, and the Commentary only after he had written this General Commentary to the three </span>
          <em>Pi&#7789;akas</em>
          <span>, how did he do it? This is difficult to comprehend. Here is where the article of Prof. Dr. Nagai appears to fit in.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Bearing No. 1293 in Prof. Nanjio&#8217;s Catalogue is a work in Chinese called </span>
          <em>Ci&#233;-to-t&#257;o-lun</em>
          <span> (in Japanese rendered as </span>
          <em>Gedatsu D&#333; Ron</em>
          <span>). </span>
          <span> </span>
          <span>Prof. Nanjio has rendered the title of this work in Sanskrit as &#8216;Vimok&#7779;a-M&#257;rga&#8217;, the author being Arahant Upatissa. In trying to identify him with a Ceylon Thera, Prof. Nagai adduces the following reasons:</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>1. </span>
          <span> </span>
          <span>It cannot be the Venerable S&#257;riputta Thera, who was also called Upatissa, because he is often quoted in the Venerable Upatissa Thera&#8217;s text.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>2. </span>
          <span> </span>
          <span>In the </span>
          <em>Samantap&#257;s&#257;dik&#257;</em>
          <span> (I, p. 263), it is said that there were two elders, named Upatissa Thera and Phussadeva Thera, pupils of the same teacher who was proficient in the </span>
          <em>Vinaya</em>
          <span>. Upatissa Thera was superior to the other; and he had two pupils named Mah&#257;paduma Thera and Mah&#257;sumana Thera. The latter learned the </span>
          <em>Vinaya Pi&#7789;aka</em>
          <span> nine times from his teacher, while Mah&#257;paduma Thera learned it eighteen times and was, therefore, the superior. When the former left his teacher to live elsewhere Mah&#257;paduma Thera remained with his teacher saying that as long as one&#8217;s teacher was alive one should be with him and learn the </span>
          <em>Vinaya</em>
          <span> and the Commentaries many times more. The teacher, the Venerable Upatissa Thera, and his pupil the Venerable Mah&#257;paduma Thera, recited the </span>
          <em>Vinaya</em>
          <span> in this manner for many years more. During this period they expounded the </span>
          <em>Vinaya</em>
          <span> and on one occasion the Venerable Upatissa Thera, at the request of the Mah&#257;sangha in assembly, pronounced a ruling on a question that arose regarding the first </span>
          <em>P&#257;r&#257;jika</em>
          <span>.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>3. </span>
          <span> </span>
          <span>A teacher such as the Venerable Upatissa Thera was the most appropriate person to be the author of a work of such importance as the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span>. Then he goes on to mention the account of the gift of King Vasabha&#8217;s queen to the Venerable Mah&#257;paduma Thera who accepted it as his teacher&#8217;s share.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>4. </span>
          <span> </span>
          <span>To show that the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera was aware of the existence of the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span>, Prof. Nagai refers to the comments of the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera regarding the &#8220;fourteen </span>
          <em>cariya</em>
          <span>'s&#8221; of the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span>.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>It is quite probable that the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera had the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> in mind when he made this comment; for there is the definite statement of the Venerable Dhammap&#257;la Thera in his commentary to the </span>
          <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
          <span> (</span>
          <em>Paramatthama&#241;j&#363;s&#257;</em>
          <span>, Venerable Morontu&#7693;uv&#275; Dhamm&#257;nanda N&#257;yake Thera&#8217;s Sinhalese ed. p. 103) which says: </span>
          <em>Ekacce ti Upatissatthera&#7745; sandh&#257;y&#257;ha. Tena hi Vimuttimagge tath&#257; vutta&#7745;,</em>
          <span>&#8212;&#8220;&#8216;Some&#8217; is said with reference to the Venerable Upatissa Thera. It is said thus by him in the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span>&#8221;. From the foregoing it is clear that the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera had the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> of Venerable Upatissa Thera before him when he wrote the </span>
          <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
          <span>.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="38" n="xxxvii"/>
          <span> In his Pali Literature of Ceylon, Dr. G. P. Malalasekera has this to say on the subject:</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>(a) &#8220;The </span>
          <em>Vimutti-magga</em>
          <span> is an Abhidhamma exegesis, serving as a compendium for that portion of Buddhist literature . . . , and in some points the Chinese work seems to have been influenced by the Mah&#257;y&#257;na doctrine&#8221; (p. 86).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>(b) He says, further, that if it is granted that the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> was taken to China by some of the schools of approximately the same tradition, &#8220;it would not be difficult to conclude that the </span>
          <em>Visuddhi-magga</em>
          <span> and </span>
          <em>Vimutti-magga </em>
          <span>are more or less independent works, written by men belonging to much the same school of thought &#8212; the </span>
          <em>Thera-v&#257;da</em>
          <span>&#8221; (pp. 87-88).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Regarding the statement (a) above, it will be seen that very little </span>
          <em>Abhidhamma</em>
          <span> is found in the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span>, though of course, it begins by saying that he who wishes to &#8220;lead those on the other shore to perfection, should be versed in the </span>
          <em>Sutta</em>
          <span>, </span>
          <em>Abhidhamma</em>
          <span> and </span>
          <em>Vinaya</em>
          <span>&#8221;. Here, the late Venerable &#209;&#257;&#7751;amoli Thera&#8217;s opinion on the subject will be of interest: &#8220;However the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> itself contains nothing at all of the Mahayana, its unorthodoxies being well within the &#8216;Hinayana&#8217; field&#8221;. Again he says: &#8220;Also Abhidhamma, which is the keystone of Bhadant&#257;cariya Buddhaghosa&#8217;s exegesis, is not used at all in the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> (Aggregates, Truths, etc., do not </span>
          <em>in themselves</em>
          <span> constitute Abhidhamma in the sense of that Pitaka). There is, for instance, even in its description of the Consciousness Aggregate, no reference to the </span>
          <em>Dhammasa&#7749;ga&#7751;&#299;</em>
          <span>&#8217;s classification of 89 types, and nothing from the </span>
          <em>Pa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na</em>
          <span>; and though the &#8216;Cognitive Series&#8217; is stated once in its full form (in Ch. II) no use is made of it to explain conscious workings. This </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> is in fact a book of practical instruction, not of exegesis&#8221; (</span>
          <span>Path of Purification Introduction</span>
          <span> pp. xxvii-xxviii). The statement of the Venerable Dhammap&#257;la Thera in the </span>
          <em>Paramatthama&#241;j&#363;s&#257;</em>
          <span> quoted earlier seems to disallow (b) above.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>The Venerable Buddhadatta Mah&#257; N&#257;yaka Thera in the Pali Text Society&#8217;s edition of the </span>
          <em>Saddhammappajotik&#257;</em>
          <span> refers to Prof. Nagai&#8217;s view that the author of the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> was the Venerable Upatissa Thera who flourished during King Vasabha&#8217;s reign, 66-109 A. C. He says, &#8220;However, there is no such great difference as cannot be bridged between his supposition and mine&#8221; (Introduction p. VIII).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <anchor id="intro-abhayagiri"/>
          <span>Regarding the view that the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> was a work written at the Abhayagiri Monastery, the late Venerable &#209;&#257;&#7751;amoli Thera rightly says, &#8220;That it (the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span>) contains some minor points accepted by the Abhayagiri Monastery does not necessarily imply that it had any special connection with that centre. The sources may have been common to both. The disputed points are not schismatical. Bhadant&#257;cariya Buddhaghosa himself never mentions it&#8221; (Introduction, XXVIII).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Prof. Dr. P. V. Bapat in the Introduction (</span>
          <ptr type="bib" target="Vim. Mag. and Vis. Mag." loc=", p. liv">Vim. Mag. and Vis. Mag., p. liv</ptr>
          <span>) to his careful work &#8220;Vimuttimagga and Visuddhimagga, A Comparative Study&#8221; (1937), has examined a great deal of material. In support of his theory that the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> originated in India, he puts forward, among others, the following reasons (</span>
          <ptr type="bib" target="Vim. Mag. and Vis. Mag." loc=", p. liv">Vim. Mag. and Vis. Mag., p. liv</ptr>
          <span>): (a) &#8220;It is very likely that Vimuttimagga was one of the books brought over from India. From the internal evidence of the book we may say that there is no reference to any name</span>
          <note n="1" place="foot">
            <p>
              <span>&#8220;Unless the name N&#257;rada (p. 134) referred to any high personage from Ceylon, which seems to be very improbable&#8221;. This name is found at S. II, 117-18. See p. 321.</span>
            </p>
          </note>
          <span> or place in Ceylon&#8221;. If the view of </span>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="39" n="xxxviii"/>
          <span> the late Venerable &#209;&#257;&#7751;amoli Thera, that the &#8220;</span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> is in fact a book of practical instruction, not of exegesis&#8221; &#8212; which is also the view of the late Venerable Soma Thera and myself &#8212; is accepted, and if it is recognized that the whole style of the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> makes for brevity &#8212; it is even abrupt sometimes &#8212;, then it will be seen that the exclusion of any &#8216;name or place in Ceylon&#8217; is not surprising.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>(b) &#8220;We find in this book many words which are transliterations of Indian words. The list of worms residing in different parts of the body gives names which are transliterations of Indian names. These names must have been taken by Upatissa from some old work or works on medical science&#8221; (p. liv). This is as it should be, seeing that the Dhamma is of Indian origin, and when medicine or anything related to medical science is mentioned it is natural for Ceylon writers to use Indian terms: for what medical knowledge Ceylon possessed at the time was of Indian origin. The standard Ayurvedic medical works in use even now are Su&#347;ruta and V&#257;gbhata. Caraka is not unknown.</span>
          <note n="2" place="foot">
            <p>
              <span>* Since writing the above the </span>
              <em>Caraka Sa&#7745;hit&#257;</em>
              <span> has been translated into Sinhalese by &#256;yurveda S&#257;stri R. Buddhad&#257;sa, Colombo.</span>
            </p>
          </note>
          <span> The first two works have been in use in Ceylon through the ages. But if the list of worms is not derived from the first two works or one of them, then the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> most probably bases itself here on some other medical work of Indian origin known in Ceylon at the time.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Regarding the statement, &#8220;We find Upatissa going into the details of the development of the foetus week by week&#8221; (p. lvi), it will be seen from </span>
          <ptr type="vimm" target="p173n3">note 3[PAGE]</ptr>
          <span> that here the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> follows the </span>
          <em>Sutta</em>
          <span> and its commentary.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>(c) &#8220;Besides, the reference to a </span>
          <em>Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span>, which we have already noticed, also points to the origin of the book in India,</span>
          <note n="1" place="foot">
            <p>

            </p>
          </note>
          <span> particularly, in South or Dravidian India where there is a very strong prejudice against Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;las&#8221; (</span>
          <ptr type="bib" target="Vim. Mag. and Vis. Mag." loc=", p. liv">Vim. Mag. and Vis. Mag., p. liv</ptr>

          <em>Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;las</em>
          <span> are found elsewhere, in the texts and commentaries. For instance, as pointed out by Prof. Bapat himself (</span>
          <ptr type="bib" target="Vim. Mag. and Vis. Mag." loc=", p. xlvi">Vim. Mag. and Vis. Mag., p. xlvi</ptr>

          <span>, </span>
          <em>ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span> is mentioned. Here it should be borne in mind that in the society of the time, and also later, the </span>
          <em>ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span> was a person looked down upon. To illustrate certain points in a way that the large mass of the people would understand, appropriate similes were used by the Buddha and his Disciples, and the commentators who came after them. It does not mean that they thereby endorsed some of the statements made in their similes. For instance, when the Buddha, in the </span>
          <em>Satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na Suttas</em>
          <span>, says, &#8220;Just as if a clever butcher or butcher&#8217;s apprentice, having slaughtered a cow and divided it into portions were sitting at the main cross-road,&#8221; and so on, it does not follow that the Buddha upheld the butchers&#8217; profession. If the word </span>
          <em>ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span> was used in a simile, the motive behind it was nothing else than to facilitate the understanding of the point under discussion. The upholding of the caste system does not come in here. On the contrary, the Buddha and his disciples were opposed to it as we see in the use of the word </span>
          <em>ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span> in a different context referring to an </span>
          <em>up&#257;saka</em>
          <span> (i.e., one who has gone to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha for refuge) but who does not observe the </span>
          <em>silas</em>
          <span> etc. &#8212; he being called </span>
          <em>up&#257;sakaca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span> (</span>
          <ptr type="bib" target="A." loc=" III, 206">A. III, 206</ptr>
          <span>). The </span>
          <em>Vasala Sutta</em>
          <span> (</span>
          <ptr type="bib" target="Sn." loc=" 116-42">Sn. 116-42</ptr>
          <span>) may also be mentioned here. Further, these sentences occur in the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> itself, thus: &#8220;Virtue is called excellent joy, the highest of all castes . . . This is to </span>

          <span> wear the thread which must be worn. This is the sacred caste&#8221; (p. 8).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>What has largely prompted Prof. Bapat to protest seems to be the statement found in Chapter m dealing with the Austerities, and his objection runs thus: &#8220;Let us note one peculiar fact about Upatissa. He seems to have some kind of contempt for, or low opinion of, a </span>
          <em>Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span>&#8221; (p. xlvi). Then on the same page he goes on to say the following, which are possibly the reasons for the statement mentioned above.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>(1) &#8220;In one place, there is a reference to a </span>
          <em>Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span> where we are told in a simile that he has no desire for a princely throne&#8221; (p. xlvi). The relevant passage is, &#8220;As an outcast has no desire for a king&#8217;s throne&#8221; (p. 25 of the present translation). The same idea is found in the </span>
          <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
          <span> too, namely, &#8220;</span>
          <em>Nir&#257;so saddhamme ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;lakum&#257;rako viya rajje</em>
          <span>&#8221; (p. 54) &#8212; &#8220;He is desireless for the Good Law as a </span>
          <em>ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span> (outcast) is for a kingdom&#8221;. It is therefore not a statement peculiar to the Venerable Upatissa Thera.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>(2) With regard to the next objection: &#8220;At another place, to see a </span>
          <em>Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span> on the way is considered to be a sufficient reason for the laxity in the observance of the practice of </span>
          <em>sapad&#257;na-c&#257;rik&#257;</em>
          <span> (going from house to house in succession for begging one&#8217;s food)&#8221; (p. xlvi). This is not quite what the text says, as will be seen later. There is no question of laxity. Then the next sentence continues, &#8220;Upatissa says that if a mendicant sees a </span>
          <em>Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span> on the way, he should cover his begging-bowl and may skip over some houses and go further. In the third place we find a lack of conscientiousness (</span>
          <em>ahirika</em>
          <span>) is compared to a </span>
          <em>Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span>&#8221; (pp. xlvi-xlvii). Further, at p. 23, &#8220;Even if he has taken up the practice of a </span>
          <em>sapad&#257;nac&#257;rika</em>
          <span>, he should avoid elephants or horses that may be coming in his way. Seeing a </span>
          <em>Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span>, he should cover his begging- bowl. &#8216;Following one&#8217;s </span>
          <em>&#257;cariya</em>
          <span> or </span>
          <em>upajjh&#257;ya</em>
          <span>&#8217; is also mentioned as an occasion for exception&#8221;. Here is the relevant passage from the present translation (p. 36): &#8220;What is the teaching as regards expedience in the observance of &#8216;regular almsround&#8217;? If a bhikkhu on seeing elephants or horses fighting or in rut, at the gate, avoids them, or on seeing an outcast (</span>
          <em>ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span>, transliteration) covers his bowl, or goes behind his preceptor, teacher or a visiting bhikkhu, and thus commits certain faults for expedience&#8217; sake, he does not fail in &#8216;regular almsround&#8217; &#8221;.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Now let us consider why the expedience in regard to elephants and horses may be resorted to. It is plain that it is to avoid being hurt or even killed. Regarding the preceptor or teacher &#8212; it is out of respect due to them. It is an offence not to do so. Again, covering the bowl on seeing a </span>
          <em>ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span> is for self-protection. The society at that time was very much caste-conscious. If the people objected to, or did not favour, the receiving of alms from one they considered an outcast, the support from the large majority of the people would be liable to be withdrawn and the life of the bhikkhu rendered difficult, to say the least. Here the story of the son and heir of the King Du&#7789;&#7789;hag&#257;ma&#7751;i comes readily to mind. It is said that the people were prosperous and happy during his reign and that he had a son named S&#257;lir&#257;jakum&#257;ra, concerning whom the following is recorded.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>&#8220;Greatly gifted was he and ever took delight in works of merit; he tenderly loved a ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la woman of exceedingly great beauty. Since he was greatly enamoured of the Asokam&#257;l&#257;devi, who already in a former birth had been his consort, because of her loveliness, he cared nothing for kingly rule&#8221; (</span>
          <ptr type="bib" target="Mv." loc=" Ch. XXXILL, 2-4">Mv. Ch. XXXILL, 2-4</ptr>
          <span>). Therefore King Du&#7789;&#7789;hag&#257;ma&#7751;i, after his death, was succeeded by his brother, Saddh&#257;tissa, who reigned for eighteen years.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="41" n="xl"/>
          <span> &#8220;He cared nothing for kingly rule&#8221;, &#8212; </span>
          <em>So rajja&#7745; neva k&#257;mayi</em>
          <span>. Surely there is something similar in this statement and the simile which is common to both the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> and the </span>
          <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
          <span>, namely, </span>
          <em>Nir&#257;so saddhamme ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;lakum&#257;rako viya rajje</em>
          <span>; &#8212; </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> p. 25: He has no desire for the Noble (Law), as an outcast has no desire for a king&#8217;s throne&#8221;; </span>
          <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
          <span> p. 54: &#8220;He is desireless for the Good Law as an outcast (</span>
          <em>ca&#7751;&#7693;&#257;la</em>
          <span>) is for a kingdom&#8221;! Have not both the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> and the </span>
          <em>Visuddhimagga </em>
          <span>been making some sort of allusion to this event, which would, no doubt, have shocked the whole land? Might it not seem that here was an actual story well-known in the land and even recent history as far as the Venerable Upatissa Thera of King Vasabha's reign was concerned (King Du&#7789;&#7789;hag&#257;ma&#7751;i reigned from 161-137 B.C. and King Vasabha from 66-110 A.C.)? If our author is in fact this Upatissa Thera, this story will provide him with the most appropriate material for a simile to illustrate the regardlessness of an unvirtuous man for the Good Law. How appropriate the background provided by the prince&#8217;s story is for purposes of the simile, which was perhaps even inspired by it, can be seen from </span>

          <span> &#8220;reveals no special mastery of the Vinaya which is claimed by Prof. Nagai for that Upatissa who lived in the first century A.D. in Ceylon&#8221; (p. lvi), the </span>
          <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
          <span> is hardly the place to display such special knowledge.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Finally, to this following statement: &#8220;My discovery of the Tibetan version of the third chapter on &#8216;</span>
          <em>dhutas</em>
          <span>&#8217; is also important. . . This Tibetan text provides an additional evidence to show the Indian origin of the book. It does not appear to be probable that a text from Ceylon was taken over to India and there it was studied in Buddhist schools and that it assumed such importance as to be translated, in part at east, in Tibetan&#8221; (pp. liv-lv). An article which the late Lama Geshe La Gedum </span>
          <span>Chomphell originally contributed </span>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="42" n="xli"/>
          <span> to </span>
          <em>The Buddhist</em>
          <span>, the journal of the Y.M.B.A., Colombo, and which was reprinted in the </span>
          <em>Buddha Jayanti</em>
          <span> of July 22, 1956, begins &#8212; &#8216;The horse of Buddhism is dead in India; only the tops of the horse&#8217;s ears are still visible in the east and the west of the land&#8217;. This saying which had gained currency in Tibet once, perhaps originated with the monk Vanaratana, known, in Tibetan history, as the last great Indian </span>
          <em>Mah&#257;pa&#7751;&#7693;ita</em>
          <span> who came to live and teach in Tibet. A native of Bengal, he was ordained young, as a </span>
          <em>s&#257;ma&#7751;era</em>
          <span>, in a monastery of one thousand monks. He received full ordination in Ceylon, with two well-known Theras, the Venerable Buddhaghosa and the Venerable Dhammakitti as preceptor and teacher respectively. He studied the </span>
          <em>Vinaya Prabh&#257;</em>
          <span> (Splendour of the Discipline), a </span>
          <em>Sarv&#257;stiv&#257;da</em>
          <span> work. Then he returned to his native country and, after studying the </span>
          <em>K&#257;lacakra</em>
          <span>, went to Tibet by way of Assam. The Lama says: &#8220;During the journey he is believed to have remembered his Sinhalese preceptor, and inscribed on a wayside rock these words: &#8216;I salute Buddhaghosa the teacher of thousands of beings&#8217; &#8221;. And he says further that in the middle of the seventeenth century the lama king of Bhutan, when at war with the Central Tibet government, had seen and mentioned it in one of his writings. On reaching Tibet his interpreter died, and so after a short stay there he returned to Bengal. &#8220;Vanaratana&#8217;s second visit to Ceylon lasted six years; during that time he studied all branches of Buddhism&#8221;, says the lama. The Venerable Vanaratana in his account of a pilgrimage he made to &#346;r&#299; Pad&#257; in Ceylon states that he received two bone relics there. Then again the lama goes on to say, &#8220;With the relics and some books he had collected, Vanaratana returned to his country and not long afterwards reentered Tibet. This time he was able to speak Tibetan well; he made many lamas his disciples through his preaching. The chief of Vanaratana&#8217;s disciples was Rong-Thong-Pa, the founder of a new sect; to him Vanaratana gave one of the relics he had got in Ceylon. Rong-Thong-Pa built near Lhasa a monastery called N&#257;land&#257;&#8221;. The Venerable Vanaratana died fifteen years after he re-entered Tibet &#8220;at a monastery in Singpori in Tsang province; his tomb can still be seen in that monastery . . . The full admission of Vanaratana to the Sangha by Ceylon theras, and the long stay here, point to the existence of cordial relations between the Indian and Ceylon Sangha of his time. Tibetan books show that Ratn&#257;kara Gupta of Vikrama&#7777;&#299;la stayed in Ceylon for seven years on his way to Dhanyaka&#7789;aka; and At&#299;&#7777;a (D&#299;pa&#7745;kara &#346;r&#299; J&#241;&#257;na), who became abbot of Vikrama&#7777;&#299;la, was here in the eleventh century&#8221;. Further, I myself remember the late lama, when he was preparing this article, mentioning to the Venerable Soma Thera that he had seen in a monastery in Tibet a Sinhalese manuscript which, he said, probably dated back to the Venerable Vanaratana Thera&#8217;s time.</span>
          <note n="1" place="foot">
            <p>
              <span>Since writing the above, the Ceylon Daily News reported, in its issue of September 9, 1960, of the discovery of a Singhalese manuscript in a Buddhist monastery of Saiskya in Tibet by Prof. R&#257;hula Sankrity&#257;yana of the Vidy&#257;lank&#257;ra University, Kelaniya, in the years between 1929 and 1938.

          <span>In view of the above we are entitled to say that, while it is not proved that the </span>

          <span> was written in Ceylon, it has been shown that the very reasons put forward to support the view that it must have been written in India, support equally well the view that it may well have been written in Ceylon. To this can be added the idea that the simile of the outcast having no desire for a king&#8217;s throne, possibly drew inspiration from the story of S&#257;lir&#257;jakum&#257;ra, which must certainly have been current at the time, though </span>

          <em>Mah&#257;va&#7745;sa</em>

X). He further says, &#8220;The chronicle must originally have come down only to the arrival of Mahinda in Ceylon. But it was continued later, and indeed to all appearance, down to the reign of Mah&#257;sena (beginning of the fourth century A.D.)&#8221;.</span>

            <em>&#7777;rama&#7751;a</em>
            <span> of India and studied </span>
            <em>Vaipulya</em>
            <span> under him. Sanghap&#257;la&#8217;s knowledge was wide and deep and he was conversant with the languages and books of several countries . . . P&#257;la was clean of body and of mind and was reluctant to engage in conversation. In the seclusion of his room he stayed and worked, taking very simple fare.</span>

            <span>In the 5th year of Tenkwan, he was offered by the emperor these five places of residence: Jukoden, Karinenden (Flower-forest-garden), Sh&#333;kwanji Senunkwan and Fun&#257;nkwan of the Capital Yoto (Sun City). He translated for seventeen years. His translations amounted to eleven cases of forty-eight fascicles. They are the great </span>

            <em>Vimok&#7779;a-M&#257;rga-&#7777;&#257;stra</em>
            <span> and others. When the translations began the Emperor B&#363; himself came to Jukoden, attended the exposition of the Law by Sanghap&#257;la and himself wrote (down the translations). After that he handed them over to the writer who was to make the printing blocks, The emperor commanded the </span>

            <span> Sochi to assist Sanghap&#257;la. His translations were in elegant Chinese and faithful to the original. The emperor treated him most cordially and respectfully and made him the court chaplain. It is said that he altered many customs of the people. P&#257;la did not hoard treasure. With offerings that were made to him P&#257;la built the Ryuj&#363;ji (&#256;rabdha-v&#299;ry&#257;r&#257;ma). The minister Rinsenoko was deeply attached to him. In the fifth year of Futsu, he died at Sh&#333;kwanji. He was sixty five years old.</span>

            <span>Much has been written about the </span>
            <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
            <span> from the earliest times right down to the present day. King Par&#257;krama-B&#257;hu II (1236-68 A.C.) is reported to have written the paraphrase to the </span>
            <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
            <span> after he had handed over the kingdom to his son Bodhisatta Vijaya-B&#257;hu (1271-72 A.C.). During the last century Pandit M. Dharmaratna revised this work. Of him and his work on the Visuddhimagga, the Venerable Soma Thera wrote in the </span>
            <em>Buddha Jayanti</em>
            <span> of April 5, 1955 thus: &#8220;Had he not written any of the works mentioned above and not edited the paper, still people of this country would have been obliged to remember him for his great gift of the translation of the </span>
            <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
            <span>, with his edition of the </span>

            <em>Visuddhi</em>
            <span> by Par&#257;krama-B&#257;hu II, a comprehensive work which is of never-failing interest and great usefulness to all students of the Dhamma and the Sinhalese language&#8221;. Then again there is the late </span>

There is also the English translation of the Pali Text Society by Prof. Pe Maung Tin of Rangoon, completed in 1931, and that of the late Venerable &#209;&#257;&#7751;amoli Thera of the Island Hermitage, Dodanduwa in 1956. The German translation is by the late Venerable Ny&#257;&#7751;atiloka Mah&#257; Thera, founder of the Island Hermitage, Dodanduwa, the publishers being Verlag Christiani, Konstanz, 1952.</span>

            <span>The </span>
            <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
            <span> is a household word in all </span>
            <em>Therav&#257;da</em>
            <span> lands. No scholar of Buddhism whether of </span>
            <em>Therav&#257;da</em>
            <span> or of </span>
            <em>Mah&#257;y&#257;na</em>
            <span> is unacquainted with it. Therefore there is no need of repeating what has already been said at one time or another. But an introduction to the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span>, can hardly avoid all mention of the </span>
            <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
            <span>, and I may be excused if I go over ground already covered by others. An endeavour, however, is made to present some of these facts, briefly and with a slightly new approach. It is for the reader to assess how far this has been achieved.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>In the introduction to his translation of the </span>
            <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
            <span>, The Path of Purification, the late Venerable &#209;&#257;&#7751;amoli Thera, after carefully sifting a large collection of material, points out that the influence of Sanskrit Buddhism, the centre of which was the Abhayagiri monastery in Anuradhapura, was so great in the first century A.C. that it became a threat to the Mah&#257;vih&#257;ra&#8217;s </span>
            <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="45" n="xliv"/>
            <span> position as the central authority of orthodox Pali Buddhism in Ceylon. Indeed that threat grew into open rivalry and even enmity between these two institutions, culminating in King Mah&#257;sena&#8217;s (277-304) giving protection to Sanghamitta, &#8220;a Cola monk, follower of Vetullav&#257;da&#8221;, and driving away the monks of the Mah&#257;vih&#257;ra from Anuradhapura for nine years. Then, Mah&#257;sena, repenting of his deeds, restored the Mah&#257;vih&#257;ra to its former position and burnt the Vetulyan books. But by then Sanghamitta had got the Lohap&#257;s&#257;da destroyed, and he and his friend, the minister So&#7751;a, were killed by a labourer on the orders of the queen when they attempted to destroy the Th&#363;p&#257;r&#257;ma. The efforts of the Mah&#257;vih&#257;ra monks since the beginning of the dispute with those of the Abhayagiri in the first century A.C. were solely directed to the establishment, says the Venerable &#209;&#257;&#7751;amoli Thera, of &#8220;Pali as the language for the study and discussion of Buddhist teachings, and the founding of a school of Pali literary composition&#8221; (Intro, p. xiv). He then goes on to say, &#8220;It is not known what was the first original Pali composition in this period; but the </span>
            <em>D&#299;pava&#7745;sa</em>
            <span> (dealing with historical evidence) belongs here (for it ends with Mah&#257;sena&#8217;s reign and is quoted in the </span>
            <em>Samantap&#257;s&#257;dik&#257;</em>
            <span>), and quite possibly the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span> (dealing with practice&#8212;see below) was another early attempt by the Great Monastery in this period (4th cent.) to reassert its supremacy through original Pali literary composition: there will have been others too. Of course, much of this is very conjectural&#8221; (Intro, p. xiv). It will be noted here that the Venerable &#209;&#257;&#7751;amoli Thera does not place the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span> during the reign of King Vasabha, but in the 4th century. Still it does not contradict the fact that the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera had access to the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span> of the Venerable Upatissa Thera when he wrote the </span>
            <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
            <span>.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>If the suggestion that the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span> &#8220;was another early attempt by the Great Monastery in this period to reassert its supremacy through Pali composition&#8221; is acceptable, it would then not be difficult to suppose that the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera, with what knowledge he had already acquired of the </span>
            <em>Dhamma</em>
            <span> in India&#8212;(for he had written the </span>
            <em>&#209;&#257;&#7751;odaya</em>
            <span>, the </span>
            <em>Atthas&#257;lin&#299;</em>
            <span> and had begun &#8220;to compose a commentary to the </span>

            <span>&#8212;), was able to write the </span>
            <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
            <span>, perhaps with the assistance of the Mah&#257;vih&#257;ra Theras. This work is more comprehensive than the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span> and in every sense more scholarly, with a wealth of material drawn from every imaginable source and interspersed with numerous Ceylon stories. Thus, not only did it provide instruction for those needing it in the practice of the </span>
            <em>Dhamma</em>
            <span>, but it was also capable of holding its own as a work of literary composition.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Two things seem to have played an important part in making available for later generations, even up to the present day, a work of such excellence as is the </span>
            <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
            <span>. They are: (1) The desperate need of the Mah&#257;vih&#257;ra for a work which would prove its claim to be the centre of Buddhist learning in Ceylon; (2) the equally urgent need of the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera to prove his ability as a worthy scholar in the eyes of the Theras of the Mah&#257;vih&#257;ra. Without this recognition he could not have obtained from them the commentaries and the expositions of the </span>
            <span>teachers (</span>
            <em>&#257;cariyav&#257;da</em>
            <span>) for translation into Pali as required by his teacher in India, the Venerable Revata Mah&#257; Thera, and for which express purpose he came to Ceylon (</span>

            <span>). That this dual need was supplied to the complete satisfaction of both parties is amply borne out by the recorded history of the centuries that followed.</span>

            <span> On certain points the </span>

            <span> and the </span>
            <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
            <span> hold contrary views. For instance, the latter says that by developing the </span>
            <em>Buddh&#257;nussati</em>
            <span> (the recollection of the Buddha) the factors of meditation, </span>
            <em>jh&#257;na</em>
            <span>, arise in a single moment; that as the qualities of the Buddha are unfathomable or else owing to reflection on his numerous qualities </span>
            <em>appan&#257;</em>
            <span> (fixed meditation) is not attained, and only </span>
            <em>upac&#257;ra</em>
            <span> (access-concentration) is reached. The </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span> on the other hand says that &#8220;from the recollection of the Buddha the four meditations, </span>
            <em>jh&#257;nas</em>
            <span> arise&#8221;. This statement seems to agree with the </span>
            <em>sutta</em>
            <span> and its commentary quoted in </span>
            <ptr type="vimm" target="p148n3">note 3[PAGE]</ptr>
            <span>.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>They agree that in practising </span>
            <em>&#256;n&#257;p&#257;nasati</em>
            <span> (mindfulness of respiration) the breath should not be followed inside or outside because it distracts the mind. This causes the body and the mind to waver and tremble. The simile of the man sawing wood illustrating where the breath should be noted (i.e., at nose-tip or on the lip) is common to both works. The </span>
            <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
            <span> quotes other similes in illustration. It also quotes (</span>
            <note type="TODO">p. 280</note>
            <span>) the </span>
            <em>Pa&#7789;isambhid&#257;magga</em>

            <ptr type="bib" target="Pts." loc=" I, p. 165">Pts. I, p. 165</ptr>
            <span>) which warns against the practice of trying to follow the inhaled breath to the heart (</span>
            <em>hadaya</em>
            <span>) and the navel (</span>
            <em>n&#257;bhi</em>
            <span>) and the outgoing breath back from the navel to the heart and nose-tip, for, both the mind and the body become &#8216;disquieted and perturbed and shaky&#8217; if this practice is resorted to. The </span>
            <em>Visuddhimagga</em>
            <span> (</span>
            <note type="TODO">p. 278</note>
            <span>) says that there are eight stages in the practice of </span>
            <em>&#256;n&#257;p&#257;nasati</em>
            <span>, the first four of which are (1) counting, (2) connection, (3) touching, and (4) fixing. Here the Venerable Buddhaghosa Thera does not quote authority for this statement as he usually does. The </span>

            <ptr type="vimm" target="p159-predecessors">VIII, sect. 4[PAGE]</ptr>
            <span>) supplies this omission by saying that &#8216;certain predecessors&#8217; taught these four ways. Here both base themselves on authority outside the texts and the commentaries.</span>

            <span>In discussing the earth </span>

            <span> (</span>
            <note type="TODO">p. 123</note>
            <span>) says, &#8216;The four blemishes of the earth </span>
            <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
            <span> are due to the intrusion of blue, yellow, red, or white&#8217;. But it does not 'give any reason. The </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span> (</span>
            <ptr type="vimm" target="p72-dwelling">VIII[PAGE]</ptr>

            <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
            <span>&#8217;. It is seen here that by practising one subject of meditation another cannot be developed &#8212; for instance, when one practises </span>
            <em>&#256;n&#257;p&#257;nasati</em>
            <span> one does not become proficient in, say, </span>
            <em>Buddh&#257;nussati</em>
            <span>, though this is sometimes imagined to be possible. If, for instance, one sees the form of the Buddha or a Buddha statue while developing any other meditation, then it is a clear case of failure in the practice of that particular meditation, though the seeing of these signs in itself is a good thing. The proper occasion for these signs to appear is when </span>
            <em>Buddh&#257;nussati</em>
            <span> is practised.</span>
          </p>

            <span>That the </span>
            <em>Vimuttimagga</em>
            <span> is an inspiring work is stated elsewhere. It is confirmed by the spontaneous testimony of those who have read the </span>

            <span> For what reason is the Path of Freedom taught? </span>
            <span rend="bold">A.</span>
            <span> There is a good man. He is like a blind man who wanders to a distant land without guidance, because, although he wishes to gain freedom, he does not listen to the teaching of freedom; because he does not acknowledge freedom and because he wrongly acknowledges freedom. Since he is hemmed in by much suffering he cannot gain freedom. Although he wishes to gain freedom, he has not the means. To gain freedom means are necessary. The Buddha has declared: &#8220;There are beings covered with but a little dust. They will fall away unless they hear the Truth&#8221;.</span>

            <span>Virtue cleanses away the impurities caused through transgression of precepts (&#8212; this is called the purification of virtue). Concentration cleanses away the encompassing impurities&#8212;this is called the purification of the mind. Wisdom removes the impurities of ignorance&#8212;this is called the purification of views. And again, virtue removes the impurities of demeritorious action. Concentration removes the encompassing impurities. Wisdom removes the impurities of the latencies.</span>

There is a man who is energetic; he attains to the stage of non-retrogression; on account of non-retrogression, he is joyful; on account of joy, he becomes buoyant; on account of buoyancy, his body is thrilled; on account of his body being thrilled, he is happy; on account of happiness, his mind is at ease &#8212; this is called &#8216;the initial good&#8217;. &#8216;Concentration is the medial good&#8217; thus: Through concentration a man understands things as they are &#8212; this is called the medial good. &#8216;Wisdom is the final good&#8217; thus: Under standing things as they are, a man is disgusted; through disgust he separates from passion; through separation from passion, he frees himself; having freed himself, he knows it (the nature of his freedom).</span>

Beheaded, (he) loses all good qualities. Thus in the teaching of the Buddha it is called, death. This is the meaning of &#8216;head&#8217; in virtue.

              <span>of the Order with pride in his heart, brushing past the venerable ones; he recklessly pushes them, or goes forward, or haughtily stands, or sits on a high seat before the venerable ones (sit), or keeps back the venerable ones, or sits pompously, or disdainful of the venerable ones disposes himself on a seat; or patting them (the venerable ones) on the shoulder, he speaks lightly to them. While the venerable ones go barefooted, he wears sandals. When aged and venerable ones walk on the path below, he walks on the high and broad road above. In various ways he slights and troubles (others). He withholds what is good from the younger bhikkhus. He gives what is mean to the venerable ones. Without permission, he bums fuel in the bath-room and opens and shuts the door. Or when he goes to the waterside, he enters it (the water) before them (the venerable ones) and twists and turns his body, or pats, in the fashion of rustics. When he goes to another&#8217;s house he enters abruptly, either by the back or by the front door; sits down and gets up in a disorderly manner; or he enters screened places and jokes with women and young girls and strokes their necks. Such misconduct is called &#8216;misbehaviour&#8217; of body.</span>

              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> &#8220;I take food greedily. I am strong. Therefore, I like violent sport, rough play, competing with others and running.&#8221; These constitute &#8216;violent sport&#8217;. &#8216;Intoxication&#8217; means self-arrogance and dissatisfaction. It is likened to the state of an angry man who beats another. &#8216;Not for the sake of personal charm and beautification&#8217;: (Not like) those who wish to be loved for the fullness of their body and limbs and good looks, and do not know contentment, being full of desires. &#8216;One takes (food and drink) in order to sustain the body and to preserve it&#8217;: As a hub needs oil, so one yearns for the peaceful preservation of the body. &#8216;One takes (food and drink) in order to stay </span>
              <span>hunger and thirst&#8217;: One, always, takes little food. As a man uses medicine for a disease of the skin, so one takes. &#8216;One takes (food and drink) in order to observe the holy life&#8217;: One wishes to reach the Noble Path through the advantages of abstemiousness.

              </note>
              <span> &#8220;Intended to remove old ills and not to allow new ills to arise&#8217;: One takes not too little and not too much. As a man taking a mixture, so one takes. &#8216;One takes (food and drink) finding satisfaction in little&#8217;: One keeps one&#8217;s body safe accepting little, always treating one&#8217;s body as a nurse (treats a patient). &#8216;Faultlessly&#8217; means one sets one&#8217;s body at ease with little. Using in this way, one makes the body faultless and escapes the reproof of the wise. Thus &#8216;one takes (food and drink) faultlessly and dwells in comfort&#8217;.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>If one&#8217;s food is suitable, one never feels tired and one does not sleep in the first, middle and last watches of the night. In this way one fulfils tranquillity. Thus &#8216;through eight ways one wisely reflects in accepting alms&#8217;. Thus one should accept.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>And again, these eight ways are shortened to four considerations: the consideration of what ought to be cut down, the consideration of reality, the consideration of being satisfied with little, the consideration of accepting little.</span>

            </p>
            <p>
              <span>These four considerations are further shortened to three thus: consideration of cutting down, consideration of mean (lit. taking the middle between two ends), consideration of completion.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>A man cuts down the attachment to sense-pleasures through the &#8216;consideration of cutting down&#8217; i.e., removes hunger and thirst, destroys the old ills and does not cause new ills to arise. And again, by this &#8216;consideration&#8217; a man destroys karmic weariness of the body. The others should be practised in the &#8216;consideration of mean&#8217; and the &#8216;consideration of completion&#8217;.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>And when one reflects on robes he understands that robes are for protection against wind, cold, heat, mosquitoes, gadflies and ants and for covering one&#8217;s unsightly shame-producing parts. Thus one practises &#8216;consideration of completion&#8217;.</span>

              <span>. Why? Because, through separation from worldly affairs owing to non-attachment, one becomes quiet of behaviour and acquires restraint of bodily and verbal actions. These two kinds of virtue belong to the &#8216;virtue of the restraint of faculties&#8217;. What is the reason? If a man guards his mind in goodness, he can well protect his bodily and verbal actions. &#8216;(Virtue) connected with the requisites&#8217; is &#8216;restraint of faculties&#8217;. What is the reason? One knows the aggregations and their dependence and is disgusted with them, and dwells in Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration. It is as taught by the Blessed One thus: &#8220;A bhikkhu understands material food and the fivefold lust&#8221;.</span>

          <span> Now, if a yogin who dwells in pure virtue aspires to accomplish excellent good merits and wishes to acquire the benefits of the austerities, he should consider thus: &#8220;Why should one acquire the benefits of the austerities&#8221;?</span>

        <p>
          <span rend="bold">A.</span>
          <span> Because of the varying disposition of the yogin. For paucity of wishes, for contentment with little, for freedom from doubt, for the destruction of craving, for the increase of energy, for the sake of using little and not accepting the offerings made to others, for solitude, for the cutting down of clinging and for the protection of moral virtue. These (the merits of the austerities) are the equipment of concentration. These are (practices of) the ancient lineage of the Ariyas.</span>

            <span> these eight are taught: &#8220;&#8216;Measured food&#8217; and &#8216;one-eating&#8217; are involved in &#8216;no food after time&#8217;. &#8216;Dwelling under a tree&#8217;, &#8216;dwelling in a dewy place&#8217;, &#8216;dwelling among the graves&#8217; are involved in &#8216;dwelling in a peaceful place&#8217;, because, if one gathers funds for building a house, or if one likes to (do remunerative) work, keeps animals or is attached to &#8216;dwelling in a peaceful place&#8217;, one&#8217;s mind is not at ease. Thus thinking one dwells in peace &#8216;under a tree&#8217;, &#8216;among the graves&#8217; or &#8216;in a dewy place&#8217; &#8221;. Thus the eight are fulfilled.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>By these eight austerities three teachings are fulfilled: the first: &#8216;dwelling in a peaceful place&#8217;, the second: &#8216;dirt-rags&#8217;, the third: &#8216;begged food&#8217;. If these three are pure, the austerities are fulfilled. Therefore the Buddha taught the Venerable Elder Nanda thus: &#8220;Always you should observe &#8216;dwelling in a peaceful place&#8217;, &#8216;dirt-rags&#8217; and &#8216;begged food&#8217;. You should not nurse your body and life. You should not see the objects of lust.&#8221;</span>

            <span rend="bold">A.</span>
            <span> There are thirteen austerities taught by the Buddha. These are precepts of the Buddha. These are called austerity-factors. Here the skilful, unskilful and the non-characterizable</span>

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>How many kinds of teachings are there? There are two teachings of austerities: non-greed and non-delusion. The Buddha has said, &#8220;If a bhikkhu who observes (the austerity of) &#8216;dirt-rags&#8217; is endowed with paucity of wishes, is contented with little, enjoys tranquillity, is doubt-free and relies on freedom, then he is called one who observes (the austerity of) &#8216;dirt-rags&#8217; &#8221;.</span>

            <span> The other austerities are all greedless and delusion-free. By means of this greedlessness, a bhikkhu removes ignorance in thirteen places. And again by this greed lessness which the Buddha made possible (a bhikkhu) arouses in his mind aversion, and being free from doubt, reasonably removes the stain of lust and crookedness. By this freedom from delusion, he removes weariness of the flesh and crookedness. These are the two teachings of austerities. These are greedlessness and freedom from delusion. </span>

            <span>Which of the three persons observe the austerities&#8217;? The man of greed and the man of delusion observe the austerities. The man of hate cannot' observe the austerities. The man of greed and the man of delusion can observe the austerities. The man of greed accomplishes heedfulness through attachment. If he becomes heedless, he overcomes greed. Delusion is non-doubting. By means of the austerities a bhikkhu can fulfil heedfulness. If he is heedful, he can overcome delusion well. That is why the man of greed and the man of delusion observe the austerities.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Heedless men suffer and do evil. A heedless man should not observe (because if he does, he will increase his sufferings), just as a person afflicted with a disease of phlegm worsens on taking hot drinks.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>And again there is a tradition. A heedless man should dwell &#8216;in a peaceful place&#8217; or &#8216;under a tree&#8217;. Why should he dwell &#8216;in a peaceful place&#8217;? Because there are no worldly troubles there.</span>

            <span>How many seasons are there for the observance of austerities? Eight months are the period for three austerities, namely, &#8216;dwelling under a tree&#8217;, &#8216;dwelling in a dewy place&#8217; and &#8216;dwelling among the graves&#8217;. The Buddha has permitted dwelling in roofed places in the rainy season.</span>

One&#8217;s mind arouses joy, partakes of the joy of the supramundane and dwells pleasantly in the happiness of truth in the present life. Therefore, has the Blessed One said: &#8220;He produces joy from quietude, acquires coolness and becomes perfect gradually.&#8221;</span>

            <p>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> Because the result depends on two sorts of men. In the second meditation there are two divisions: without initial and sustained application of thought, and without initial and only with sustained application of thought,</span>

            <p>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> He considers the coarseness of initial and sustained application of thought, knows the disadvantages of initial and sustained application of thought, and induces the second meditation which is free from initial and sustained application of thought. This is the way of progress in the four meditations.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>And again, there is another man. He is able to induce freely the second meditation out of the first meditation. He considers the coarseness of initial application of thought and knows the disadvantages of initial application of thought. He discerns the state of being free from initial application of thought. Possessing restricted sustained application of thought, he induces the second meditation. This is the way of progress in the five meditations. Therefore, the five meditations are taught.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>And again, there are five kinds in concentration, namely, complete fixed meditation in the five factors: joyfulness, blissfulness, mindfulness, luminousness and the perception of steadily moving thought. Here &#8216;joyfulness&#8217; is in the first and the second meditations. &#8216;Blissfulness&#8217; is in the third meditation. &#8216;Mindfulness&#8217; is in the knowledge of others&#8217; thoughts. &#8216;Luminousness&#8217; is in the knowledge of the divine eye. The knowledge of steadily moving thought is born of reflection</span>

            <p>
              <span>And again there are five kinds in concentration, namely, Right Concentration connected with the fivefold knowledge. These are consequences of present bliss and the bliss to be. These arise depending on the knowledge of the body.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>(1)</span>
              <span> </span>
              <span>This concentration is practised by the Noble Ones and is passion-free.</span>

              <span> </span>
              <span>This is the excellent bliss of solitude and the attainment of tranquillity. Although this accomplishes the unique, yet it does not overcome birth and death. </span>

              <span>(4)</span>
              <span> </span>
              <span>This concentration is most pleasant and peaceful. This becomes one endowed with tranquillity. This does not overcome the (belief in) self (which is the cause) of birth and death.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>(5)</span>
              <span> </span>
              <span>This concentration moves in mindfulness and is a cause of mindfulness. These arise owing to knowledge of the body.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>And now, (the acceptance of) objects of meditation, what is connected with the requisites, and the inferior, the middling and the superior have been distinguished. Thus there are many divisions of concentration.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>(Further), it should be known that all concentration may be classified under the four meditations.</span>

          <span> If a man wishes to bring out concentration, he, at first, should approach a pre-eminent friend. Why?

At one time, when the Enlightened One was wandering in the land of Magadha, he arrived at Jantug&#257;ma, and his sole attendant was the Venerable Elder Meghiya.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>And in the morning, the Venerable Elder Meghiya taking bowl and robe went to the village of Jantug&#257;ma for alms. And after completing his alms-round, he wended his way to the bank of the river Kimil&#257;la. The land there was level meadow, and it was known as the Grove of Sweet Mango. Beside it ran the excellent waters of Kimil&#257;la, sparklingly clear. Seeing the pleasant place, the Venerable Elder Meghiya was delighted and thought: &#8216;The land here is level meadow and is known as the Grove of Sweet Mango. Beside it runs the excellent waters of Kimil&#257;la, sparklingly clear. Meet is this spot for a clansman for the exercise of energy&#8217;.</span>
            </p>

              <span>And having finished his meal, put aside his bowl and robe, washed his hands and feet, he, with one shoulder bared, went to the presence of the Enlightened One, bowed at the Enlightened One&#8217;s feet, and sat on one side. And being seated he spoke thus: &#8220;Venerable Sir, in the morning, having taken bowl and robe, I went to the village of Jantug&#257;ma for alms&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.: and I thought: &#8216;The land here is level meadow and is known as the Grove of Sweet Mango. Beside it runs the excellent waters of Kimil&#257;la, sparklingly clear. Meet is this spot for a clansman for the exercise of energy&#8217;. How, Venerable Sir, if I should go to that calm place in the Grove of Sweet Mango and exercise energy?&#8221;</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Then the Blessed One said: &#8216;Meghiya, there is no one except you here. Stay</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>awhile until another bhikkhu comes to wait on me. Then you may go to that calm place in the Grove of Sweet Mango to exercise energy&#8217;</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>A second and a third time the Venerable Elder Meghiya requested permission and for a second and third time did the Blessed One refuse it.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Then the Venerable Elder Meghiya said: &#8216;Venerable Sir, the Blessed One has nothing more to do. The Blessed One need not exert energy any longer. But I, Venerable Sir, have much to do yet. Therefore, Venerable Sir, I wish to enter that calm place in the Grove of Sweet Mango and exercise energy&#8217;.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Then the Blessed One said: &#8216;Meghiya, if you wish to exert yourself, I do not stop you. Go Meghiya and do as you please&#8217;.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>The Venerable Elder Meghiya hearing the words of the Enlightened One and accepting them, bowed at the Enlightened One&#8217;s feet, walked round Him three times and departed. Arriving at the Grove of Sweet Mango, he went to the foot of a tree, prepared a seat and sat down.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>And when he was thus seated in the forest, three demeritorious states of mind arose in him, namely, discursive thoughts connected with lust, discursive thoughts connected with hate and discursive thoughts connected with harming. Then the Venerable Elder Meghiya thought of the Blessed One, arose from his seat and forthwith returned to the presence of the Blessed One (and told the Blessed One everything) and the Blessed One said: &#8216;Your mind is not yet ripe for deliverance. If you wish to cause it to ripen, you should train yourself in the five trainings. What are the five? Meghiya, a bhikkhu is a good friend and he should be in the company of a good friend, he should closely associate with a good friend.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>&#8216;Meghiya, if your mind is not ripe for deliverance, and if you wish to cause it to ripen, this is the first training&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8217;</span>

          <span> It is </span>
          <span>comparable to a man who sets out alone on a distant journey. None guides him. When a man sets out alone, he is like an elephant that is not guided by the goad. If, when a yogin practises, he listens to the discourses and instructions of a good friend, he is able to remove his many difficulties and get into the right method and practice. If he strenuously endeavours and strictly trains himself, then he is able to acquire excellent concentration.</span>

            <span>&#8216;Esteemableness&#8217; means that one is tranquillized through the action of virtue, fulfils the protection of mindfulness, is not over-desirous and does not speak much. This is called &#8216;esteemableness&#8217;.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>&#8216;Venerableness&#8217; means that one is endowed with the merit of much learning and appreciates well the value of meditation. This is &#8216;venerableness&#8217;.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>&#8216;The ability to counsel well&#8217; means that one considers thus: &#8220;Let my speech be lovable, esteemable, venerable and fruitful&#8221;, and benefits others and esteems the truth. Therefore, one restrains oneself from things that ought not to be done. Thus one observes to the end and does not forsake. This is called &#8216;the ability to counsel well&#8217;.</span>

Which is the suitable place of meditation for a bhikkhu? What is the name of the teacher who dwells there? For what practices and for what merits is he honoured by all&#8221;?

            <span>If that bhikkhu is a senior or a venerable one, one should not hand one&#8217;s bowl and robe. But if he is junior, one should. If there is none, one places one&#8217;s bowl and robe on the ground. When one sees the elder, one bows at his feet and sits at one side.</span>

            <span>According to the rules for visiting bhikkhus, one should go round, within the precincts of the monastery, before sundown.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>If one sees a teacher of discipline, one should talk with him and ask him concerning any faults with regard to which one is in doubt, and which one has not yet committed. Or, if one sees a teacher of </span>
            <em>Abhidhamma</em>
            <span>, one should inquire concerning the method of acquiring wisdom and about the aggregates, sense-spheres, elements and </span>
            <em>kamma</em>
            <span>. If one sees an observer of austerities, one should inquire concerning the benefits of the austerities connected with wisdom. If one dwells there, one should go to many and daily make inquiries. If one wishes to leave, one folds one&#8217;s bedding and bows at the seniors&#8217; feet and informs them and leaves. These are the rules for visiting bhikkhus.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>How does a yogin dwell in a monastery? When the teacher of meditation comes, one should take his bowl and robe, even if he be a junior. According to the rule of the teacher of meditation, one should practise that which ought to be practised or not practise the ought-not-to-be-practised, and one should not abandon the practising (of that which ought to be practised and of that which ought not to be practised). This is the practice that should be observed at first. Thus should one practise.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>If the yogin wishes to let others learn the Law at first, he watches the dwelling-place and keeps the bowls and robes. After sometime has passed, he, at the proper- time, approaches the teacher of meditation, salutes him respectfully, and remaining silent a while, sits.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Should the teacher of meditation question the yogin, he expresses his desire. If the teacher of meditation does not question, the yogin should not speak. Thereupon he should ask for tooth-sticks and water for washing, and should use them in the proper way.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>When the time for the alms-round comes, he should ask permission of the teacher and follow the usual way.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>When the meal-time arrives, one should wash the teacher&#8217;s feet, arrange his seat, give him the bowl and inquire of the teacher what he wants from one&#8217;s own bowl. Having partaken of the remainder, one gives what is left over to the juniors. Thus one observes and abstains from' quarrelling.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>After finishing one&#8217;s meal, one washes the teacher&#8217;s bowl and puts it in the proper place.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Seeing a suitable time, one approaches the teacher, respectfully salutes him, and remaining silent a while, sits. Should the teacher question, one should express one&#8217;s desires. Should the teacher not question, one worships and says: &#8220;I will now say what I wanted to say from the first. If I am permitted, I wish to ask what I want&#8221;. Should the teacher permit, one expresses everything. Should the teacher not question, one should worship him. </span>

            <span rend="bold">A.</span>
            <span> In a passionate person, when he does good, faith is strong, because this quality approaches passion.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>And again, passion and faith are alike owing to three traits: clinging, searching for the good, non-repulsion.</span>

          <p>
            <span>Here &#8216;passion&#8217; means the being intent on passion. &#8216;Faith&#8217; means the being intent on good. &#8216;Passion&#8217; means the search for what is passionally good. &#8216;Faith&#8217; means the search for what is morally good. The nature of &#8216;passion&#8217; is not to forsake what is bad. The nature of &#8216;faith&#8217; is not to forsake what is good. Therefore, a walker in &#8216;passion&#8217; becomes one with a walker in &#8216;faith&#8217;. </span>

          <p>
            <span rend="bold">A.</span>
            <span> In a hating person, when he does good, intelligence is strong, because this quality approaches hate.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>And again, hate and intelligence are alike owing to three traits: nonclinging, searching for faults, repulsion.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>As a hating person does not cleave (to what is good), so an intelligent person does not cleave (to what is bad). As a hating person is given to fault-finding, so an intelligent person is given to the search for the faults of wrongful conduct. As a hating person repulses others, so an intelligent person repulses the conformations. Therefore, the walker in hate becomes one with the walker in intelligence. They are alike.</span>

            <span> Why does a walker in infatuation become one with a walker in excogitation?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span rend="bold">A.</span>
            <span> In an infatuated person who endeavours to arouse virtuous states, incertitude increases, because this quality approaches infatuation and because of separation from faith and wisdom.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>And again, infatuation and excogitation are alike owing to two traits: instability and movement. As infatuation is not peaceful because it is disturbed, so excogitation is not peaceful because of various trends of discursive thought. As infatuation moves, not knowing where to go, so excogitation moves because of levity. Therefore, a walker in infatuation becomes one with a walker in excogitation. They are equal.</span>

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>One who walks in passion looks at an object as if he had not seen it before. He does not see its faults, and does not consider them. He does not make light of even a little merit (of the object). He cannot free himself of the desire for it. Even after he reflects he cannot mend his ways. Towards the other objects of sense also he behaves in the same way. Thus it may be known that one is a walker in passion.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>One who walks in hate looks at an object thus: he does not look long at an object, as though he were tired. When he is affected by the humours, </span>
            <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="122" n="59"/>
            <span> he quarrels with others often. Even with very good things he is not pleased. Thus he rejects all things. His way of life is determined by the humours. Towards other objects, of sense also he behaves in the same way. Thus it may be known that one is a walker in hate.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>One who walks in infatuation looks at an object thus: he believes others as regards merits and demerits (of anything). He considers worthless what others consider worthless. He praises what others praise, because he does not know. Towards the other objects of sense also he behaves in the same way. Thus it may be known that one is a walker in infatuation. Thus it may be known &#8216;through (the manner of seeing) objects&#8217;.</span>

            <span>A walker in infatuation does not prepare his bed in an orderly manner. In sleep, his limbs are out, and only his body is covered. On being awakened at night, he murmurs and answers long after. Thus it may be known &#8216;through (the manner of) sleeping&#8217;.</span>

          <p>
            <span>A hating man is much affected by the humours, and does not allow himself to be stained by the defilements.</span>

          <p>
            <span>And again, there is another teaching: &#8220;When I investigate the subjects of meditation, I see their distinctive qualities. The six persons may, through discernment, be reduced to three&#8221;.</span>

            <span rend="bold">Q.</span>

            <span rend="bold">A.</span>
            <span> There are two kinds of men who walk in passion, namely, (the man) of dull faculties and (the man) of keen faculties. A walker in passion who has dull faculties should practise the investigation of impurity in order to overcome lust. Thus he should practise and overcome lust.</span>
            <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="133" n="70"/>
            <span> </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>The walker in passion who has keen faculties should, at first, increase faith. He should practise the recollections. Thus he should practise and overcome lust.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>There are two kinds of men who walk in hate, namely, (the man) of dull faculties and (the man) of keen faculties. A walker in hate who has dull faculties should practise the four immeasurables. By this he will be able to overcome hatred.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>The walker in hate who has keen faculties, being one endowed with wisdom, should practise the (meditation of the) special sphere. Thus should one practise and dispel hatred.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>There are two kinds of men who walk in infatuation, namely, (the man) of no faculties and (the man) of dull faculties. The walker in infatuation who has no faculties should not work at any subject of meditation. The walker in infatuation who has dull faculties should practise mindfulness of respiration in order to dispel discursive thinking.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Thus (the six persons) can be reduced to three. Therefore, there should be no difficulty. According to this teaching, the </span>
            <em>kasi&#7751;as</em>
            <span> and mindfulness of respiration are developed (further) through space. All the activities can be fulfilled without difficulty. If a man is endowed with merit, he will have no difficulty in fulfilling all the excellent subjects of meditation.</span>

Taking a moderate quantity in a vessel, let him carefully mix it with water and remove grass, roots and dirt from it. With the edge of a cloth let him remove any dirt that may be on the swept place. Let him screen the sitting place and exclude the light, and make a couch of meditation. Let him make a circle according to rule, neither too near nor too far. Let the circle be flat and full and without markings. After that let watery clay unmixed with any other colour or unmixed with special colour be applied.

In the Pali there are only seven illustrations. The following is taken from the Ch&#363; Agon (</span>

                  <span>) No. 203: &#8220;Householder, it is as if, not far from a village, there were a huge venomous snake, very vicious, poisonous, black and terrible of aspect, and a man not foolish, not deluded, not insane, in full possession of his senses, desirous of weal and shunning woe, disliking sorrow very much, wishing to live, not wishing to die and disliking death very much, were to come. What do you think, householder, would that man stretch out his hand or any other member of his body to the snake, saying, &#8216;Bite me, bite me&#8217;?&#8221; Then the householder answered: &#8220;No, venerable Gotama, because on seeing the venomous snake he would think: &#8216;If I were to stretch forth my hand or other member of my body and let the snake bite it, I should die or suffer severely&#8217;. And so, on seeing that venomous snake, he wishes to flee from it&#8221;. Householder, the learned, noble disciple also thinks in the same way: &#8216;Sense-desires are like a venomous snake. It was taught by the Blessed One that sense-desires are like a venomous snake. They yield little pleasure, produce much suffering and are pain-laden&#8217;. And he abandons sense-desires, becomes freed from evil states of mind and causes to perish all worldly enjoyment and clings to nothing&#8221;.</span>

              <span> closing the eyes fast, he will not see the sign because of darkness, and he will arouse negligence. Therefore, he should refrain from opening his eyes too wide and closing them fast. He should dwell with earnestness on the </span>

              <span>Elation: If the yogin&#8217;s mind becomes lax through losing itself in frivolous thoughts, he becomes discontented with the subject of meditation. If he, at first, does not delight in frivolous thoughts, his mind becomes elated through willing. Or again, it becomes elated, if he does many deeds through the will for happiness and bliss.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Depression: The yogin fails owing to agitation and thereby partakes of uneasiness, and dislikes the subject of meditation. If he dislikes the subject of meditation from the start he resents activity and, accordingly through resentment, his mind becomes depressed. And again, his mind becomes weary of initial and sustained application of thought, falls from distinction and, owing to craving, becomes depressed.</span>

            <p>
              <span>When this yogin&#8217;s mind falls into a state of agitation, quickly, he overcomes and abandons agitation, with the faculty of mindfulness and the faculty of concentration. When his mind falls into a state of negligence, he should overcome and abandon that state of mind-negligence with the faculty of mindfulness and the faculty of energy. When the man of elated mind falls into a lustful state, he should abandon lust forthwith. When the man of depressed mind falls into an angry state, he should abandon anger forthwith. In these four places a man accomplishes and makes his mind move in one direction. If his mind moves in one direction, the sign can be made to arise&#8217;.</span>

              <span>(3) Skilfulness in taking the sign: The mind-faculty takes (the sign) well, i.e., neither too hastily nor too slowly. It is like a skilful carpenter, who, having determined well, pulls the inked-string, lets it go at the right moment and thereby marks an even, uncurved line.</span>

              <span> </span>
              <span>By restraining and regulating the mind: There are two ways. By these two, the mind is regulated: the first, through intense effort; the second, through profound investigation of the spheres or the mind becomes discursive, wandering to distant and unsuitable spheres and is thus disturbed.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Through two ways one restrains the mind: One arouses energy. One takes (food) temperately every day. If the mind wanders to unsuitable spheres and objects, one restrains the mind having considered the evil results (of such </span>
              <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="145" n="82"/>
              <span> actions). Thus one overcomes in two ways: through investigation of various sufferings and through the search for the reward of evil deeds.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>(5) (6) and (7). By repressing negligence: Through two ways negligence of mind is fulfilled: through lack of distinction in concentration and through mental inactivity. When there is much negligence, the mind becomes sluggish and torpid. This means that, if the yogin does not gain distinction in concentration, his mind is steeped in negligence because of mental inactivity. Through two ways one should repress. Namely, through the consideration of merit and through the arousing of energy. He should repress negligence of torpor and idleness of mind in four ways: &#8212; If he is a voracious person he considers (the faults of) negligence and practises the four restraints. Fixing his mind on the sign of brightness, he dwells in a dewy place, makes his mind rejoice and gets rid of attachment. Through three ways mental inactivity takes place: through insufficiency of skill, dullness of wit, non-obtainment of the ease of solitude. If a yogin&#8217;s mind is inactive he makes it active in these two ways: through fear and through gladness.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>If he considers birth, decay, death and the four states of woe, owing to fear, anxiety and mental agony arise in his mind.</span>

            <p>
              <span>(8). By the mind becoming steady and fulfilling equanimity: Through two actions (the mind) fulfils access-meditation: by destroying the hindrances the mind fulfils fixity. Or, arousing the meditation (</span>

              <span>) factors on already acquired earth (</span>

              <span>According to another tradition, there are three kinds of demerit: the first is natural; the second is associated; the third is causally produced. The three roots of demerit aie named natural. Sensations, perceptions, formations and consciousness which are connected with these are named associated. The actions of body, speech and mind which are produced are called causally produced. The separation from these three demeritorious states is called renunciation, freedom, the unassociated. This is called separation from demeritorious states. And again, separation from lust means the separation from the hindrance of lust. Separation from demeritorious states is separation from the other hindrances.</span>

It is comparable to the store of a poor man. All-pervading joy permeating the body, continues. It is like a thundercloud that is full of rain.

              <span>Sense-desire: (This refers to) a mind defiled by the dust of passion. Ill will: This is the practice of the ten defilements. Rigidity: This is negligence of the mind. Torpor: This is the desire for sleep owing to heaviness of the body. There are three kinds of torpor: the first, proceeds from food; the second, from time; the third, from the mind. If it proceeds from the mind, one removes it with meditation. If it proceeds from food and time as in the case of the Arahant, because it does not proceed from the mind, it is not a hindrance. If it proceeds from food and time, one cuts it with energy as the Venerable Elder Anuruddha taught: &#8220;Since first I destroyed the cankers for fifty-five years, have I not slept the sleep that proceeds from the mind. And during this period for twenty-five years, have I removed the sleep that proceeds from food and time&#8221;.</span>

              <span> The body is produced only by mental defilement. It is like a man drinking wine and taking food. Thus should it be known.</span>

              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> These two states have one object and one function. What are called torpor and rigidity become one. Agitation is non-tranquillity of mind; anxiety is unsteadiness of mind; the characteristics of these are equal. Therefore they become one hindrance. Uncertainty is the clinging of the mind to diverse objects. There are four kinds of uncertainty: the first is a hindrance to serenity,</span>

              <span>Here, is serenity won through the ending of these uncertainties, or is it possible or not to win tranquillity while having these uncertainties or the uncertainty concerning the self? If one has that uncertainty, it is called a hindrance to serenity; uncertainty concerning the Four Noble Truths and the three worlds is called a hindrance to insight; uncertainty concerning the Buddha, the Law and the Community of Bhikkhus is called a hindrance to both. Uncertainty concerning things like country, town, road, name of man or woman is called hindrance to things non-doctrinal. Uncertainty concerning the Discourses is a hindrance to solitude.

            <p>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> Initial application of thought follows the object of mind and acquires fixed meditation. Sustained application of thought goes together with the observing mind. When initial and sustained application of thought are unmixed, they cause the arising of skilfulness. If one is skilful, one produces joy and bliss. If one is skilful, one can produce the heart of joy, and after increasing that, produce the heart of bliss. With these four qualities the mind becomes peaceful. If the mind becomes peaceful, it acquires concentration. These are called the characteristics of combination. Thus, these five, through combination, accomplish (meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>

            </p>
            <p>
              <span>And again, the hindrances are overcome by the perfection of the five. The overcoming of the first hindrance is the first meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>. Thus the overcoming of the five hindrances results in five meditations, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;nas</em>
              <span>. In the first meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, initial application of thought is the special factor; through initial application of thought lust is abandoned. If initial application of thought enters into right concentration, the other factors are also awakened. Among the five factors, sustained application of thought is the beginning of the second meditation; joy, of the third meditation; bliss, of the fourth; and unification of mind, of the fifth. These are the special factors of the meditations, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;nas</em>

            </p>
            <p>
              <span>And again, with the overcoming of the five hindrances, the five are fulfilled, as it is taught in the </span>

              <span> As bath-powder, owing to coarseness, does not adhere and is scattered by the wind, so the mind and mental properties when they are separated from joy and bliss, become coarse. And if they are separated from concentration they do not adhere and are scattered by the winds of the five hindrances. Therefore it is said that the bath-powder is like the mind and mental properties. What is comparable to water? Namely, joy and bliss and concentration. As water moistens, renders malleable, makes it round, so joy and bliss moisten and render malleable the mind and mental properties, and produce concentration. Therefore water is like joy and bliss. Like the stirring of the bath-powder with water are initial and sustained application of thought. Thus they should be understood.</span>

              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> Namely, initial and sustained application of thought. As a skilful bath-attendant puts the bath-powder into the copper vessel, mixes it with water, makes it round with his hand, and having made it round, he rounds it further with more wet powder and puts it into the vessel without scattering, so does the yogin place his mind and mental properties in the object and produce tranquillity well. In the first meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, joy and bliss should be regarded as water, initial and sustained application of thought as the hand that stirs and makes it (the powder) round. Thus one is able to produce tranquillity well. The mind and mental properties become rounded with joy and bliss and are not scattered because of the mind being kept on the object of meditation. Thus the rounded bath-powder is like initial and sustained application of thought. Just as the bath-powder is moistened thoroughly and just as it, through adhering, does not scatter, so the yogin in the first meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, is filled with joy from head to foot and from foot to skull, skin and hair, and dwells without falling. Thus one dwells in the realm of Brahma.</span>

            <p>
              <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
              <span> Joy and bliss are called formless states. How then can they fill the body?</span>

              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> Name depends on form. Form depends on name. Therefore, if name is full of joy, form also is full of joy. If name is full of bliss, form also is full of bliss. And again, form that is bliss-produced, causes calm of body, and owing to the bliss of form the entire body is tranquillized. Thus there is no contradiction.</span>

              <span>, a man has not sufficient energy to destroy the evil discursive thinking which he caused to arise in the past. Thus, owing to the denseness of the encompassing impurities, he deteriorates. (2) Or, a man who is desirous of meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, is given to talk, addicted to sleep, and does not endeavour. Hence he deteriorates.</span>

              <span> There is an opinion that if a man becomes impure of mind, he will fall back. And again, there is an opinion: Through slow pollution of the mind, one falls back. And again, there is another opinion: If a man loses serenity, he falls back. And there is yet another opinion: If a man does not practise for a long time on the sign he caused to arise in the past, he becomes incapable of making it to arise as he likes and does not attain to concentration. So, he falls back. If a man of dull faculties dwells heedfully, he acquires the recollectedness of that state and partakes of stability in meditation, </span>

She thinks: &#8220;How, if I were to enter the place I never entered before, eat the grass I never ate before and drink the water I never drank before&#8221;? Without planting her fore leg firmly, she raises her hind leg, becomes restless and is not able to go forward. And not being able to enter the place she never entered before, eat the grass she never ate before, drink the water she never drank before, she thinks thus: &#8220;I cannot go forward. I must return to the old pasturage&#8221;.</span>

The six internal sense spheres. &#8220;Internal concentration&#8221;: The contemplation on one&#8217;s own bodily state is called &#8220;internal concentration&#8221;. The thought which is inward (subjective), does not go outwards, and the nature of which is to understand is called &#8220;internal object&#8221;. In this treatise &#8220;internal in the sense of personal&#8221; means &#8220;to be in a state of blissfulness&#8221;.</span>

              <span> (It is said that the yogin) &#8216;&#8216;develops internal tranquillity and the state of mind-predominance&#8221;. If that be so, why are these not included in the first meditation, </span>

              <em>jh&#257;na</em>

            <p>
              <span>&#8220;Internal tranquillity and the state of mind-predominance&#8221;: just as, owing to waves, water becoming turbid, does not clearly reflect any image, cast on it, just so in the first meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, because of turbidity due to the movement of the waves of initial and sustained application of thought, internal tranquillity and the state of mind-predominance are not clear. Therefore, they are not included in the first meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>.</span>

            <p>
              <span>&#8216;Without initial and sustained application of thought&#8221;: After the stilling of initial application of thought, there is no initial application of thought. After the stilling of sustained application of thought, there is no sustained application of thought.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
              <span> The stilling of initial and sustained application of thought is the state that is without initial and sustained application of thought. Are there two kinds of ending of initial and sustained application of thought? Why are two kinds taught?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> The stilling of initial and sustained application of thought develops internal tranquillity. The state of mind-predominance becomes the cause of the state that is without initial and sustained application of thought, owing to the appearance of the excellent characteristic of joy and bliss which is born of solitude.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>And again, the stilling of initial and sustained application of thought is thus: Seeing through initial and sustained application of thought, the tribulation of initial and sustained application of thought, he abandons them. The </span>
              <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="166" n="103"/>
              <span> state that is without initial and sustained application of thought is the stilling of initial and sustained application of thought of the form element.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>And again, in what is without initial and sustained application of thought there are two divisions: the first is &#8220;without initial and sustained application of thought&#8221; that is not due to the stilling of initial and sustained application of thought; (the second) is &#8220;without initial and sustained application of thought&#8221; that is due to the stilling of initial and sustained application of thought. Thus, without the stilling of initial and sustained application of thought, the five branches of higher knowledge and the third meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, are without initial and sustained application of thought. The second meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, is without initial and sustained application of thought through skilful seclusion and the stilling of initial and sustained application of thought. These are the two divisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>&#8220;Born of concentration&#8221;: This refers to concentration. The first meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, comes from that consciousness and the second meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, comes from the first meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>. And again, &#8220;concentration&#8221; means that the second meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, comes together with unification of mind.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>&#8220;The second meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>

            </p>
            <p>
              <span>&#8220;Attains to the second meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>&#8221;, means that he enters the second meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>.</span>

              <em>jh&#257;na</em>

              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>&#8221;.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>&#8220;Attains to and dwells in the second meditation, </span>

              <span> which is free from two factors, endowed with two factors, three kinds of goodness and ten characteristics and is associated with twenty-three merits. </span>

              <span>A yogin entering the second meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, should consider his body in the light of this simile of the pool with water welling up from within. The absence of any stream flowing from any of the four directions is to be understood as the stilling of initial and sustained application of thought. As the water welling up from within fills the pool without causing waves to arise in it, </span>
              <pb ed="PTS" n="419a"/>
              <span> so joy and bliss springing from concentration fills the mental and bodily factors and there is no disturbance of mind. As water that is cold cools the body, so joy and bliss born of concentration causes all the mental and bodily factors to be at ease.</span>

            <p>

            <p>
              <span>What are the tribulations of the second meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>? This concentration has initial and sustained application of thought as its near enemy. This meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, being accompanied by joy, is coarse. The mind exults in the possession of joy and is not able to arouse other (higher) meditation (</span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>) factors. To be attached to joy is a fault. If he understands these faults, he becomes fault-free. One is not able to acquire supernormal power; or one gains the second meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, and is not able to partake of distinction. Thus should one understand the tribulations of the </span>

              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>. The merits of the third meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na,</em>
              <span> lie in the overcoming of these (tribulations). If one considers the tribulations of the second meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, and the merits of the third, he can remove joy through meditation, </span>

              <span>&#8220;Through absence of desire for joy&#8221;: Joy has already been explained. &#8220;Absence of desire&#8221;: Removing joy one dwells in equanimity. What is &#8220;equanimity&#8221;? Equipoise, protection, non-retreating, non-advancing, serenity and evenness of mind are called &#8220;equanimity&#8221;. There are eight kinds of equanimity: equanimity of feeling, of effort, of insight, of the enlightenment factors, of the immeasurable states, of the six members (senses), of the meditation (</span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>

              <span> The equanimity of feeling is the equanimity of the five faculties. Reflection on the sign of equanimity from time to time&#8212; this is the equanimity of effort. If, saying, &#8220;I will remove the cause of suffering&#8221;, one attains to equanimity, it is called the equanimity of insight. The practising of the enlightenment factors is the equanimity of the enlightenment factors. Kindness, compassion, appreciative joy and equipoise &#8212; these are called the equanimity of the immeasurable states.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>If, on seeing a form, one, being indifferent, is neither glad nor sad, it is called the equanimity of the six members. The dwelling in the attainment of </span>
              <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="169" n="106"/>
              <span> equanimity because of dispassion is called the equanimity of the meditation (</span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>) factors. Equanimity-mindfulness purity is the equanimity of purity.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>And again, there are three kinds of equanimity: equanimity regarded as a vehicle of concentration; regarded as the state of little activity; and regarded as non-action. The equalized skilfulness that is present in all meditations, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;nas</em>
              <span>, and is neither hasty nor slow is &#8220;equanimity considered as a vehicle of concentration&#8221;. This inferior equanimity is near the second meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, and removes exultation of mind. If the mind is not active, it is called &#8220;equanimity regarded as a state of little activity&#8221;. This equanimity is near the third meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, and removes all exultation of mind. If one&#8217;s mind is not actively concerned with objects, through imperturbability of thought and body, it is called &#8220;equanimity regarded as non-action&#8221;. This equanimity is near the fourth meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>What are the salient characteristic, function, manifestation and near cause of equanimity? Equipoise is its salient characteristic. Non-attachment is its function. Non-action is its manifestation. Dispassion is its near cause.</span>

              <span>": It is called &#8220;third&#8221; because of the second. The third meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, comprises equanimity, mindfulness, the state of being completely conscious, bliss and unification of mind. The accomplishment of these is called (the third) meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>. &#8220;Abides in the attainment&#8221; means that one who acquires the third meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, separates from one factor, fulfils five factors, three kinds of goodness, ten characteristics and is associated with twenty-two merits.</span>

            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Now, a yogin, having practised the third meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, and acquired facility therein, wishes to cause the arising of the fourth meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, and to transcend the third meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>. (He thinks), &#8220;The third is coarse. The fourth is fine&#8221;. He sees the tribulations of the third meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, and the merits of the fourth meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>. What are the tribulations of the third meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>? Joy is the near enemy. Right concentration with bliss is coarse. So he is not able to acquire supernormal power. The third meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, does not partake of distinction. Thus he sees the tribulations of the third meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>. The merits of the fourth meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na,</em>
              <span> consist in the over-coming of these (tribulations).</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Thus the yogin, on seeing the tribulations of the third meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na, </em>
              <span>and the merits of the fourth meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, meditates on the </span>
              <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
              <span> sign and removes bliss at once. After removing it he can dwell with the mind of equanimity. Thus meditating his mind quickly attains to fixed meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, owing to equanimity.</span>

              <span> Therefore, the overcoming of pain and pleasure is taught as the accomplishment of the painless and pleasureless. And again, it is because in the fourth meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, attainment and overcoming occur together. And again, equanimity removes the defilements immediately and entirely. The attaining to the &#8220;painless&#8221; and &#8220;pleasureless&#8221; means that the mind does not receive and thought does not reject. This is called the attaining to the &#8220;painless&#8221; and &#8220;pleasureless&#8221;.</span>

            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Middleness is the salient characteristic. Dwelling in a middle position is the function. Abandoning is the manifestation. Removal of joy is the near cause.</span>

            <p>
              <span>What is the purity of equanimity-mindfulness? Neutrality is called equanimity. That is called equanimity. &#8220;Mindfulness&#8221; is called attentiveness, recollectedness and Right Mindfulness. These are called &#8220;mindfulness&#8221;. The mindfulness that is clarified and purified by equipoise is called &#8220;purity of equanimity-mindfulness&#8221;.</span>

              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> Here imperturbability and non-action are fulfilled, owing to the abandoning of all defilements and owing to resemblance and closeness to that attainment. This non-action is associated with equipoise. Therefore, mindfulness reaches imperturbability and fulfils impassivity. Therefore, this mindfulness is equanimity and acquires clarity and purity.</span>

              <em>jh&#257;na</em>

              <span> The yogin is like a man who has covered himself with a white cloth. Freed from all subtle defilements, he dwells in the fourth meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>. Thus should it be known. As the man who covers his body from head to foot with a white cloth is protected from extremes of heat and cold, experiences an even temperature and is undisturbed in body and mind, so that yogin who enters the fourth meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>

              <span>, wishes to enjoy the space-concentration and to transcend the realm of form. He considers thus: &#8220;Concentration of form is coarse; space- concentration is fine&#8221;. That yogin sees the tribulations of form and the merits of space-concentration. What are the tribulations of form? There are many (tribulations) such as the taking up of sticks and weapons, beating, quarrelling, slander, lying, maiming and the like. There are many sufferings such as pain of the eye and other bodily ills, cold and heat, hunger and thirst. These are the severe trials of the sensuous form.</span>

              <span>? The depending on form objects has satisfaction for near enemy. It is called coarse. One who is attached to form and delights in it cannot partake of distinction. But depending on space, one liberates oneself peacefully. In this concentration one fulfils the gross. Thus the yogin sees the tribulations of the fourth meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, in form. The merits of space-concentration consist of the overcoming of these.</span>

              <span> Why is it that only the surpassing of perception is taught and not the surpassing of feeling, formations and consciousness?</span>

            <p>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> If a man passes beyond perception of form, he passes beyond all the others; and if a man is not freed from perception of form, his mind is not capable of passing beyond the others. Hence the Blessed One taught the surpassing of perception of form with the intention of setting forth the surpassing of all form-objects, because all (form) objects of concentration are dependent on perception.</span>

              <span> If that does not happen (i.e., if he does not transcend the perception of form) is there or is there not perception of impact and diversity?</span>

            <p>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> There is the perception of impact and diversity in form concentration, because these are removed (later).</span>

              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> He dislikes form, therefore, he does not remove (these perceptions) in that (concentration). This is according to the teaching of the Buddha which says that, owing to the non-removal of these (perceptions of impact) in that (form concentration), sound is a thorn to one entering the first meditation, </span>

As dwelling in heaven is called heaven, so (dwelling in) the concentration of infinite consciousness is called the sphere of infinite consciousness. When this consciousness is held in concentration, it is called &#8220;the sphere of infinite consciousness&#8221;. &#8220;Enters into and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness&#8221; means that he surpasses the spatial object in that concentration of the sphere of infinite consciousness.

              <span>of goodness, ten characteristics and is associated with twenty-two merits, and dwells peacefully in the enjoyment of the reward of concentration. By reason of these good qualities, he is reborn in the sphere of nothingness. This was fully taught before. The merit by which a man is reborn in the sphere of nothingness is thus: He who practises the concentration of the sphere of nothingness will be reborn, after his death, in the sphere of nothingness. His life-span will be six thousand aeons.</span>

              <span> What are the tribulations of the sphere of nothingness? It has consciousness for near enemy. It is accompanied by coarse perception. Therefore it is gross. Owing to attachment to it one does not partake of distinction. Thus he sees the tribulations of the sphere of nothingness.

Through there being a remainder of fine perception, he enters the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception. Thus should &#8220;sphere&#8221; and &#8220;neither perception nor non-perception&#8221; be understood. &#8220;Enters into and abides&#8221;: He attains to the concentration of the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, passes beyond the sphere of nothingness, fulfils three factors, three kinds of goodness and ten characteristics, is associated with twenty-two merits and dwells in the enjoyment of the reward of concentration practice.

              <span>: a man is able to dive into the earth and come out of it easily; to shake palaces, mountains or the earth; to bring down rain; cause water to gush from his body and make that (water) appear as it were the ocean. The (other) benefits of the water </span>
              <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
              <span> are the same as those of the earth </span>
              <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
              <span>. One who practises the water </span>
              <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
              <span> well, sees water in all places.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>&#8220;How is the sign grasped&#8221;?: The man who accepts the water </span>
              <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
              <span> grasps the sign in water, i.e., natural or prepared water. Here, a practised yogin grasps the water sign in a place where there is no water or on seeing water in various places, i.e., in a well, pot, pond, swamp, river, lake or lagoon. Thus he can see (the sign) wherever he likes, and can arouse the after-image of water. He is unlike a new yogin. A new yogin has to grasp the sign in a prepared place. He is not able to practise the water </span>
              <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
              <span> with skill in an unprepared place. Thus that yogin, at first, should find out a calm place, in the monastery or in a rock cave or under a tree, which is not too dark and where the sun does not scorch. It should be a place where there is no dust or wind and where there are no mosquitoes, gadflies or other impediments. In such a place, he buries a bowl or a water pot in clean earth, and makes the rim level with the ground. The circumference should be one fathom. It should be filled with rain-water and unmixed with any colour. The bowl or pot should be full to the brim. Here, he should dwell on the perception of water, and take the sign through three ways: through even gazing, skilfulness and the elimination of disturbance. The rest is as fully-taught before under the earth </span>
              <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
              <span> and the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception.</span>

            <p>
              <span>&#8220;How is the sign grasped&#8221;?: The man who takes up the fire sign grasps the sign in fire, i.e., in a natural or a prepared place. Here, a practised yogin grasps the natural sign. (He grasps the sign) on seeing any fire, i.e., a grass-fire, a wood-fire, a forest-fire or a house that is on fire. He develops the natural or the prepared as he pleases and sees the appropriate sign. Thus the after-image of fire occurs to him. The new yogin is different. He is able to grasp the sign only in a prepared place and not in an unprepared place. He follows what is expedient in the practice of the fire </span>
              <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
              <span>. The new yogin should at first gather fuel, heap it up in a clean place and burn it. He burns it from below, at about the time the sun rises or sets. He does not think of the smoke or the flames that rise up. He sends his mind towards the fire sign by directing it to the middle of the thick flames and grasps the sign through three ways: through even gazing, skilfulness </span>

            <p>

            <p>
              <span>&#8220;How is the sign grasped?&#8221; : A new yogin grasps the air </span>
              <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
              <span> through two ways: through sight and touch. How does he grasp the sign through sight? That yogin, seeing a field of sweet potatoes, a bamboo grove or a grass-land moved by the wind, reflects on air perception. He grasps the sign through three ways: through even gazing, skilfulness and the elimination </span>
              <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="187" n="124"/>
              <span> of disturbance. Thus he grasps the sign through sight. How does he grasp the sign through touch? In a calm abode, a new yogin makes an opening in the wall, inserts a pipe of bamboo or reed into it and sits near it, letting the wind that comes through it touch his body. Thus he grasps the air sign through touch.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>A practised yogin is able to grasp the sign whenever the wind touches his body whether he is sitting, walking, standing or lying down. Thus the after-image of air occurs to him. He is unlike the new yogin.</span>

              <span> In the space </span>
              <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
              <span>, there are two kinds: The first is space that is separate from form; the second is space that is not separate from form. The sign of the space </span>
              <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
              <span> is space that is separate from form; the space sign that is grasped in an opening is space that is not separate from form. The training and the undisturbed dwelling of the mind &#8212; these are called the practising of it. Sending forth the mind into space perception is its function. Undivided thought is its near cause.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>&#8220;What are its benefits?&#8221;: There are two distinctive benefits, thus: A man is able to pass through obstructions such as walls, mountains and the like. His bodily activities are not impeded, and he becomes fearless.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>&#8220;How is the sign grasped?&#8221;: The man who takes up the space </span>
              <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
              <span>, grasps the sign in space that is natural or prepared. The practised yogin grasps the sign in a natural place. He sees the sign in various places &#8212; in some opening (in a wall), in the space of an open window, in the space which is between the branches of trees. Beginning with these, he sees it always, in pleasure and in pain. Thus the after-image of the space sign occurs to him. The new yogin is different. The new yogin grasps the sign in a prepared place; and not in a non-prepared place. This yogin goes to a calm abode on the outside of which are no obstructions. He makes a circular opening (in the wall) and grasps the space sign, through three ways: through even </span>

              <span> gazing, skilfulness and the elimination of disturbance. In this space </span>
              <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
              <span>, the fourth and the fifth meditations, </span>

                <span> The viewing of bloatedness with right knowledge &#8212; this is called &#8220;perception&#8221;. The training and the undisturbed dwelling of the mind in that perception &#8212; these are called the practising of it. The sending forth of the mind into the perception of bloatedness is its salient characteristic. The disgust connected with the perception of bloatedness is its function. Reflection on malodour and impurity are its near cause.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>&#8220;What are its benefits?&#8221;: Nine are the benefits of the perception of bloatedness, thus: A man is able to gain mindfulness as regards the interior of his body, is able to gain the perception of impermanence and the perception of death. He increases disgust and overcomes sense-desires. He removes the clinging to form and well-being. He fares well and approaches the ambrosial.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>&#8220;How is the sign grasped?&#8221;: The new yogin who grasps the sign of the putrescence of bloatedness goes alone, without a companion, established in mindfulness, undeluded, with his faculties drawn in and his mind not going to things outside, reflecting on the path of going and coming. Thus he goes to the place of putrescent corpses. Avoiding contrary winds, he remains there, standing or sitting, with the putrescent sign before him, and not too far from nor too near it. And that yogin makes a rock, an ant-hill, tree, bush or a creeper, near the place where the putrescent thing lies, one with the sign, one with the object, and considers thus: &#8220;This rock is impure, this is the impure sign, this is the rock&#8221;. And so also with the ant-hill and the others. </span>

He considers all sides of it. &#8220;From colour&#8221; means: &#8220;He determines black as black, the neither black nor white as neither black nor white. He determines white as white and malodorous skin as malodorous&#8221;. &#8220;From sex&#8221; means: &#8220;He determines whether it is the body of a male or a female, and whether it is that of a young, an adult or an old person&#8221;. To determine is to determine the long as long, the short as short, the fat as fat, the small as small. &#8220;From region&#8221; means: &#8220;He determines that in this direction is the head; in .this, a hand; in this, a leg; in this, the back; in this, the abdomen; in this, the sitting place; in this, the putrescent sign&#8221;. Thus he understands. &#8220;From locality&#8221; means: &#8220;He determines that on this place</span>

                <span> is the hand; on this, a leg; on this, the head; on this, the sitting-place; on this, the putrescent sign&#8221;. &#8220;From limitation&#8221; means: &#8220;He determines (the limit of the body) from head to foot, from below up to the head and the edge of the scalp, understanding the whole body as an assemblage of dung&#8221;. &#8220;From the joints&#8221; means: &#8220;He determines that there are six joints in the two hands, six joints in the two legs, and that there is one joint of the neck and one at the waist&#8221;. These are known as the fourteen great joints. &#8220;From the cavities&#8221; means: &#8220;He determines whether the mouth is open or closed, and whether the eyes are open or closed. He determines the hollows of the hands and the feet&#8221;. &#8220;From low parts and from high parts&#8221; means: &#8220;He determines whether the putrescent sign is m a low place or in a high place; and again, he determines thus: &#8216;I am in a low place, the putrescent sign is in a high place&#8217;, or, &#8216;The putrescent sign is in a low place, I am in a high place&#8217;. &#8220;He considers from all sides&#8221; means: &#8220;He determines a distance of two or three fathoms from the sign, because he does not grasp the sign by being too near it or too far from it, and considering all things, he grasps the sign (saying), &#8220;</span>
                <em>S&#257;dhu! s&#257;dhu!</em>
                <span>&#8221; Thus observing he is contented.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>That yogin having grasped the sign, noted it well and determined it well, goes alone, without a companion, established in mindfulness, undeluded, with his faculties drawn in and his mind not going to things outside, reflecting on the path of going and coming. To and fro he walks on the path or he sits absorbed in the putrescent sign.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Why does he go without a companion? It is for the sake of acquiring calmness of body. &#8220;Established in mindfulness&#8221; means: &#8220;Owing to non-delusion the faculties are drawn in and the mind does not go to things outside&#8221;.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Why does he reflect on the path of going and coming? It is for the sake of acquiring calmness of body. Why does he avoid contrary winds? It is for the sake of avoiding malodour. Why does he sit neither far nor near the sign? If he sits far, he cannot grasp the sign. If he sits near, he cannot </span>

                <span> get a dislike for it, or see its nature. If he does not know its nature, he is not able to grasp that sign. Therefore, he sits neither too far from nor too near it. Why does he consider the sign on all sides? It is for the sake of non-delusion. Non-delusion is thus: When a yogin goes to a still place and sees the putrescent sign, fear arises in him; at such a time, if the corpse appears to stand up before him, he does not stand up, but reflects. In this way he knows, recollects, rightly understands, regards well and fully investigates the sign. In the same way he considers all signs. This is (the indication of) non-delusion.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
                <span> Why does he grasp the sign in ten ways? </span>
                <span rend="bold">A.</span>
                <span> It is for the sake of binding the mind.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Why does one reflect on the path of going and coming? It is for the sake of progress in the course. &#8220;Progress in the course&#8221; means: &#8220;Though a yogin enters a still place, his mind is sometimes disturbed. If he does not always investigate it, the putrescent sign does not arise. Therefore, a yogin investigates the sign with all his heart by reflecting on the path of going and coming. He investigates the place of meditation. He investigates all signs. Thus should he investigate the sign to be grasped, in the ten ways.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>That yogin thus investigates again and again, and sees the sign as if it were with his eyes. This is (the indication of) progress in the course. A new yogin, meditating on a corpse, perceiving (it as) a jewel, rejoices, bears it in mind, resorts to it always, causes the hindrances to perish and arouses the factors of meditation, </span>
                <em>jh&#257;na</em>
                <span>. Remote form sense-desires and demeritorious states, he abides in the attainment of the first meditation, </span>
                <em>jh&#257;na</em>
                <span>, which is with initial and sustained application of thought, born of solitude and full of joy and bliss, through the perception of putrescence.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
                <span> Why is the first meditation, </span>
                <em>jh&#257;na</em>
                <span>, only developed through the perception of putrescence and not any other meditation, </span>
                <em>jh&#257;na</em>
                <span>?</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span rend="bold">A.</span>
                <span> This perception always follows initial and sustained application of thought because (they go together) and because it is tied down to a place. When initial and sustained application of thought are present, this sign becomes manifest. Without initial and sustained application of thought, the yogin is not able, here, to gain the calming of the mind. Therefore, the first meditation, </span>
                <em>jh&#257;na</em>
                <span>, is developed and not any other.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>And again, it is said that colour, sex and the others of this putrescent sign are considered in many ways. &#8220;Are considered in many ways&#8221;: These (colour, etc.) are objects of initial and sustained application of thought. Separate from initial and sustained application of thought, these cannot be considered. Therefore, only the first meditation, </span>
                <em>jh&#257;na</em>
                <span>, is developed and not any other.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>And again, it is said that this putrescent sign is an unenduring object. On an unenduring object the mind does not go higher. In an impure place joy and bliss can only arise by the rejection of initial and sustained application </span>
                <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="198" n="135"/>
                <span> of thought, which, in a place such as this, depend on malodour. Therefore, only the first meditation, </span>
                <em>jh&#257;na</em>
                <span>, is developed and not any other.</span>

                <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
                <span> On an unenduring object how do joy and bliss occur?</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span rend="bold">A.</span>
                <span> The unenduring object is not the cause of joy and bliss. And again, joy and bliss arise owing to the removal of the heat of the hindrances and the training of the mind. The rest is as was fully taught above.</span>

                <span> What are the miscellaneous teachings regarding putrescence?</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span rend="bold">A.</span>
                <span> The beginner, being one who is affected by severe passion, should not grasp the sign in that which is not of the same kind. That which is &#8220;not of the same kind&#8221; means: &#8220;Like the body of a man to a woman&#8221;.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>If one is of a calling associated with the perception of putrescence, he should not grasp the putrescent sign, because he, owing to the close connection with these objects, does not develop the idea of their disagreeableness. One does not cause the arising of pure perception on the bodies of beasts (?). One causes the arising of the sign in one bone and grasps the sign in the bone with facility.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>And again, if a man grasps the sign of putrescence through colour, he should meditate on the </span>
                <em>kasi&#7751;a</em>
                <span>. If a man grasps the sign of putrescence through space, he should meditate on that element. If a man grasps the sign of putrescence through putrescence, he should meditate on putrescence.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
                <span> Why are there ten putrescences and neither more nor less?</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span rend="bold">A.</span>
                <span> Because the faults of the body are of ten kinds and because there are ten kinds of perception owing to ten kinds of persons. A passionate person should meditate on the perception of bloatedness. A sensual person should meditate on discolouration. A passionate lover of the beautiful should always meditate on the festering. The others should be understood in the same way.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>And again, the sign of putrescence is grasped with difficulty. All signs of putrescence are means of overcoming passion. Therefore, whenever the walker in passion sees the putrescent sign, he should grasp it. Because of these reasons, it is said that among the putrescences there are ten kinds of putrescence perception. </span>

              </p>
              <p>
                <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
                <span> Why are these (putrescence signs) not increased?</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span rend="bold">A.</span>
                <span> When a man wishes to separate from passion, he causes the arising of the perception regarding the nature of his body. Because, if he has the perception of the nature of his body, he can quickly acquire the perception of its disagreeableness and cause the arising of the after-image. If the perception of putrescence is increased, the sign which he has grasped in his body will disappear. If he loses the perception of his own body, he will not be able to acquire the thought of disagreeableness quickly. Therefore, he should not increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>And again, it is taught that if a man is without passion, he may increase it for the sake of developing the great thought. This is in accordance with the teaching of the </span>
                <em>Abhidhamma</em>
                <span>: &#8220;One dwells without passion and the rest, practises the first meditation, </span>

He is perfect in conduct, because he has become the eye of the world and because he has blessed those who were unblessed. He is perfectly enlightened through knowledge, because he has become the mainstay of the world and because he has rescued the fear-stricken. He saves through conduct, because he has acquired the supernormal power of the highest truth. He, without a teacher, has acquired that excellent equipose of behaviour towards all things, because he has promoted the weal of the world.

                <em>Nibb&#257;na</em>

                <em>Nibb&#257;na</em>
                <span>. What are the practices leading to extinction, </span>

                <span>? Namely, the four foundations of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the five powers, the seven factors of enlightenment, the Noble Eightfold Path &#8212; these are called the practices leading to </span>
                <em>Nibb&#257;na</em>
                <span>. The recollection of the Law is the virtue of renunciation and the virtue of the Way. This recollection is recollectedness and right recollectedness. Thus is recollection of the Law to be understood. The undisturbed dwelling of the mind (in this recollection) is the practising of it. The awareness of the virtues of the Law is its salient characteristic. Analysis of the Law is its function. The understanding of the meaning is its near cause. Its benefits are equal to those of the recollection of the Buddha.</span>

                <span>&#8220;What is the procedure?&#8221;: The new yogin goes to a place of solitude and keeps his mind undisturbed. With undisturbed mind, he recollects thus: The Law is well-taught by the Blessed One, is visible, not subject to time, inviting, conducive to perfection, to be attained by the wise, each one for himself.</span>

                <span> The congregation of the saints is the Community of Bhikkhus. This is called the Community of Bhikkhus. The yogin recollects the virtue of the observances of the Community of Bhikkhus. This recollection is recollectedness and right recollectedness.

Awareness of the virtues of the Community of Bhikkhus is its salient characteristic; reverence is its function; appreciation of the virtues of the Community of Bhikkhus is its near cause.

              <p>
                <span>And again, the yogin should recollect through other ways thus: This Community of Bhikkhus is the congregation that is most excellent and good. It is called the best. It is endowed with virtue, concentration, wisdom, freedom and the knowledge of freedom. That yogin recollects these various virtues in different ways. Through this recollection of the various virtues, he becomes confident. Owing to the recollection of confidence, his mind is undisturbed. With undisturbed mind he is able to destroy the hindrances, arouse the meditation (</span>

                <span> Liberality means that one gives one&#8217;s wealth to others wishing to benefit them, and in order to derive the happiness of benefiting others. Thus is liberality to be understood. One dwells indifferent in the recollection of the virtue of liberality. This recollectedness is recollection and right recollectedness. This is called recollection of liberality. The undisturbed dwelling of the mind in this recollection is the practising of it. Awareness of the merit of liberality is its salient characteristic. Non-miserliness is its function. Non-covetousness is its near cause.</span>

                <span>A man who practises the recollection of liberality gains ten benefits thus: He gains bliss through liberality; he becomes non-covetous through liberality; </span>

                <span> he is not miserly, thinks of others, becomes dear to others, does not fear in others&#8217; company, has much joy, acquires the compassionate mind, fares well and approaches the ambrosial.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>&#8220;What is the procedure?&#8221;: The new yogin goes to a place of solitude and keeps his mind undisturbed. With undisturbed mind he practises recollection of liberality thus: &#8220;Through abandoning things I have benefitted others; therefrom I have gained much merit. The vulgar, by reason of the dirt of covetousness, are drawn to things. I live with mind non-coveting and not unclean. Always I give and enjoy giving to others. Always I give and distribute&#8221;.</span>

He sees various forms such as smoke, mist, dust, sand of gold, or he experiences something similar to the pricking of a needle or to an ant&#8217;s bite. If his mind does not become clear regarding these different images, he will be confused. Thus he fulfils overturning and does not gain the perception of respiration. If his mind becomes clear, the yogin does not experience confusion. He attends to respiration and he does not cause the arising of other perceptions. Meditating thus he is able to end confusion and acquire the subtle image. And he attends to respiration with mind that is free. That image is free. Because that image is free, desire arises. Desire being free, that yogin attends to respiration and becomes joyful. Desire and joy being free, he attends to respiration with equipoise. Equipoise, desire and joy being free, he attends to respiration, and his mind is not disturbed. If his mind is not disturbed, he will destroy the hindrances, and arouse the meditation (</span>

              <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
              <span> What is counting? </span>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> A new yogin counts the breaths from one to ten, beginning with the outgoing breath and ending with the incoming breath. He does not count beyond ten. Again, it is taught that he counts from one to five but does not count beyond five. He does not miss. At that time (i.e., when he misses) he should count (the next) or stop that count. Thus he dwells in mindfulness of respiration, attending to the object. Thus should counting be understood.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>&#8220;Connection&#8221;: Having counted, he follows respiration with mindfulness, continuously. This is called connection. </span>
              <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="223" n="160"/>
              <span> </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>&#8220;Contacting&#8221;: Having caused the arising of air perception, he dwells, attending to the contact of respiration at the nose-tip or on the lip. This is called contacting.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>&#8220;Fixing&#8221;: Having acquired facility in contacting, he should establish the image, and he should establish joy and bliss and other states which arise here. Thus should fixing be known.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>That counting suppresses uncertainty. It causes the abandoning of uncertainty. Connection removes gross discursive thinking and causes unbroken mindfulness of respiration. Contacting removes distraction and makes for steady perception. One attains to distinction through bliss.</span>

              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> The new yogin gains tranquillity of body and mind and abides in mindfulness of respiration. The respirations become subtle. Because of subtility they are hard to lay hold of. If at that time, the yogin&#8217;s breathing is long, he, through fixing, knows it is long. If the image arises he considers it through its own nature. Thus should non-confusion be known. And again he should consider the breaths, whether long or short (as the case may be). Thus should he practise. And again, the yogin causes the arising of the clear image through the object. Thus should one practise.</span>

              <span>(3) &#8220;Experiencing the whole body, I breathe in&#8217;, thus he trains himself&#8221;: In two ways he knows the whole body, through non-confusion and through the object. </span>
              <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
              <span> What is the knowledge of the whole body through non-confusion? </span>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> A yogin practises mindfulness of respiration and develops concentration through contact accompanied by joy and bliss. Owing to the experiencing of contact accompanied by joy and bliss the whole body becomes non-confused. </span>
              <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
              <span> What is the knowledge of the whole body through the object? </span>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> The incoming breath and the outgoing breath comprise the bodily factors dwelling in one sphere. The object of respiration and the mind and the mental properties are called &#8220;body&#8221;. These bodily factors are called &#8220;body&#8221;.</span>

              <span>And again, practice means attaining to a state (of meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>) through mindfulness of respiration. This is practice. Through this mindfulness of respiration, one attains to the state which is with (-out, even) initial application of thought. That is the state which is with initial and sustained application of thought, and the state of sustained application of thought.</span>

              <span> The foundation of mindfulness which begins with the long incoming Breath and the long outgoing breath is the reviewing of the body. That which begins with the experiencing of joy is the reviewing of feeling. That which begins with the experiencing of the mind is the reviewing of thought. That which begins with the discernment of impermanence is the reviewing of states. Thus one who practises mindfulness of respiration fulfils the four foundations of mindfulness.</span>

              <span>How are the seven enlightenment factors fulfilled through the practice of the four foundations of mindfulness? If the yogin practises the (four) foundations of mindfulness, he is able to abide non-confused in mindfulness; this is called the enlightenment factor of mindfulness. That yogin, abiding in mindfulness, investigates subjection to ill, impermanence and phenomena; this is called the enlightenment factor of inquiry into states. Inquiring into states (</span>

              <span>) thus, he strives earnestly without slackening; this is called the enlightenment factor of exertion. Developing exertion, he arouses joy that is clean; this is called the enlightenment factor of joy. Through the mind being full of joy, his body and mind are endowed with calm; this is called the enlightenment factor of calm. Through calmness his body attains to ease and his mind is possessed of concentration; this is called the enlightenment factor of concentration. Owing to concentration, the mind acquires equanimity; this is called the enlightenment factor of equanimity. Thus because of the </span>

Therefore in mindfulness of respiration, the suppression of discursive thinking is taught.</span>

            <p>
              <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
              <span> What is mindfulness of death? What is the practising of it? What are its salient characteristic, function and near cause? What are its benefits? What is the procedure?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> The cutting off of the life-faculty &#8212; this is called death. The undisturbed mindfulness of this &#8212; this is called the practising of it. The cutting off of one&#8217;s life is its salient characteristic. Disagreeableness is its function. Well-being is its near cause.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>What are its benefits? He who practises mindfulness of death is possessed of diligence as regards the higher meritorious states, and of dislike as regards the demeritorious. He does not hoard clothes and ornaments. He is not stingy. He is able to live long, does not cling to things, is endowed with the perception of impermanence, the perception of subjection to ill and the perception of not-self. He fares well and approaches the ambrosial. When he comes to die, he does not suffer bewilderment.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>What is the procedure? The new yogin enters a place of solitude and guards his thoughts. He considers the death of beings with mind undistracted thus: &#8220;I shall die; I shall enter the realm of death; I shall not escape death&#8221;. Thus it is taught in the Nettipada Sutta:</span>

              <span> &#8220;If a man wishes to meditate on death, he should contemplate a person who is on the point of being killed and he should know the causes of death&#8221;.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Here there are four kinds in mindfulness of death: (1) Associated with anxiety. (2) Associated with fear. (3) Associated with indifference. (4) Associated with wisdom.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>The mindfulness associated with the loss of one&#8217;s own beloved child is associated with anxiety. The mindfulness connected with the sudden death </span>
              <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="230" n="167"/>
              <span> of one&#8217;s own child is associated with fear. The mindfulness of death by a burner (of corpses) is associated with indifference. Remembering (the nature of) the world, one develops aversion &#8212; this is called associated with wisdom. Here the yogin should not practise the mindfulness associated with anxiety, fear or indifference, because </span>
              <pb ed="PTS" n="432"/>
              <span> through </span>
              <span>them he is not able to remove tribulation. Tribulation can only be removed through the mindfulness associated with wisdom.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>There are three kinds of death thus: death according to general opinion, death as a complete cutting off, momentary death. What is &#8220;death according to general opinion&#8221;? Death as it is understood in common parlance. This is called &#8220;death according to general opinion&#8221;. &#8220;Death as a complete cutting off&#8221; means: &#8220;The Consummate One has cut off the defilements&#8221;. &#8220;Momentary death&#8221; means: &#8220;The momentary perishing of all formations&#8221;.</span>

              <span>And again, there are two kinds in death: untimely death and timely death. Death through suicide, murder or disease, or through being cut off in the prime of life without (assignable) cause is called untimely death. Death through the exhaustion of the life-span or through old age is called timely death.</span>

              <span> through inference; through the body being common to the many; through the weakness of the life-principle; through the distinguishing, of time; through the absence of the sign; through the shortness of the moment. How should one practise mindfulness of death &#8220;through the presence of a murderer&#8221;? </span>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> Like a man who is being taken to a place to be killed. When that man sees the murderer drawing out a sword and following him, he thinks thus: &#8220;This man intends to kill me; I shall be killed at any moment; I shall be killed at any step. I shall surely be killed if I turn back. I shall surely be killed if I sit down; I shall surely be killed if I sleep&#8221;. Thus should the yogin practise mindfulness of death &#8220;through the presence of a murderer&#8221;. </span>
              <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
              <span> How should one practise mindfulness of death &#8220;through the absence of an efficient cause&#8221;? There is no cause or skill that can make life immortal. When the sun and the moon rise, no cause or skill can make them turn back. Thus the yogin practises mindfulness of death. </span>

              <span> Many kings who possessed great treasures, great vehicle-kings, Mah&#257; Sudassana of great supernormal power, Mandh&#257;tu and all other kings entered the state of death. And again, many sages of old, Vessamitta and Yamataggi, who possessed </span>

              <span> great supernormal power and who caused fire and water to issue forth from their bodies, also entered the state of death. Great hearers of old like the Venerable Elders S&#257;riputta, Moggall&#257;na and others, who were possessed of immense wisdom and power also entered the state of death. Many Paccekabuddhas who attained enlightenment without owning a teacher, and who were endowed with all virtue, also entered the state of death. And again, they who come and go in the same way, the Consummate, Supremely Enlightened, Matchless Ones, endowed with knowledge and conduct, who have won the further shore of merit &#8212; many such also entered the state of death. How shall I with my brief life-span escape entry into the state of death? Thus the yogin practises mindfulness of death &#8220;through inference&#8221;. </span>

              <span> Through the disorder of wind and phlegm, the state of death is fulfilled. Through the disturbance of many worms or through lack of drink and food, the state of death is fulfilled. Or through being bitten by poisonous snakes, centipedes, millepedes, or rats, death is fulfilled. Or through being mauled by a lion, a tiger or a leopard, or through being attacked by a demon (n&#257;ga), or through being gored by a cow, death is fulfilled. Or through being killed by humans or non-humans, death is fulfilled. Thus one practises mindfulness of death &#8220;through the body being common to the many&#8221;. </span>

That yogin through these ways practises mindfulness of death and develops (the perception of) disagreeableness.

              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> The perception of the passing away of the aggregations is called the perception of impermanence. The mindfulness of the destruction of the faculties is called mindfulness of death. The practice of the perception of impermanence and the perception of not-self is called the rejection of pride. He who practises mindfulness of death can dwell in the perception of impermanence and the perception of subjection to ill through the thought of the cutting off of life and the destruction of the mind. These are the differences between them.</span>

              <span>In the twenty-fifth week the seventeen thousand textures of the skin are formed.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>In the twenty-sixth week the body is endowed with hardness,</span>
            </p>

              <span>In the twenty-seventh week the body is endowed with the powers.</span>

              <span>In the twenty-eighth week the ninety-nine thousand pores are produced.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>In the twenty-ninth week the whole is completed. And again it is taught that in the seventh week the child&#8217;s body is complete, that it leans back with hanging head in a crouching position. In the forty-second week, by the aid of the </span>
              <em>kamma</em>
              <span>-produced wind, it reverses its position, turns its feet upwards and its head down and goes to </span>
              <span>the gate of birth. At this time it is born. In the world it is commonly known as a being. Thus one should reflect on the nature of the body through &#8220;gradual formation&#8221;.</span>

              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> Peace is the stilling of the movements of the mind and body. Complete stilling is called peace. One recalls peace to mind, well. This is recollectedness, recollection and right recollectedness. This is called the recollection </span>
              <span>of peace. The undisturbed dwelling of the mind in this recollection is called the practising of it. The manifestation of lasting merit is its salient characteristic. Non-restlessness is its function. Sublime freedom is its near cause.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>What are its benefits? When a man practises the recollection of peace, happily he sleeps, happily he awakes, is endowed with calm. His faculties are tranquil and he is able to fulfil his aspirations. He is pleasant of </span>

              <span>What is the procedure? The new yogin enters into a place of solitude and sits down with mind intent (on the recollection of peace) and undisturbed. If this bhikkhu calms his faculties, his mind will be quietened and he will enjoy tranquillity immediately. This bhikkhu sees and hears, through bodily, verbal and mental action, through the recollection of peace and through the merits of peace. It was taught by the Blessed One thus: &#8220;That bhikkhu is endowed with virtue, endowed with concentration, endowed with wisdom, endowed with freedom and is endowed with the knowledge of freedom.

              <span> As parents, on seeing their dear and only child, arouse thoughts of loving-kindness and benevolence towards that child, so one arouses thoughts of loving-kindness and benevolence towards all beings. Thus is loving-kindness to be known. The undisturbed dwelling of the mind in this practice is called the practising of it. To cause the arising of benevolence is its salient characteristic. The thought of loving-kindness is its function. Non-hatred is its manifestation. If a man practises loving-kindness, he is benefitted in eleven ways thus: Happily he sleeps; happily he awakes; he does not see bad dreams; he is dear to humans; he is dear to non-humans; deities protect him; fire, poison, sword and stick come not near him; he concentrates his mind quickly; the colour of his face is pleasingly bright; at the time of death he is not bewildered; if he attains not the sublime state, he is reborn in the world of Brahma.</span>

              <span>What is the procedure? The new yogin who aspires to practise loving-kindness, should at first reflect on the disadvantages of anger and resentment and on the advantages of patience and bear patience in mind. What is meant by &#8220;should at first reflect on the disadvantages of anger and resentment&#8221;? If a man arouses anger and resentment, his thoughts of loving-kindness will be consumed and his mind will become impure. Thereafter he will frown; thereafter he will utter harsh words; thereafter he will stare in the four directions; thereafter he will lay hold of stick and sword; thereafter he will convulse with rage and spit blood; thereafter he will hurl valuables hither and thither; thereafter he will break many things; thereafter he will kill others or kill himself. And again, if a man is angry and resentful always, he, owing to his wicked mind, is liable to kill his parents, or kill a Consummate One or </span>
              <span>cause a schism in the Community of Bhikkhus, or draw blood from the body of an Enlightened One. Such fearful acts is he liable to do. Thus should one reflect.</span>

(Further, one reflects thus :) When a wise man grows angry and resentful, he inflicts severe sufferings. So he will be poisoned out of the fear of terrible punishment. If a man who is bitten by a snake has the antidote and refrains from taking it, he is like one who seems to relish suffering and not happiness. In the same way, a bhikkhu who arouses anger and resentment and does not suppress these, quickly, is said to be one who relishes suffering and not happiness, because he accumulates more fearful </span>

And again, one should reflect on anger and resentment thus: He who arouses anger and resentment will be laughed at by his enemies, and cause his friends to be ashamed of him. Though he may have deep virtue, he will be slighted by others. If he was honoured before, he will be despised hereafter. Aspiring after happiness, he will acquire misery.

I have knowledge; this patience is the sphere of knowledge in me. If there is the poison of anger and resentment in me, this patience is the antidote which will counteract the poison in me. Thus one should reflect on the disadvantages of anger and resentment and on the advantages of patience, and resolve: &#8220;I will reach patience. When people blame me, I will be patient.

              <span> Thus the yogin proceeds towards the bliss of patience and benefits himself. He enters into a place of solitude, and with mind undisturbed begins to fill his body (with the thought) thus: &#8220;I am happy. My mind admits no suffering&#8221;. What is meant by &#8220;I have no enemy; I have no anger; I am happily free from all defilements and perform all good&#8221;.? That yogin controls his mind and makes it pliant. He makes his mind capable of attainment. If his mind is pliant, and is able to bear the object, he should practise loving-kindness. He should regard all beings as (he regards) himself. In practising loving-kindness towards all beings, the yogin cannot at the start develop loving-kindness for enemies, wicked </span>
              <span>men, beings without merit and dead men. That yogin develops loving-kindness for one towards whom he behaves with respectful reserve, whom he honours, whom he does not slight, towards whom he is not indifferent, and by whom he has been benefitted and, therefore, in regard to whom he is not jealous or ill-disposed. He should develop loving-kindness for such a one, thus: &#8220;I esteem a man who is of such and such a nature, namely, a man endowed with honour, learning, virtue, concentration and wisdom. I am benefitted through alms, sweet speech, liberality and intentness on that. These are of advantage to me&#8221;. Thus he recalls to mind the virtues he esteems </span>
              <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="247" n="184"/>
              <span> and the benefits he has acquired (in and through that one), and develops loving-kindness towards that one. One should develop the benevolent mind and always reflect and investigate. One should have a mind that is without anger and resentment. One should wish to be endowed with tranquillity, to be free from hatred, to be endowed with all merits and to gain good advantages. One should wish to gain a good reward, a good name, to gain confidence, to gain happiness, to be endowed with virtue, knowledge, liberality and wisdom. One should wish for happy sleep and happy awaking. One should wish to have no evil dreams. One should wish to become dear to humans and to be honoured by them. One should wish to become dear to non-humans and to be honoured by them. One should wish to be protected by the gods; to be untouched by fire, poison, sword or stick and the like; to concentrate the mind quickly; to have a pleasant complexion; to be born in the Middle Country;</span>

If he does not develop loving-kindness for an indifferent person or is unable to do so and develops dislike, he should reflect thus: &#8220;In me are states of demerit. I have dislike. Wishing to acquire merit, I stirred up confidence and was ordained. And again, I said, &#8216;I will develop great loving-kindness and compassion for the weal of all beings, through the merit of the Great Teacher&#8217;. If I cannot develop loving-kindness towards one indifferent person, how shall I develop loving-kindness towards enemies?&#8221; If that yogin is still unable to destroy dislike and hate, that yogin should not endeavour to develop loving-kindness, but should adopt another way to remove the hatred he has for that person.</span>

              <span>Thus after that yogin has clearly understood the way of destroying hatred, has identified friends, indifferent ones and enemies with himself, and acquired facility in the practice, he should gradually arouse the thought of loving-kindness and develop it for various bhikkhus in (his) dwelling-place. After that he should develop loving-kindness for the Community of Bhikkhus in (his) dwelling-place. After that he should develop loving-kindness for the deities in his dwelling-place. After that he should develop loving-kindness for beings in the village outside his dwelling-place. Thus (he develops loving-kindness for beings) from village to village, from country to country. After that he should develop (loving-kindness for beings) in one direction. That yogin &#8220;pervades one quarter with thoughts of loving-kindness; and after that, the second; and after that, the third; and after that, the fourth. Thus he spreads loving-kindness towards all beings of the four directions, above, below and pervades the whole world with thoughts of loving-kindness immense immeasurable, without enmity, without ill will.</span>

Through two causes one fails in the practice of loving-kindness: through regarding friends as enemies and through impure affection. &#8220;Non-fulfilment&#8221; is produced when one arouses the feeling of enmity and rivalry.

              <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
              <span> What is appreciative joy? What is the practising of it? What are its salient characteristic, function and manifestation? What are its benefits? What is the procedure?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> As parents, who, on seeing the happiness of their dear and only child are glad, and say, &#8220;</span>
              <em>S&#257;dhu!</em>
              <span>&#8221; so, one develops appreciative joy for all beings. Thus should appreciative joy be known. The undisturbed dwelling of the mind in appreciative joy &#8212; this is called the practising of it. Gladness is its salient characteristic. Non-fear is its function. Destruction of dislike is its manifestation. Its benefits are equal to those of loving-kindness.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>What is the procedure? The new yogin enters a place of solitude and sits down with mind collected and undisturbed. When one sees or hears that some person&#8217;s qualities are esteemed by others, and that he is at peace and is joyful, one thinks thus: &#8220;</span>
              <em>S&#257;dhu! s&#257;dhu!</em>
              <span> may he continue joyful for a long time!&#8221;. And again, when one sees or hears that a certain person does not follow demeritorious doctrines, or that he does not follow undesirable doctrines and that he follows desirable doctrines, one thinks thus: &#8220;</span>
              <em>S&#257;dhu! s&#257;dhu!</em>
              <span> may he continue joyful for a. long time!&#8221;. That yogin by these means and through these activities develops the thought of appreciative joy and repeats it. Having by these means and through these activities developed the thought of appreciative joy and repeated it, he makes his mind pliant, and capable of bearing the object. Thereafter he gradually develops appreciative joy for an indifferent person and an enemy. The rest is as was fully taught above. Thus with appreciative joy he fills the four directions.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
              <span> What is the fulfilment of appreciative joy? What is its non-fulfilment?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> When one fulfils appreciative joy, he removes unhappiness, does not arouse impure affection and does not speak untruth. Through two causes appreciative joy is not fulfilled: through resentment produced within himself and derisive action. The rest is as was fully taught above.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> As parents are neither too attentive nor yet inattentive towards any one of their children, but regard them equally and maintain an even mind towards them, so through equanimity one maintains an even mind towards all beings. Thus should equanimity be known. The dwelling undisturbed in equanimity&#8212;this is called the practising of it. Non-attachment is its salient characteristic. Equality is its function. The suppression of disliking and liking is its manifestation. Its benefits are equal to those of loving-kindness.</span>

            <p>
              <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
              <span> What is the procedure? That yogin at first attends to the third meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, with loving-kindness, with compassion and with appreciative joy. Having attained to the third meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, and acquired facility therein, he sees the severe trials of loving-kindness, compassion and appreciative joy. Liking and disliking are near. These (loving-kindness etc.) are connected with fawning, elation and gladness. The merits of equanimity lie in the overcoming of these severe trials. That yogin, having seen the severe trials of loving-kindness, compassion and appreciative joy and the merits of equanimity, develops equanimity towards a neutral person</span>

              <span>taught above. Thus he fills the four directions. That yogin practising thus attains to the fourth meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, through equanimity. In three ways he attains to fixed meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, through comprehending beings, through comprehending village-domains and through comprehending all directions.</span>

            <p>
              <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
              <span> When the yogin practises equanimity, how does he consider beings? </span>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> The yogin considers thus: &#8220;In loving-kindness, compassion and appreciative joy, one is overjoyed with beings&#8221;, and removing joy, he induces equanimity. As a man might leap for joy on meeting a long-lost friend </span>
              <pb ed="PTS" n="438"/>
              <span> and later, calm down, having been with him for sometime, so having lived long with loving-kindness, compassion and appreciative joy, the yogin attains to equanimity. And again, there is a man. He speaks concerning beings, &#8220;Beings consider thus: What is the fulfilment of equanimity? What is its non-fulfilment?&#8221; When equanimity is fulfilled, one destroys disliking and liking and does not cause the arising of ignorance. Through two causes equanimity is not fulfilled: through resentment produced within oneself and through the arising of ignorance.</span>

              <span> Through constant dwelling on the sorrows (of others) one develops loving-kindness, compassion and appreciative joy. (And so no equanimity is present). Therefore the third meditation, </span>

              <span>, and not the fourth, is produced. And again, it is said that the four meditations, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;nas</em>
              <span>, are produced with the four immeasurables.

              <span> Were that so, uncertainty might arise concerning all. And again, in order to overcome hatred, cruelty, dislike and lust, one accomplishes the four immeasurables. And again, it is said that these four are (overcome with) only loving-kindness. If one arouses (in oneself) hatred, cruelty, unhappiness, one, through suppressing them in the four ways, attains to distinction.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Equanimity is the purification of loving-kindness, compassion and appreciative joy, because through it hatred and lust are destroyed.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Further, it should be understood that the four immeasurables are of one nature though their signs are different. Thus owing to the suppression of tribulation, owing to the object which comprises beings, owing to the wish to benefit, they fulfil one characteristic. </span>

If one does not practise equanimity, he will be attached (to things) and (think), &#8220;This being gets happiness&#8221;, (or this being) &#8220;gets suffering&#8221;. Or he depends on joy or bliss.

              <span> To discern the four elements within one&#8217;s form &#8212; this is called distinguishing the four elements. The undisturbed dwelling of the mind (in determining) &#8212; this is called the practising of it. Close investigation of the four elements is its salient characteristic.

That yogin, having understood the whole body through understanding the veins, their colour, their form, their place, understands the whole body through understanding the bones, their colour, their form, their place. That yogin in these four ways dominates his mind. After dominating his mind, he makes his mind pliant and capable of bearing the object. That yogin, having in these four ways dominated his mind and having made his mind pliant and capable of bearing the object, in these four (other) ways knows that which has the nature of solidity as the element of earth; that which has the nature of humidity as the element of water; that which has the nature of heat as the element of fire; that which has the nature of motion as the element of air. Thus that yogin, in these four ways, knows that there are only elements and that there is no being and no soul. Here the other ways also are fulfilled. Thus one grasps the elements briefly.</span>

              <span> What are called primaries are neither male nor female. They are seen through the form of a man or a woman. And element is neither long nor short.

Through the union of the earthy element hardness is fulfilled. Through the union of the watery element fluidity is fulfilled. Through the union of the fiery element heat is fulfilled.

              <span>How should one determine the four primaries through &#8220;aggregation&#8221;? Aggregation consists of the earth-element, the water-element, the fire-element and the air-element. By means of these elements form, smell, taste and touch take place. These eight are produced generally together; they co-exist and do not go apart. This combination is named aggregation. And again, there are four kinds, namely, aggregation of earth, aggregation of water, aggregation of fire and aggregation of air. In the aggregation of earth, the earth-element predominates; and the water-element, the fire-element and the air-element gradually, in order, become less. In the aggregation of water, the water-element predominates ; and the earth-element, the air-element and the fire-element gradually, in order, become less. In the aggregation of fire, the fire-element predominates; and the earth-element, the air-element and the water-element gradually, in order, become less.

Thus these puppets are called bodies; the master of puppets is the past defilement by which this body is made complete; the strings are the tendons; the clay is flesh; the paint is the skin; the interstices are space. (By) jewels, raiment and ornaments (they) are called men and women. Thoughts (of men and women) are to be known as the tugging by the element of air. Thus they walk, dwell, go out, or come in, stretch out, draw in, converse or speak.</span>

He sees the merit of the destruction of suffering through wisdom, tranquillity and dispassion. In this way that yogin, seeing the tribulation of suffering and the merits of cessation, dwells peacefully endowed with the faculties, the powers and the factors of enlightenment.</span>

Further, he sees that these beings are the recipients of various forms of suffering and are killed or deprived of liberty. And again, he sees that such beings commit diverse evil actions such as eagerly searching for things, deceiving and pretending to be energetic. Thus these beings perform evil. Seeing food thus, he develops dislike through the thought: &#8220;Impure urine and excrement are due to drink and food&#8221;.</span>

            <span> What is the supernormal power diffused by knowledge? </span>
            <span rend="bold">A.</span>
            <span> By the view of impermanence, one rejects the perception of permanence and accomplishes the supernormal power diffused by knowledge. By the Path of Sanctity, one rejects all defilements and accomplishes the supernormal power diffused by knowledge. Thus should supernormal power diffused by knowledge be understood. It is as in the case of Venerable Elder Bakkula, of the Venerable Elder Sa&#7749;kicca and of the Venerable Elder Bh&#363;tap&#257;la. Thus is supernormal power diffused by knowledge.</span>

            <span> By the first meditation, </span>
            <em>jh&#257;na</em>
            <span>, one rejects the hindrances and accomplishes the supernormal power diffused by concentration. By the attainment of the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, one rejects the perception of nothingness and accomplishes the supernormal power diffused by concentration. It is as in the case of the Venerable Elder S&#257;riputta, of the Venerable Elder Kh&#257;&#7751;uko&#7751;&#7693;a&#241;&#241;a, of the lay-sister Uttar&#257; and of the lay-sister S&#257;m&#257;vat&#299;.

            <span> Here if a bhikkhu wishes to dwell perceiving non-repugnance in the repugnant, he could dwell perceiving non-repugnance. Here if a bhikkhu wishes to dwell perceiving repugnance in the non-repugnant, he could dwell perceiving repugnance.

            <span> It is said that there are nine connected with space. Again it is said that there are five in space. All men who attain to the fourth meditation, </span>
            <em>jh&#257;na</em>
            <span>, with facility, develop supernormal power. Again it is said that the fourth meditation, </span>
            <em>jh&#257;na</em>
            <span>, of the realm of form, makes for distinction. Therefore one, develops supernormal power. Again it is said that two of the four meditations, </span>
            <em>jh&#257;na</em>

            <span> &#8220;Will&#8221; is the wish to do. &#8220;Concentration&#8221; is non-distraction of the mind. That yogin wishes for supernormal power and the bases of supernormal power, and practises concentration and resolves upon the four kinds of endeavour. He endeavours to preclude the arising of evil demeritorious states that have not yet arisen; he endeavours to reject the evil demeritorious [[276|213]] states that have already arisen; he endeavours to cause the arising of meritorious states that have not yet arisen; he endeavours to increase and to consciously reproduce the meritorious states that have already arisen; and to develop them fully. These are called &#8220;the activities of endeavour&#8221;. &#8220;Endowed&#8221; means that one is endowed with these three qualities. Thus the six parts of the term are completed. &#8220;Basis of supernormal power&#8221;: That by which one attains to supernormal power&#8212;the &#8220;basis of supernormal power&#8221; is only that. Therefore that state is called &#8220;basis of supernormal power&#8221;. And again, the fulfilment of the activities of endeavour and the concentration of will&#8212;this is called the &#8220;basis of supernormal power&#8221;. It is the means of attending to supernormal power. This is the principal meaning. &#8220;Develops&#8221; means: &#8220;Practises and repeats it&#8221;. This is called &#8220;the development of the basis of supernormal power endowed with the activities of endeavour and the concentration of will&#8221;. Thus that yogin practises. This is the means of success:- Sometimes he falls back; sometimes he abides. He causes the arising of energy. He fulfils </span>
            <pb ed="PTS" n="442"/>
            <span> this basis of supernormal power which is endowed with concentration of energy and the activities of endeavour. (In) this means of success, he sometimes slackens, sometimes falls back, sometimes is perturbed. When the mind slackens, he produces the mental characteristic of alacrity; when the mind falls away, he produces concentration of mind; when the mind is perturbed, he produces the characteristic of equanimity. Thus his mind acquires the basis of supernormal power which is endowed with concentration of mind and the activities of endeavour. If one has a mind that is without defilement, one understands advantage and disadvantage with ease. He practises (saying): &#8220;Now is the time to develop&#8221;, or &#8220;now is not the time to develop&#8221;. Thus he accomplishes &#8220;the basis of supernormal power which is endowed with concentration of scrutiny and the activities of endeavour&#8221;. Thus that yogin develops the four bases of supernormal power. His mind, being wieldy, responds to the body, and his body responds to the mind. Thus that yogin sometimes controls the body with his mind, and sometimes the mind with his body. Depending on the body, the mind changes; depending on the mind, the body changes. Depending on the body, the mind resolves; depending on the mind, the body resolves. The perception of bliss and lightness adheres to the body. In that state he accomplishes and abides. Practising thus, that yogin reaches the acme of lightness, makes his body exceedingly pliant, and attains to the capacity-limit of resolve, even as a ball of iron made red-hot is capable of being fashioned into any shape easily. Thus having through mental </span>
            <span>culture made his body light, he, owing to the lightness of body, enters the fourth meditation, </span>
            <em>jh&#257;na</em>
            <span>, and is mindful and tranquil. Rising therefrom, he knows space, and resolves through knowledge. Thus his body is able to rise up in space, Having resolved through knowledge, </span>
            <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="277" n="214"/>
            <span> he can rise up in space. It is comparable to cottonwool blown by the wind.</span>

He can sink into the earth or come out of it, as if in water. He can walk on water as on dry land. He can move in space as a bird on the wing.

            <span>Now the yogin, wishing to acquire the supernormal power of transformation, practises the four bases of supernormal power. He gets control of the mind.

He resolves upon his mind with his body; and he resolves upon his body with his mind. The perception of bliss and the perception of lightness adhere to his body. In that he abides. Practising thus that yogin reaches the acme of lightness, making his body exceedingly pliant and reaches the capacity-limit of resolve, even as an iron ball made red-hot is capable of being fashioned into any shape easily. Thus having through mental culture made his mind pliant and capable of resolve, he resolves to fill his body with his mind.

            <span rend="bold">A.</span>
            <span> In the supernormal power of resolve, one resolves without discarding the form. In the supernormal power of transformation, one discards the form. This is the difference.</span>

            <span>Now the yogin wishes to acquire the supernormal power caused by the mind. Having got control of mind, he develops the bases of supernormal power and enters into the fourth meditation, </span>

            <span>. Rising therefrom peacefully, he attends to the interior of his body with the thought: &#8220;It is like an empty pot&#8221;. Further that yogin meditates thus: &#8220;Within this hollow body of mine I will cause changes as I like. I will cause it to change&#8221;. And in changing, he resolves through knowledge thus: &#8220;Following it I will accomplish!&#8221; Thus considering, he accomplishes the change. By this means, he makes many forms. Thereafter he engages himself in various activities. If the yogin wishes to go to the world of Brahm&#257; with a created body, he creates it in the form of a Brahm&#257; before entering the Brahm&#257; world. The form which is made according to his will is complete with all factors, and there is no faculty wanting in it. If </span>

            <span> the possessor of supernormal power walks to and fro, that created man also walks to and fro. If the possessor of supernormal power sits, or lies down, or sends forth vapour and flame, or asks questions, or answers, that created man also sits or lies down, sends forth vapour and flame, or asks questions, or answers. Because that made form springs from supernormal power, it does so.</span>

Hearing a sound afar off, or hearing a sound nearby, he attends to the sound sign. Hearing a gross sound or hearing a fine sound, he attends to the sound sign. Hearing a sound from the east, he attends to the sound sign. Thus as to all regions. Through the practice of the purity of mind and the purification of the ear element, that yogin strengthens the mental formations. That yogin hears what is beyond the reach of human ears owing to the purified divine hearing. He hears both sounds, namely, divine sounds and human sounds, also sounds afar and sounds near.</span>

            <span> Here the predecessors have said: &#8220;At first the new yogin hears the sound of beings within himself after that he hears the sound of beings outside his body. Thence he hears the sound of beings anywhere. Thus he strengthens attention gradually&#8221;. Again it is said: &#8220;At first the new yogin cannot hear the sound of beings within himself, because he is not able to hear fine sounds. He cannot reach the field of these (sounds) with the physical ear. But the new yogin could hear the sound of conchs, drums and the like, with the physical ear.&#8221; </span>

          <p>
            <span>Fine sounds or gross sounds, sounds afar off or sounds nearby could be heard with divine hearing. Here the new yogin should not attend to extremely fearful sounds, because he will (going to the other extreme) become attached to lovable sounds, and because he will stir up fear in his mind.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Knowledge of divine hearing proceeds in three objects, namely, limited object, present object and external object. If one loses physical hearing, one also loses divine hearing. Here, the hearer, who acquires facility (in the practice), is able to listen to the sounds of a thousand world-systems. The Silent Buddhas can hear more. There is no limit to the power of hearing of the Tath&#257;gata.</span>

            <span> which is pure and immovable. Rising from the fourth meditation, </span>
            <em>jh&#257;na</em>
            <span>, peacefully, he, at first, fills his body with light. He sees the colour of his own heart through divine sight. Through this colour he perceives his own states of consciousness, and knows through the changes in colour the changes in his own mind: &#8220;This colour proceeds from the faculty of joy; this colour proceeds from the faculty of fear; this colour proceeds from the faculty of equanimity&#8221;. If the consciousness which is accompanied by the faculty of joy arises, the heart is of the colour of curds and ghee. If the consciousness which is accompanied by the faculty of melancholy arises, it (the heart) is purple in colour. If the consciousness which is accompanied by the faculty of equanimity arises, it (the heart) is of the colour of honey. If the consciousness which is accompanied by lustful desire arises, it (the heart) is yellow in colour. If the consciousness which is accompanied by anger arises, it (the heart) is black in colour. If the consciousness which is accompanied by ignorance arises, it (the heart) is muddy in colour. If the consciousness which is accompanied by confidence and knowledge arises, it (the heart) is pure in colour. Thus that yogin understands the changes in colour through the changes within himself. At this time he diffuses other bodies with light and sees the colour of others&#8217; hearts through divine sight. He understands the changing </span>

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>&#8220;Many lives&#8221; means: recollection of past lives produced through four ways, viz., one develops the sign well, then one grasps the mental sign, one calms one&#8217;s faculties and one develops that ability. These four ways produce the recollection of past lives. Of these the recollection of seven past lives is the best. Through &#8220;birth made&#8221; means: deities, </span>
            <em>n&#257;gas</em>
            <span> (demons) and </span>
            <em>garulas</em>
            <span> (mythical birds) remember their past lives naturally. Of these the best remember fourteen past lives.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>&#8220;Practice made&#8221; means to produce by way of the four bases of supernormal power.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
            <span> How is the knowledge of the recollection of past lives developed?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span rend="bold">A.</span>
            <span> The new yogin, having practised the four bases of supernormal power, gains control of the mind through confidence, and becomes immovable and pure. He, having sat down, remembers what he had done in the day or all that he had done </span>
            <span>bodily, mentally and verbally. Thus also as regards the actions of the night. In the same way he recollects all that he had done during a day, during two days and thus backwards to one month. In the same way he remembers all that he had done during two months, one year, two years, three years, a hundred years up to his last birth. At this time the mind and the mental properties of the preceding birth and the mind and the mental properties of the succeeding birth appear. Owing to the mind and the mental properties of the preceding birth, he gets (the succeeding) birth. Owing to mind-succession, he is able to see the causes and conditions and remember the (backward) rolling of consciousness. The two (the preceding and the succeeding) are not disjoined and are produced in this world, having been produced in that world. Through such practice of the mind that is purified, that yogin remembers his varied lot in the past. Thus (he remembers) one life, two lives, three lives, four lives and so forth. The new yogin remembers all pertaining to this life. If any yogin is not able to remember his past births he should not give up exerting himself. He should develop meditation, </span>
            <em>jh&#257;na</em>
            <span>, again and again. He, in developing meditation, </span>
            <em>jh&#257;na</em>
            <span>, well, should purify the mind with action similar to the correct method of burnishing a mirror.</span>

Outsiders remember forty aeons. They cannot remember more than that, because of their feebleness. The noble hearers remember ten thousand aeons; more than this, the chief hearers; more than this, the Silent Buddhas; and more than this, the Tath&#257;gatas, the Supremely Enlightened Ones, who are able to recall to mind their own and others&#8217; previous lives, activities, spheres and all else.</span>

To that yogin who strengthens and increases his light, there is nothing obscure. There is nothing covered, and he surpasses the sun in splendour. Practising thus, that yogin diffuses his body with light and attends to colour and form.

            <span> Here, if one wishes to cause the arising of divine sight, he should suppress these defilements: uncertainty, wrong mindfulness, rigidity and torpor, pride, wrong joy, slanderous talk, excessive exercise of energy, too little exercise of energy, frivolous talk, perceptions of diversity, excessive </span>

            <span> investigation of forms. If any one of these defilements appears in the course of the practice of divine sight, concentration is lost. If concentration is lost, light is lost, vision of objects is lost. Therefore these defilements should be well suppressed. If he suppresses these defilements, but does not acquire facility in concentration, his power of divine sight is limited, owing to non-acquirement of facility. That yogin sees a limited splendour with limited divine sight. His vision of forms is also limited; therefore the Blessed One taught thus: &#8220;At a time when my concentration is limited, my eye is limited; and with a limited eye I know a limited splendour and I see limited forms. At a time when my concentration is immeasurable, my eye is possessed of immeasurable </span>
            <span>divine sight; and with an immeasurable divine sight, I know immeasurable splendour and I see immeasurable forms&#8221;.</span>

            <span>Here there are the following miscellaneous teachings: If one practises one kind of concentration with the purpose of seeing forms through divine sight, he can only see forms. He cannot hear sounds. If he practises one kind of concentration for the purpose of hearing sounds through divine hearing, he can hear sounds only. He cannot see forms. If he practises concentration for the purpose of seeing and hearing, he can see and hear. If he practises concentration for the purpose of seeing, hearing and knowing others&#8217; thoughts, he can see, hear and know others&#8217; thoughts. If he practises concentration for the purpose of seeing in one direction, he cannot see in another direction, he cannot hear and he cannot know others&#8217; thoughts. If he practises concentration much, he can see in all directions, he can hear and he can know Others&#8217; thoughts. Five supernormal powers are worldly higher knowledge. These are possessed by the denizens of the form plane who are with the cankers and commoners with the fetters. Meritorious higher knowledge belongs to both the learner and the commoner. To the Consummate One belongs non- characterizable higher knowledge. The five kinds of higher knowledge are not produced in the formless plane.</span>

There is wisdom which is due to aversion and also to penetration. There is wisdom which is due neither to aversion nor to penetration. Here the wisdom which is due to aversion and which is not due to penetration of supernormal knowledge and the knowledge of the Four Truths is called wisdom which is due to aversion and not due to penetration.

Buoyancy of matter means, the lightness-characteristic of material nature; impressibility of matter means, the plasticity-characteristic of material nature; adaptibility of matter means, the workability-characteristic of material nature; these three are the characteristics of non-sluggishness in material nature; the accumulation of these sense-organs is called the integration of matter. This integration of matter is called the continuity of matter. The arising of material objects is the coming to birth of matter; the maturing of material objects is the decay of matter; matter decays&#8212;this is called the impermanency of matter. That, by which beings get nutritive essence, is called solid food. The growth which is dependent on the primaries and the element of consciousness, is called the sense-organ of the material element. All primaries are characterized by the material quality of torpor. These twenty-six material qualities and the four primaries make up thirty kinds of matter.</span>

The arising of this is birth; its maturing is called decay; its destruction is called impermanency; what delimits it is called space-element; these four and the group arise together. When the eye-decad decays, it produces a second decad; these two kinds of decads should be known as &#8220;group&#8221;. Coming after is called succession. These six states arise together. When decay sets in, the second eye-decad produces a third decad. These, the second and the third eye-decads are called &#8220;group&#8221;. Coming after is called succession. The first decad is scattered, the second decad decays, the third decad arises. These occur in one moment. Thus the eye-decad arises. None can discern the interval. So quick it is that by worldly knowledge it cannot be known. There is a yogin. He sees the succession of the eye. It is like a flowing stream. It is like the flame of a lamp.</span>

Here nineteen material qualities are intrinsic. They are the twelve gross material qualities, femininity, masculinity, life-principle, element of water, solid food, material basis and material quality of eye, because they limit (?). Seven material qualities are material form. They are body-intimation, speech-intimation, buoyancy of matter, impressibility of matter, workability of matter, integration of matter, continuity of matter and intrinsic nature of matter, because they change. Three material qualities are material characteristics. They are birth of matter, decay of matter and impermanency of matter, because they are conditioned. One material quality is delimitation of matter. It is space-element, because it defines the groups. Here, through intrinsic nature one discriminates, not through the others. Thus one should understand through diversity.</span>

From the point of method, it is of seven kinds thus: feeling born of eye-contact, of ear-contact, of nose-contact, of tongue-contact, of body-contact, contact of mind-element, contact of mind- consciousness. Fully one hundred and eight kinds of feeling are fulfilled. Six states of feeling are aroused from craving; six from renunciation; six from grief-craving; six from grief-renunciation; six from equanimity-craving; six from equanimity-renunciation. Six times six are thirty-six, and in the three divisions of time, these thirty-six are increased three times. This is called the aggregate of feeling.</span>

              <span> Five kinds of consciousness are different as to sense-organ and as to object. Mind-element and mind consciouness-element are one as to sense-organ. Five-fold is the object of mind-element. Six-fold is the object of mind-consciousness-element. Five kinds of consciousness are as to state, internal; as to organ, internal; as to object, external. Mind-element is as to state, internal; as to organ, external; as to object, external. Mind-consciousness-element is as to state, internal; as to organ, external; as to object, internal and external. In respect of the six kinds of consciousness, organ and object proceed from the past. In respect of mind-consciousness-element, organ-production occurs at the moment of conception. There is no object of organ in the formless sphere because organ is produced first. Thus it should be understood through organ-object.</span>

              <span> Five kinds of consciousness are with initial and sustained application of thought. Mind-element is with initial and sustained application of thought. Mind-consciousness-element is with initial and sustained application of thought, or is without initial and only with sustained application of thought, or is neither with initial nor with sustained application of thought. Five kinds of consciousness act together with equanimity. Body-consciousness acts either together with pleasure or with pain. Mind-consciousness-element acts together with joy or grief or equanimity. Five kinds of consciousness are results. Mind-element is either result or means. Mind-consciousness-element is meritorious or demeritorious or result or means. Six kinds of consciousness do not arise without condition, are worldly states, with cankers, with fetters, with tangle, with flood, with yoke, with hindrance, infected, clinging, defiling, are not removed through seeing or through meditation. They are neither &#8220;group&#8221; nor &#8220;non-group&#8221;. They are neither training nor non-training. They are the subtle fetters of the sense-plane, are not fixed and are not vehicle. Mind consciousness-element has the nature of breaking up. Thus one should know to distinguish by way of states. This is called the aggregate of consciousness. Thus should the five aggregates be known.</span>

Through the visible object entering the field (of presentation?), the life-continuum vibrates, and is followed by adverting to the visible object. Adverting which depends on the eye is followed by discerning. This is followed by reception in the sense of experience. Then follows examining in the sense of (investigating) experience. After that comes determining in the sense of understanding. Determining proceeds and is followed by apperception according to action. Apperception proceeding in the sense of full cognition and not in the sense of means, is followed by registration of effect. After that consciousness lapses into the life-continuum.</span>

              <span> The king sleeps in his chamber, having closed the door. A slave-girl massages the king&#8217;s feet. The queen sits near him. Ministers and courtiers are ranged in front of him. A deaf man is guarding the door with his back against it. At that time the king&#8217;s gardener, bringing mangoes, knocks at the door. Hearing that sound, the king awakes, and says to the slave-girl, &#8220;Go and open the door&#8221;. The slave goes to the door-keeper and speaks to him in gesture. That deaf door-keeper understands her wish and opens the door and sees the mangoes. The king takes his sword. The slave brings the fruits and hands them to a minister. The minister presents them to the queen. The queen washes them and sorts the ripe from the raw, places them in a vessel and gives them to the king. Getting them, the king eats the fruits. After eating them, he talks of the merit or non-merit of them. After that he sleeps again.</span>

              <span>The sleeping king is the life-continuum. The king&#8217;s gardener, bringing mangoes and knocking at the door, is the impact of the visible object on the eye-door. The awakening of the king by the knocking at the door, and his command to open the door, illustrate the vibration of the life-continuum. The slave-girl&#8217;s gestures, in requesting the door-keeper to open the door, is adverting. The opening of the door by the deaf door-keeper and the sight of the mangoes illustrate eye-consciousness. The taking of the sword by the king and the handing of the fruits by the slave to the minister illustrate reception. The presentation of the fruits by the minister to the queen is examining. The </span>

His talking as to the merits or demerits of the fruits illustrate registration of effect, and his sleeping again is the lapsing into the life-continuum.</span>

Through the impact of objects of lower intensity, consciousness lapses into the life-continuum immediately after determining. In the same way the procedure at the other doors should be understood. At the mind-door there is no impact of object. Conditioned by attention, and free from activities is the object grasped at the mind-door. Here, with reference to a very great object three stages are produced (after vibration) of the life-continuum, namely, adverting, apperception and registration. With reference to the objects of great and slight intensity two stages are fulfilled: adverting and apperception.</span>

              <span>It is like seeds placed in a fertile field. If consciousness is extinguished, becoming is extinguished. This is the meaning of conditioned by ignorance the formations arise. Mental formations, conditioned by ignorance, enter the course of becoming, and integrate. Becoming proceeds; thus it is continued. Consciousness does not separate from mind in becoming. Therefore, conditioned by the formations, consciousness arises.</span>

The other does not depend on these. Therefore, conditioned by name-form, the six-sphered-sense arises. By the union of the other faculties, objects, elements and consciousness, contact arises. Therefore, conditioned by the six-sphered-sense, contact arises. Through the sense of touch one experiences pain, pleasure and neither pain nor pleasure. Should one not be touched (then there would be no feeling for him). Therefore, conditioned by contact, feeling arises. The uninstructed commoner experiences pleasure and clings to it and craving for more, he experiences pain; and overcoming it (pain), he, desiring ease, develops the feeling of neither pain nor pleasure, or equanimity.</span>

The bare enjoyment of that time is delusion of mind. This is called ignorance. Through attachment to this ignorance, one conditions the formations. Through attachment to these formations, one conditions consciousness, and knows the associated states of mind and the material object produced by the formations. Conditioned by this consciousness, name-form arises. From feeling joy is produced. Conditioned by joy and conditioned by the joy- producing material object, the bare faculties arise. Thus conditioned by name-form the six-sphered-sense arises. Conditioned by pleasurable contact, feeling arises. Conditioned by the craving for feeling, craving arises. Through attachment to bare pleasure and conditioned by craving, clinging arises. Through attachment to and conditioned by clinging, there is becoming. Conditioned by becoming, birth arises, and when living (begins) to end&#8212;this is decay. To scatter and to destroy&#8212;this is death.

              <span>Here, the defilements are a cause of future life, like the colours of a painter. Their objects are not self-produced, as also are the colour-object of the painter. Defilements cause becoming like the different colours of the painter. These two are past, namely, ignorance and the formations. These two are of the future, namely, birth and decay-and-death. The other eight are of the present. Thus it is as to the three divisions of time. Therefore one should know that birth and death proceed from beginningless time. The factors of the twelvefold conditioned arising should not be taught (separately). Further, no conditioned arising should be taught which does not consist of these twelve. Then, what is conditioned arising? Just these twelve which in turn </span>
              <span>become condition. Therefore this is called conditioned arising. The twelve factors are states which have already developed. What is the difference between the two?

The action-sign resembles action already done. Destiny: A happy destiny arises through the conditioning of merit. An evil destiny arises through the conditioning of demerit.

The appropriate grasping-sign arises, and the man, leaning or sitting or lying (on his death-couch), grasps that. After the consciousness which apperceives the past action or the action-sign or the destiny or the destiny-sign ends, the last consciousness arises without a break gradually through apperceptional consciousness. Only that action or action-sign or destiny or destiny-sign becomes the object of the basic resultant consciousness. Like the lighting of a lamp by a lamp,</span>

              <span>How, through wheel? Ignorance conditions the formations; the formations condition consciousness; thus birth conditions decay and death. Thus the whole aggregate of ill arises. Therefore all constitute the aggregate of ill. Not knowing is called ignorance. Ignorance conditions the formations. Thus should it be known by way of the wheel.</span>

              <span> It is that which begins from ignorance. What is meant by &#8220;seed is cause&#8221;? It is likened to the succession of seed and bud. What is meant by &#8220;doing is cause&#8221;? It is likened to the change of material qualities. What is meant by &#8220;common action is cause&#8221;? It is likened to earth, snow, mountain, sea sun and moon.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>There is another teaching. Common action is not a cause. Material qualities, consciousness, states and caloricity are causes. There is no common action, according to the teaching of the Blessed One thus:</span>

Birth and decay and death are comprehended in the aggregate of form and in the aggregate of the formations. Ignorance, the formations, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, becoming, rebirth and decay and death are comprehended in the sense-sphere of ideas. Consciousness is comprehended in the mind-sphere. Name-form is comprehended in the five internal sense-spheres. The six-sphered-sense is comprehended in the six internal sense-spheres. Ignorance, the formations, contact, feeling, craving, clinging, becoming, rebirth and decay and death are comprehended in the element of ideas. Consciousness is comprehended in the mind-consciousness-element. Name-form is comprehended in the five elements. The six-sphered-sense is comprehended in the twelvefold truth. Ignorance, craving and clinging are comprehended in the tenfold truth. The other nine, are comprehended in the Truth of Ill. Supramundane conditioned arising way-factor is comprehended in the Path-truth. The extinction of conditioned arising is comprehended in the Truth of Cessation. Thus one should know through comprehension. Through these ways should one understand the method of conditioned arising. This is called conditioned arising method.</span>

              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> The Noble Truths are the teaching of the Holy One. Therefore they are called Noble Truths. Through understanding these well, one fulfils the Four Noble Truths. &#8220;Truth&#8221; means: &#8220;Thus-isness, non-variability, identity&#8221;. Ill is the consequence. Origin is the cause. Cessation is ending continued. The Path is the highest view. Thus should these be known through the meaning of words.</span>

              <span> Ill is the characteristic of suffering. </span>
              <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="338" n="275"/>
              <span> Origin is the characteristic of cause. Cessation is the characteristic of non-birth. The Path is the characteristic of the means of success. And again, ill is the characteristic of grief, despair, the put together, the limited. Origin is the characteristic of accumulation, cause, condition, fetters, clinging. Cessation is the characteristic of renunciation, solitude, the non-conditioned and the choice. The Path is the characteristic of vehicle, arriving, seeing, reliance. Thus should these be known through characteristics.</span>

              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> The Truth of Ill is taught first, because it is gross and because it could be easily understood in this world. The Truth of Origin is taught next. The ending of the origin is the ending of ill. After that the Truth of Cessation is taught for the purpose of ending completely. And the Path is taught last. This </span>
              <span>(method) is like (that of) a clever physician, who at first gets at the root of the disease and later inquires as to the contributory causes. For the ending of the disease, he prescribes according to the nature of the disease. Here, one should know the disease as ill; the cause and condition as origin; the ending of the disease as cessation; and the medicine as the Path. Thus should these be known through series.</span>

              <span> There are four kinds in truth: Speech that is true, knowledge, absolute truth and Ariyan Truth. Here, a man speaks true words and not words that are untrue &#8212; this is called speech that is true. Investigation of falsehood &#8212; this is knowledge. </span>
              <em>Nibb&#257;na</em>
              <span> is absolute truth. The truth practised by the Saint is Ariyan Truth. Here, Ariyan Truth should be realized. Thus should these be known through discrimination. </span>

Because of the characteristics of despair, misery, the put together , and the limited, there is the Truth of Ill. Because of the characteristics of accumulation, cause and condition, clinging and combination, the Truth of Origin is fulfilled. Thus should these be understood through enumeration.</span>

He does not let it run hither and thither, and recalls to mind the Four Noble Truths. First he should recall to mind the Truth of Ill through aggregation, sense-sphere and element. The idea of aggregation should be recalled to mind through one&#8217;s own characteristics and through the characteristics of the aggregates, in the way it was taught, under the method of understanding the aggregates. The (idea of) sense-sphere should be recalled to mind through the characteristic of sense-sphere, in the way it was taught, under the method of understanding the sense-spheres. The (idea of) element should be recalled to mind through the characteristics of element, in the way it was taught, under the method of understanding the elements. Thus having understood aggregate, sense-sphere and element, that yogin knows that there are only aggregates, sense-spheres and elements, and that there is no being or soul. Thus he gains the perception of the formations</span>

              <span> Characteristics of form: One grasps the form-consciousness by way of the earth-element, water-element, fire-element, air-element, sense-sphere </span>
              <span>of eye or sense-sphere of body. Characteristic of feeling: One grasps feeling by way of the pleasurable, the painful or the neither pleasurable nor painful. Characteristics of perception: One grasps perception by way of form-perception of perception of states. Characteristics of the formations: One grasps the formations through contact, volition, initial application of thought, sustained application of thought, or deliberation. Characteristics of consciousness: One grasps consciousness through eye-consciousness or mind-consciousness. One grasps one&#8217;s particular meditation and produces the sign skilfully. Thus one grasps the characteristics of form, feeling, perception, the formations and consciousness. </span>

              <span> Thought arises owing to object. One should grasp that, &#8220;Through this form-object, feeling-object, perception-object, formation-object, and consciousness-object, thought arises&#8221;, &#8212;thus one grasps. This is the grasping of the characteristics of thought through the object. </span>
              <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
              <span> How does one grasp the characteristics of thought through taking to heart? </span>

              <span> &#8220;Through taking to heart, thought arises&#8221;,&#8212;thus one should consider. &#8220;Through taking feeling, perception and the formations to heart, thought arises&#8221;,&#8212;thus should one introspect. Thus through the taking to heart one grasps the characteristics of thought.</span>

              <span>Thus that yogin enjoys dwelling upon the characteristics of arising and passing away, discerns the formations as subject to breaking up arid develops concentration. Effortlessly he produces intellection and sees the breaking up of mind-states. Through the form-object and through the arising and passing away of the mind, he sees the rise and fall of the mind-states associated with that object. In the same way </span>
              <span>he sees the rise and fall of the mind-states which are associated with these objects, through the perception-object, the formationobject, the consciousness-object and through the rise and fall of mind.</span>

                <span> Through assemblage, he sees the falling away of the postures in their several spheres and the associated mind and the mental properties with them. And again, he grasps form-impermanence, feeling-impermanence, perception-impermanence, formation-impermanence and consciousness-impermanence. After that he sees the breaking up of the mind and the mental properties which are associated with the object of impermanence, by way of assemblage. In the same way, with the object of ill and the object of not-self.</span>

Thus he sees again and again the breaking up of mind-states. Thus through understanding he sees the breaking up of many states. Likewise, he discerns ill and not-self. Thus having understood, he grasps breaking up. That object of ill and breaking up makes for intentness, intent on the formations always, he attains to well-being every moment.

              <span> That yogin arouses rapture for the doctrine. That rapture pacifies his mind; and sitting again, he calms the mind and makes it conform to the doctrine. If his mind conforms to the doctrine, he rejects the idea of permanence through concentration of the reviewing of breaking up. Being free from the idea of permanence, he becomes familiar with the method and removes (distraction of mind).</span>

              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> That yogin causes the arising of illumination in the doctrine at first, believes that he has attained to the supramundane state, thinks that he has attained what he has not attained and does not endeavour further. Thus he arouses conceit. The intelligent yogin knows that defilement disturbs meditation, arid knows that worldly states have the formations for object, Thus he knows that the supramundane state has </span>
              <em>Nibb&#257;na</em>
              <span> for object. Having seen thus, he removes distraction and conceit by this knowledge and seeing only breaking up, practises well and practises repeatedly.</span>

Thus if that yogin fears the cause of the aggregates, the coming to be of the aggregates, the three planes of becoming, the five kinds of ill-faring, the seven abodes of consciousness and the nine abodes of sentience, the knowledge of the desire for release arises.</span>

              <span>By means of the knowledge of adoption, he knows ill, immediately after. He cuts off origin, and makes cessation manifest. He practises the Path, and attains to the Path-knowledge of Stream-entrance and all accessories of enlightenment. At this time the yogin sees the limited, the unconditioned, and the sublime, through seclusion. He understands the Four Noble Truths in one moment, in one comprehension, not before or after (each other).</span>

            <p>
              <span>He understands at once ill, the cutting off of origin, the realization of cessation and the practice of the Path. Thus he understands. It is taught in the simile in verse thus:</span>

The man leaves this bank, cuts the stream, carries the goods and reaches the further bank.

              <span> Of the knowledge that understands ill, of the removal of origin, of the realization of cessation and of the practising of the Path, what are the signs? </span>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> If the yogin does not understand ill, the four reversals occur. And at that time the yogin sees the limited, the unconditioned and the element of the sublime through solitude. Through the knowledge that occurs in one moment, he realizes the Four Truths at the same time, neither before nor after. </span>
              <span rend="bold">Q.</span>
              <span> How should these be understood. </span>
              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> By means of the knowledge of arising and falling away, he cannot comprehend the flood of ill and the tribulation of the formations as they truly are; He practises on a sign which does not belong to the formations. And he passes over to that which is not formation. Thus he sees the tribulation of the formations as they are through causing the mind to practise on a sign belonging to the formations, and passes over to that which is not formations. Here he comprehends the flood of ill and reaches the end. And again, it is said that if that is so, he should be able to discern the Truth through, the solitude and the knowledge of adoption. The knowledge of adoption arises from the formations, and passes over that which is non-formation. When the knowledge of adoption which arises from the sign of the formations passes over to that which is non-formation, he can attain to </span>
              <em>Nibb&#257;na</em>
              <span>. Intentness on the cause is its only object. Through intentness on the object, he can develop concentration of mind. When he gets concentration, [[367|304]] he produces serenity and insight, and also can fulfil the enlightenment accessories. Thereby he understands the Truth through the knowledge of adoption. From that knowledge of adoption the knowledge of the Path is produced immediately. At that time he can get the concentration of </span>

            <p>
              <span>It is like a man stepping across the threshold of the gate of a burning city. When he has placed one foot outside the city, he is not yet entirely outside the city. Thus at that time, the knowledge of adoption arises from that object of the formations and passes over to that which is non-formation. But here it cannot be said that he has done with the defilements, because many states are yet not perfected. Just as when a man places both his feet outside the threshold of the gate of the burning city, it can be said that he is out of the burning city, just so when the knowledge of adoption arouses the knowledge of the Path without end, it could be said that one has gone out of the walled city of the defilements, because the states are complete. Therefore, through the knowledge of adoption, one fulfils the discernment of Truth.</span>

              <span> Attention to impermanence destroys the formations, and emancipates the mind in many ways. Thus faith and the other four faculties are got. And the knowledge of the thus-isness of the sign makes manifest the impermanence of all compounded things, arouses fear of the sign of the formations and, through proceeding in the signless, surpasses the sign through the emancipation that is without sigh: and the release from the aggregates takes place. Thus the signless emancipation is fulfilled through impermanence-penetration.</span>

              <span>things, arouses fear towards birth, gains the knowledge of birth and, proceeding in the birthless, surpasses birth through the emancipation that is without hankering; and the release from the aggregates takes place. Thus the unhankered emancipation is fulfilled through ill-penetration.</span>

              <span> Attention to Not-self makes manifest the voidness of the formations and stirs up aversion for them.. Thus wisdom and the four other faculties are got.

              <span rend="bold">A.</span>
              <span> With the signless emancipation, three emancipations are gained. Owing to the signless, there is emancipation of the mind. Although emancipation is gained, there is hankering left, yet; therefore unhankered emancipation is won. Thus the three emancipations are fulfilled. Through attention (to impermanence etc.) emancipation of the mind is gained. Through emancipation from the sign and attachment, void emancipation is won and the three emancipations are fulfilled; because if emancipation from attachment is fulfilled, it also is emancipation due to attention to the sign. Thus after attaining to the three emancipations the one Path is fulfilled.</span>

              <span> The Consummate One and the Non-returner enter upon this attainment Who do not enter upon it? The commoner, the Stream-entrant, the Once-returner and he who is born in the formless element. Here, the commoner cannot enter upon it, because he is not of that plane. The Stream-entrant and the Once-returner cannot, because they have not yet cut off the bondage of the defilements. He who enters the formless element cannot, because it is not its plane.</span>

              <span> One attains to concentration through the tranquillizing of three activities. They are verbal formations, bodily formations and thought formations. Here, entering into the second meditation, </span>

              <span>, one tranquillizes the bodily formations of inhalation and exhalation. Entering into the concentration of the dissolution of perception and sensation, one removes the thought-formations of perception and sensation.</span>

              <span> There are four preliminary duties: Non-destruction of others&#8217; property, discerning the time, non-disturbance, honouring the Community of Bhikkhus. He resolves as regards bowl, robe and other requisites. He resolves as regards non-disturbance of this body in every way. He reflects on the strength of his body and resolves after discerning the time. Here, he should consider the remote past. Discerning that it is not the time for the meeting of the Community of Bhikkhus, he sits and resolves: &#8220;I shall emerge, when I am called&#8221;. And here the non-destruction of others&#8217; property is for the sake of protecting the robes (of others). The second and third are for the sake of protecting the body. </span>

            <p>
              <span>The fourth is for the sake of not obstructing the meeting of the Community of Bhikkhus. Thus attaining to the sphere of nothingness and emerging therefrom, he performs the preliminary duties and enters the first meditation, </span>

              <span>&#8220;How is it entered upon?&#8221;: That yogin enters into a solitary dwelling, and sitting down, or lying down, enjoys the consciousness of dissolution. He enters the first meditation, </span>
              <em>jh&#257;na</em>
              <span>, and merging from it peacefully, sees the impermanence, ill and not-self of that meditation, </span>

              <span>, the sphere of the infinity of space, the sphere of the infinity of consciousness and the sphere of nothingness. Then emerging therefrom peacefully, he sees the impermanence, ill and not-self of Right Concentration immediately, and being possessed of the knowledge of equanimity towards the formations, he enters into the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception immediately. Then passing beyond two or three turns of consciousness, he causes the perishing of mind and enters into the Unborn and the Unmanifest. This is called the entry into the attainment of the dissolution of perception and sensation.</span>

              <span>&#8220;What is the difference between a dead man and a man who enters into the attainment of the dissolution of perception and sensation?&#8221;: In the dead man, not only are three formations stilled, but vitality is cut off, heat is cut off, the faculties are </span>
              <span>cut off. In the man who has entered the attainment of the dissolution of perception and sensation, although the (three) formations are stilled, vitality, heat and the faculties are not cut off. This is the difference.</span>

          <span>The order and method of development of the Path is shown in the </span>
          <em>Ratha- vin&#299;ta Sutta</em>
          <span> of the </span>
          <em>Majjhima Nik&#257;ya</em>
          <span>. There are seven purifications taught there. They are: purification of virtue, purification of mind, purification of view, purification of transcending doubt, purification of knowledge and vision of what is and is not the Path, purification of knowledge and vision of practice, purification of knowledge and vision.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>These seven have to be developed one by one, in the order given in the </span>
          <em>sutta</em>
          <span> mentioned above, because of the dependence of concentration on virtue, and of wisdom on concentration. The purifications have been set forth with an illustration of seven carriages arranged for Pasenadi, the king of Kosala, from S&#257;vatthi to S&#257;keta. No carriage takes the king beyond the one next to it on the road to S&#257;keta, and the last carries him to his destination. The carriages arranged for the yogi going to </span>
          <em>Nibb&#257;na</em>
          <span> are the seven purifications. No purification takes the yogi beyond the one next to it on the road to </span>
          <em>Nibb&#257;na</em>
          <span>, and it is by the last that he reaches his bourne.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Virtue is fulfilled by the first purification, concentration, by the second, and wisdom that precedes the Supramundane Path by the next four purifications. The last purification is attained in the Supramundane Path-moment when all the factors of the Noble Path occur together. The purifications </span>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="417" n="354"/>
          <span> cannot function out of place. Each of the purifications has to work in its proper place, and do what it should to aid the others in fulfilling the yogi&#8217;s aim. None of these can be ignored as they are all vital parts of single system.</span>

          <span>The gradualness of the Path of the Buddha is also taught in the following passage: &#8216;The attainment of knowledge at once, bhikkhus, I do not make known; still the attainment of knowledge occurs by gradual training, gradual work, and gradual practice. How bhikkhus, does the attainment of knowledge occur, by gradual training, work, and practice? Here, a man imbued with faith draws near; drawing near, he sits down near by; sitting down near by, he pays attention; paying attention, he hears the doctrine; having heard the doctrine, he remembers it; of what he remembers, he examines the meaning; while he examines the meaning, the teachings become intelligible to him; when to him the teachings become intelligible, ardour is born in him; when he is with ardour, he becomes energetic; having become energetic, he investigates the nature, of things; having investigated the nature of things, he strives to reach the Path; while striving to reach the Path, he realises truly by his mental body the highest truth and sees it, having penetrated it with wisdom&#8217;.</span>

          <span>Control of the sense-faculties, abandoning of thoughts of sense-desires, bringing into being the factors of enlightenment, and protecting the sign of </span>
          <pb ed="BPS1995" pdf_page="419" n="356"/>
          <span> concentration, are aspects of right effort to which the yogi has to pay attention. The practice of contemplation however, is born with the effort to control the sense-faculties. It may be rightly said that the long journey to peace and immunity from mental ill through the Path does not really begin until the restraint of sense-faculties, which stops the arising of thoughts useless for release from ill, become habitual to the yogi. When control of the sense-faculties becomes strong and a habit, it makes for the maturing of the qualities necessary for intuition of highest freedom. The value of constant practice of restraint of the sense-faculties is brought out in the story given below of the Elder Mah&#257;tissa who dwelt on Cetiya Hill (Mihintale).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>The Elder was once going for alms to Anur&#257;dhapura. A woman who had quarrelled with her husband having thought, &#8216;Remaining alone in the house is better than this unpleasant marriage5, got on to the road early in the morning, fully trimmed up and decked out like a divine nymph, to go towards Mihintale. And she who was going to the house of her relatives saw on the way the worshipful Elder of calm demeanour and broke out into wanton laughter with low intent of making him look at her. The Elder, who was walking with attention on his basic contemplation subject, wondering &#8216;What is it?&#8217; looked up. And because of his seeing the row of bones of her teeth, his own contemplation subject of bones became clear to his mind. Developing insight then and there, he attained the Fruit of Arahatship. So it is said:</span>
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>
            <span>Having beheld the bones that were her teeth,</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>And called back to mind his first perception,</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>The elder, who was standing in that place,</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>Indeed, arrived at the consummate state.</span>
          </l>
        </lg>
        <p>
          <span>The husband, who was going in search of her, saw the Elder and asked him, &#8216;Venerable sir, did you see a woman going?&#8217;. The Elder replied:</span>
        </p>
        <lg>
          <l>
            <span>I know not whether what passed</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>Through this place was a man or woman,</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>But I know that on this highway</span>
          </l>
          <l>
            <span>There is going a frame of bones.</span>

          <span> the ripening of his wisdom. For bringing about that state of wisdom the yogi has to give attention to the practice of mindfulness and full awareness. Mindfulness is required in all effective contemplation. Through full awareness one learns to do everything with deliberation and not on the spur of the moment. Mindfulness belongs to the aggregate of concentration of the Noble Path ; it has to be highly developed before success in </span>

          <span>, meditation, that is aloof from sense-desires, and other evil states of mind, can be achieved. When contemplatives are weak in remembering what should be remembered at the proper time their mindfulness is ineffective and full awareness of what is fit to be done, is not present. Then they also lack wise consideration, which is necessary for overcoming adventitious defilements, and are assailed by passion.</span>

It is said that this Elder was overcome by passion for an object of the opposite sex, while he was collecting alms in a village, but by means of immediate reflection on the danger of such a mental state, he abandoned the defilement by suppression, and returned to his monastery. The object, however, came up to him in a dream. Seeing danger in it, he was strongly moved to rid himself of the disturbing thought. He visited a teacher of contemplation. Having got from him a contemplation subject connected with the foulness of the body and opposed to lust, he practised contemplation in a jungle, and attained the third Path of Sanctitude after destroying lust.</span>

          <span> said that the teaching of the discourses on the foundations of mindfulness, the </span>
          <em>Satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na Suttas</em>
          <span>, is a combination of serenity and insight and that it lays stress on insight. But the practice of serenity in these </span>
          <em>suttas</em>
          <span> on mindfulness is not something that can be ignored. The </span>
          <em>Satipa&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na Suttas</em>
          <span> do not permit of restriction only to the development of insight. In short the practice of serenity (</span>

          <span>) in these </span>
          <em>suttas</em>
          <span> is not optional. It is necessary for the cultivator of mindfulness to bring into being both serenity and insight, because the first leads to the second, and the practice of the first, that is, serenity is unavoidable for the beginner in the practice of the Foundations of Mindfulness, according to the pattern of the standard </span>
          <em>suttas</em>
          <span> on the subject. The insight taught in these </span>
          <em>suttas</em>
          <span> can be developed only by those who have the purity of virtue (</span>
          <em>s&#299;lavisuddhi</em>
          <span>) and the purity of mind (</span>
          <em>cittavisuddhi</em>
          <span>), which is always taught in the books as the product of serenity, mental purity, which must be in existence before one begins to purify one&#8217;s views.</span>

          <span>No progress in contemplation leading towards the Supramundane Path is possible without at least getting the First </span>
          <em>Jh&#257;na</em>
          <span>. The practice of insight is unfruitful, ineffective, and obstructed when it is attempted without going away from thought-proximity to the sensual plane, </span>
          <em>k&#257;mabh&#363;mi</em>
          <span>. In one who has attained the First </span>
          <em>Jh&#257;na</em>
          <span> a proper environment is created internally for the intuition of the highest as well as for progress in the antecedent part of the Path that is connected with insight-development.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Of the First </span>
          <em>Jh&#257;na</em>
          <span>, from the time of coming to which a yogi undergoes the first great transformation of consciousness, it is said that it is the escape from sensuality. That escape is due to the factor of unification in the </span>
          <em>jh&#257;na</em>
          <span> brought about by concentration on what is not connected with sense-desire. With the escape into the consciousness of the First </span>
          <em>Jh&#257;na</em>
          <span> the sensuous realm is not in being for the yogi, since attainment of this </span>
          <em>jh&#257;na</em>
          <span> is only possible with abandoning the sensuous realm. As the light of a lamp is not in being when there is full darkness, so </span>
          <em>jh&#257;na</em>
          <span> is not in being when sense-desires, which are contrary to it, are present. As by leaving the hither bank the reaching of the thither bank takes place, so by giving up sense-desires the First </span>
          <em>Jh&#257;na</em>
          <span> is reached. The First </span>
          <em>Jh&#257;na,</em>
          <span> owing to its transcension of the element of the sensuous (</span>
          <em>k&#257;madh&#257;tu samatikkapnanato</em>
          <span>) and its being opposed to sensuous lust (</span>
          <em>k&#257;m&#257;r&#257;ga pa&#7789;ipakkhabh&#257;vato</em>
          <span>), is truly free from sense-desires. In the sense of escape from sense-desires this </span>
          <em>jh&#257;na</em>
          <span> is renunciation according to the Venerable S&#257;riputta Thera&#8217;s words. This is the escape from sense-desires, namely, renunciation.</span>

          <span> of the </span>
          <em>Majjhima Nik&#257;ya</em>
          <span>, the Blessed one says that it is not possible for one who is given to a life of pleasure, who indulges himself in sensual delights, who is devoured by sensual thoughts, who is consumed with the fever of sensual enjoyment, and who is eager in the pursuit of the sensually pleasant, to experience, see, or realise, what has to be experienced, seen, and realised by renunciation of sense-desires.</span>

          <span> Now sense-desires and the other hindrances to the First </span>
          <em>Jh&#257;na</em>
          <span> are not conducive to the penetration of things and seeing them as they are. So, for the development of insight (</span>
