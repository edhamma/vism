Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa’s </span><em>Visuddhimagga</em><span> is a classic text of the latter type. It represents the epitome of Pali Buddhist literature, weaving together its many strands to create this wonderful meditation manual, which even today retains the clarity it revealed when it was written.</span></p><p><span>There are occasions when people like to make much of the supposed differences in the various traditions of Buddhism that have evolved in different times and places. What I find especially encouraging about a book such as this is that it shows so clearly how much all schools of Buddhism have fundamentally in common. Within a structure based on the traditional three trainings of ethical discipline, concentration and wisdom are detailed instructions on how to take an ethical approach to life, how to meditate and calm the mind, and on the basis of those how to develop a correct understanding of reality. We find practical advice about creating an appropriate environment for meditation, the importance of developing love and compassion, and discussion of dependent origination that underlies the Buddhist view of reality. The very title of the work, the </span><em>Path of Purification,</em><span> refers to the essential Buddhist understanding of the basic nature of the mind as clear and aware, unobstructed by disturbing emotions. This quality is possessed by all sentient beings which all may realize if we pursue such a path.</span></p><p><span>Sometimes I am asked whether Buddhism is suitable for Westerners or not. I believe that the essence of all religions deals with basic human problems and Buddhism is no exception. As long as we continue to experience the basic human sufferings of birth, disease, old age, and death, there is no question of whether it is suitable or not as a remedy. Inner peace is the key. In that state of mind you can face difficulties with calm and reason. The teachings of love, kindness and tolerance, the conduct of non-violence, and especially the Buddhist theory that all things are relative can be a source of that inner peace.</span></p><p><span>While the essence of Buddhism does not change, superficial cultural aspects will change. But how they will change in a particular place, we cannot say. This evolves over time. When Buddhism first came from India to countries like Sri Lanka or Tibet, it gradually evolved, and in time a unique tradition arose. This is also happening in the West, and gradually Buddhism may evolve with Western culture.</span></p><p><span>Of course, what distinguishes the contemporary situation from past transmissions of Buddhism is that almost the entire array of traditions that evolved elsewhere is now accessible to anyone who is interested. And it is in such a context that I welcome this new edition of Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli’s celebrated English translation of the </span><em>Path of Purification</em><span>. I offer my prayers that readers, wherever they are, may find in it advice and inspiration to develop that inner peace that will contribute to creating a happier and more peaceful world.</span></p><p><span>May 2000</span></p></section><section class="sect-dp3"><h1><span>Publisher’s Foreword to Third Edition </span></h1><p><span class="vism-page-bps">[26|xxiv]</span><span>Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli’s translation of the </span><em>Visuddhimagga</em><span> not only makes available in fluent English this difficult and intricate classical work of Theravāda Buddhism, the high point of the commentarial era, but itself ranks as an outstanding cultural achievement perhaps unmatched by Pali Buddhist scholarship in the twentieth century. This achievement is even more remarkable in that the translator had completed the first draft within his first four years as a bhikkhu, which is also the amount of time he had been a student of Pali.</span></p><p><span>The Buddhist Publication Society first issued this work beginning in 1975, with the kind consent of the original publisher, Mr. Ānanda Semage of Colombo. This was a reprint produced by photolithographic process from the 1964 edition. The 1979 reprint was also a photolithographic reprint, with some minor corrections..</span></p><p><span>For this edition the text has been entirely recomposed, this time with the aid of the astonishing electronic typesetting equipment that has proliferated during the past few years.

So it was not done with any intention at all of publication; but rather it grew together out of notes made on some of the book’s passages. By the end of 1953 it had been completed, more or less, and put aside. Early in the following year a suggestion to publish it was put to me, and I eventually agreed, though not without a good deal of hesitation. Reasons for agreeing, however, seemed not entirely lacking. The only previous English version of this remarkable work had long been out of print. Justification too could in some degree be founded on the rather different angle from which this version is made.</span></p><p><span>Over a year was then spent in typing out the manuscript during which time, and since, a good deal of revision has taken place, the intention of the revision being always to propitiate the demon of inaccuracy and at the same time to make the translation perspicuous and the translator inconspicuous. Had publication been delayed, it might well have been more polished. Nevertheless the work of polishing is probably endless. Somewhere a halt must be made.</span></p><p><span>A guiding principle—the foremost, in fact—has throughout been avoidance of misrepresentation or distortion; for the ideal translation (which has yet to be made) should, like a looking glass, not discolour or blur or warp the original which it reflects. Literalness, however, on the one hand and considerations of clarity and style on the other make irreconcilable claims on a translator, who has to choose and to compromise. Vindication of his choice is sometimes difficult.</span></p><p><span>I have dealt at the end of the Introduction with some particular problems. Not, however, with all of them or completely; for the space allotted to an introduction is limited.</span></p><p><span>Much that is circumstantial has now changed since the Buddha discovered and made known his liberating doctrine 2,500 years ago, and likewise since this work was composed some nine centuries later. On the other hand, the Truth he discovered has remained untouched by all that circumstantial change. Old cosmologies give place to new; but the questions of consciousness, of pain and death, of responsibility for acts, and of what should be looked to in the scale it values as the highest of all, remain. Reasons for the perennial freshness of the Buddha’s teaching—of his handling of these questions—are several, but not least among them is its independence of any particular cosmology. Established as it is for its foundation on the self-evident insecurity of the human situation (the truth of suffering), the structure of the Four Noble Truths provides an unfailing standard of value, unique in its simplicity, its completeness and its ethical purity, by means of which any situation can be assessed and a profitable choice made.</span></p><p><span>Now I should like to make acknowledgements, as follows, to all those without whose help this translation would never have been begun, persisted with or completed. </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[28|xxvi]</span><span>To the venerable Ñāṇatiloka Mahāthera (from whom I first learned Pali) for his most kind consent to check the draft manuscript. However, although he had actually read through the first two chapters, a long spell of illness unfortunately prevented him from continuing with this himself.</span></p><p><span>To the venerable Soma Thera for his unfailing assistance both in helping me to gain familiarity with the often difficult Pali idiom of the Commentaries and to get something of the feel—as it were, “from inside”—of Pali literature against its Indian background. Failing that, no translation would ever have been made: I cannot tell how far I have been able to express any of it in the rendering.</span></p><p><span>To the venerable Nyanaponika Thera, German pupil of the venerable Ñāṇatiloka Mahāthera, for very kindly undertaking to check the whole manuscript in detail with the venerable Ñāṇatiloka Mahāthera’s German translation (I knowing no German).</span></p><p><span>To all those with whom I have had discussions on the Dhamma, which have been many and have contributed to the clearing up of not a few unclear points.</span></p><p><span>Lastly, and what is mentioned last bears its own special emphasis, it has been an act of singular merit on the part of Mr. A. Semage, of Colombo, to undertake to publish this translation.</span></p><p><span>Island Hermitage Dodanduwa, Sri Lanka</span></p><p><span>Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu, Vesākhamāse, 2499: May, 1956</span></p></section></section><section class="sect-dp2"><h1><span>Bibliography</span></h1><section class="sect-dp3"><h1><span>Printed Editions of the </span><em>Visuddhimagga</em></h1><p><em>Sinhalese script:</em><span> Hewavitarne Bequest edition, Colombo.</span></p><p><em>Burmese script:</em><span> Hanthawaddy Press edition, Rangoon, 1900.</span></p><p><em>Siamese script:</em><span> Royal Siamese edition, Bangkok.</span></p><p><em>Latin script:</em><span> Pali Text Society’s edition, London.

As the principal non-canonical authority of the </span><em>Theravāda, </em><span>it forms the hub of a complete and coherent method of exegesis of the Tipiṭaka, using the “Abhidhamma method” as it is called. And it sets out detailed practical instructions for developing purification of mind.</span></p><section class="sect-dp3"><h1><span>Background and Main Facts</span></h1><p><span>The works of Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa fill more than thirty volumes in the Pali Text Society’s Latin-script edition; but what is known of the writer himself is meager enough for a page or two to contain the bare facts.</span></p><p><span>Before dealing with those facts, however, and in order that they may appear oriented, it is worth while first to digress a little by noting how Pali literature falls naturally into three main historical periods. The early or classical period, which may be called the First Period, begins with the Tipiṭaka itself in the 6th century BCE and ends with the </span><em>Milindapañhā </em><span>about five centuries later. These works, composed in India, were brought to Sri Lanka, where they were maintained in Pali but written about in Sinhalese. By the first century CE, Sanskrit (independently of the rise of Mahayana) or a vernacular had probably quite displaced Pali as the medium of study in all the Buddhist “schools” on the Indian mainland. Literary activity in Sri Lanka declined and, it seems, fell into virtual abeyance between CE 150 and 350, as will appear below. The first Pali renascence was under way in Sri Lanka and South India by about 400 and was made viable by Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa. This can be called the Middle Period. Many of its principal figures were Indian. It developed in several centres in the South Indian mainland and spread to Burma, and it can be said to have lasted till about the 12th century. Meanwhile the renewed literary activity again declined in Sri Lanka till it was eclipsed by the disastrous invasion of Magha in the 11th</span><strong> </strong><span>century. The second renascence, or the Third Period as it may be termed, begins in the</span><strong> </strong><span>following century with Sri Lanka’s recovery, coinciding more or less with major political changes in Burma. In Sri Lanka it lasted for several centuries and in Burma for much longer, though India about that time or soon after lost all forms of Buddhism. But this period does not concern the present purpose and is only sketched in for the sake of perspective.</span></p><p><span>The recorded facts relating from the standpoint of Sri Lanka to the rise of the Middle Period are very few, and it is worthwhile tabling them.</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>Exact dates are not agreed. The </span><em>Sri Lanka Chronicles</em><span> give the lengths of reigns of kings of Sri Lanka back to the time of the Buddha and also of kings of Magadha from Asoka back to the same time. Calculated backwards the list gives 543 BCE as the year of the Buddha’s parinibbāna (see list of kings in Codrington’s </span><em>Short History of Ceylon</em><span>, Macmillan 1947, p. xvi.). For adjustments to this calculation that bring the date of the parinibbāna forward to 483 BCE (the date most generally accepted in Europe), see e.g. Geiger, </span><em>Mahāvaṃsa</em><span> translation (introduction) </span><em>Epigraphia Zeylanica </em><span>I, 156; E. J. Thomas, </span><em>Life of the Buddha</em><span>, Kegan Paul, p. 26, n.1. It seems certain, however, that Mahānāma was reigning in the year 428 because of a letter sent by him to the Chinese court (Codrington p. 29; E.Z. III, 12). If the adjusted date is accepted then 60 extra years have somehow to be squeezed out without displacing Mahānāma’s reign.

The violent upsets in his reign followed by his founding of the Abhayagiri Monastery, its secession and schism, changed the whole situation at home. Sensing insecurity, the Great Monastery took the precaution to commit the Tipiṭaka for the first time to writing, doing so in the provinces away from the king’s presence. Now by about the end of the first century BCE (dates are very vague), with Sanskrit Buddhist literature just launching out upon its long era of magnificence, Sanskrit was on its way to become a language of international culture. In Sri Lanka the Great Monastery, already committed by tradition to strict orthodoxy based on Pali, had been confirmed in that attitude by the schism of its rival, which now began publicly to study the new ideas from India. In the first century BCE probably the influx of Sanskrit thought was still quite small, so that the Great Monastery could well maintain its name in Anurādhapura as the principal centre of learning by developing its ancient Tipiṭaka commentaries in Sinhalese. This might account for the shift of emphasis from practice to scholarship in King Vaṭṭagāmani’s reign. Evidence shows great activity in this latter field throughout the first century BCE, and all this material was doubtless written down too.</span></p><p><span>In the first century CE, Sanskrit Buddhism (“Hīnayāna,” and perhaps by then Mahāyāna) was growing rapidly and spreading abroad. The Abhayagiri Monastery would naturally have been busy studying and advocating some of these weighty </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[33|xxxi]</span><span>developments while the Great Monastery had nothing new to offer: the rival was thus able, at some risk, to appear go-ahead and up-to-date while the old institution perhaps began to fall behind for want of new material, new inspiration and international connections, because its studies being restricted to the orthodox presentation in the Sinhalese language, it had already done what it could in developing Tipiṭaka learning (on the mainland Theravāda was doubtless deeper in the same predicament). Anyway we find that from the first century onwards its constructive scholarship dries up, and instead, with the reign of King Bhātika Abhaya (BCE 20–CE 9), public wrangles begin to break out between the two monasteries. This scene indeed drags on, gradually worsening through the next three centuries, almost bare as they are of illuminating information. King Vasabha’s reign (CE 66–110) seems to be the last mentioned in the Commentaries as we have them now, from which it may be assumed that soon afterwards they were closed (or no longer kept up), nothing further being added. Perhaps the Great Monastery, now living only on its past, was itself getting infected with heresies. But without speculating on the immediate reasons that induced it to let its chain of teachers lapse and to cease adding to its body of Sinhalese learning, it is enough to note that the situation went on deteriorating, further complicated by intrigues, till in Mahāsena’s reign (CE 277–304) things came to a head.</span></p><p><span>With the persecution of the Great Monastery given royal assent and the expulsion of its bhikkhus from the capital, the Abhayagiri Monastery enjoyed nine years of triumph. But the ancient institution rallied its supporters in the southern provinces and the king repented. The bhikkhus returned and the king restored the buildings, which had been stripped to adorn the rival. Still, the Great Monastery must have foreseen, after this affair, that unless it could successfully compete with Sanskrit it had small hope of holding its position. With that the only course open was to launch a drive for the rehabilitation of Pali—a drive to bring the study of that language up to a standard fit to compete with the “modern” Sanskrit in the field of international Buddhist culture: by cultivating Pali at home and abroad it could assure its position at home. It was a revolutionary project, involving the displacement of Sinhalese by Pali as the language for the study and discussion of Buddhist teachings, and the founding of a school of Pali literary composition. Earlier it would doubtless have been impracticable; but the atmosphere had changed. Though various Sanskrit non-Mahayana sects are well known to have continued to flourish all over India, there is almost nothing to show the status of the Pali language there by now. Only the </span><em>Mahāvaṃsa </em><span>[XXXVII.215f. quoted below] suggests that the Theravāda sect there had not only put aside but lost perhaps all of its old non-Piṭaka material dating from Asoka’s time.</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>See also </span><em>A Record of Buddhist Religion</em><span> by I-tsing, translation by J. Takakusu, Claren do Press, 1896, p. xxiii, where a geographical distribution of various schools gives Mūlasarvāstivāda mainly in the north and Ariyasthavira mainly in the south of India. I-tsing, who did not visit Sri Lanka, was in India at the end of the 7th cent.; but he does not mention whether the Ariyasthavira (Theravāda) Nikāya in India pursued its studies in the Pali of its Tipiṭaka or in Sanskrit or in a local vernacular.</span></span></span><span> One may guess that the pattern of things in Sri Lanka only echoed a process that had gone much further in India. But in the </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[34|xxxii]</span><span>island of Sri Lanka the ancient body of learning, much of it pre-Asokan, had been kept lying by, as it were maturing in its two and a half centuries of neglect, and it had now acquired a new and great potential value due to the purity of its pedigree in contrast with the welter of new original thinking. Theravāda centres of learning on the mainland were also doubtless much interested and themselves anxious for help in a repristinization.</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>In the epilogues and prologues of various works between the 5th and 12th centuries there is mention of e.g., Badaratittha (Vism-a prol.: near Chennai), Kañcipura (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A-a">A-a</a></span><span> epil.: = Conjevaram near Chennai), and other places where different teachers accepting the Great Monastery tradition lived and worked. See also Malalasekera, </span><em>Pali Literature of Ceylon,</em><span> p. 13; E.Z., IV, 69-71; Journal of Oriental Research, Madras, Vol. XIX, pp. 278f.</span></span></span><span>Without such cooperation there was little hope of success.</span></p><p><span>It is not known what was the first original Pali composition in this period; but the </span><em>Dīpavaṃsa </em><span>(dealing with historical evidence) belongs here (for it ends with Mahāsena’s reign and is quoted in the </span><em>Samantapāsādikā), </em><span>and quite possibly the </span><em>Vimuttimagga </em><span>(dealing with practice—see below) was another early attempt by the Great Monastery in this period (4th cent.) to reassert its supremacy through original Pali literary composition: there will have been others too.</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>Possibly the Vinaya summaries, </span><em>Mūlasikkhā</em><span> and </span><em>Khuddasikkhā</em><span> (though Geiger places these much later), as well as some works of Buddhadatta Thera. It has not been satisfactorily explained why the </span><em>Mahāvaṃsa,</em><span> composed in the late 4th or early 5th cent., ends abruptly in the middle of Chapter 37 with Mahāsena’s reign (the Chronicle being only resumed eight centuries later).</span></span></span><span>Of course, much of this is very conjectural. Still it is plain enough that by 400 CE a movement had begun, not confined to Sri Lanka, and that the time was ripe for the crucial work, for a Pali recension of the Sinhalese Commentaries with their unique tradition. Only the right personality, able to handle it competently, was yet lacking. That personality appeared in the first quarter of the fifth century.</span></p></section><section class="sect-dp3"><h1><span>The </span><em>Visuddhimagga</em><span> and its Author</span></h1><p><span>Sources of information about that person fall into three groups.

A constant supporter of the Community, trusting with unwavering faith in the Three Jewels, belonging to an illustrious family and known by the name of Mahānigamasāmi (Lord of the Great City), had an excellent work-room built there on its southern side accessible to the ever virtuously conducted Community of Bhikkhus. The building was beautifully appointed, agreeably endowed with cool shade and had a lavish water supply. The Vinaya Commentary was begun by me for the sake of the Elder Buddhasiri of pure virtuous behaviour while I was living there in Mahānigamasāmi’s building, and it is now complete. It was begun by me in the twentieth year of the reign of peace of the King Sirinivāsa (Of Glorious Life), the renowned and glorious guardian who has kept the whole of Lanka’s island free from trouble. It was finished in one year without mishap in a world beset by mishaps, so may all beings attain…’’</span><em> (</em><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vin-a">Vin-a</a><span> Epilogue</span></span><span>).</span></p><p><span>Mostly it is assumed that he wrote and “published” his works one by one as authors do today. The assumption may not be correct. There is an unerring consistency throughout the system of explanation he adopts, and there are cross-references between works. This suggests that while the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>itself may perhaps have been composed and produced first, the others as they exist now were more likely worked over contemporaneously and all more or less finished before any one of them was given out. They may well have been given out then following the order of the books in the Tipiṭaka which they explain. So in that way it may be taken that the Vinaya Commentary came next to the </span><em>Visuddhimagga; </em><span>then the Commentaries on the four Nikāyas (Collections of Suttas), and after them the Abhidhamma Commentaries. Though it is not said that the Vinaya Commentary was given out first of these, still the prologue and epilogue contain the most information. The four Nikāya Commentaries all have the same basic prologue; but the Saṃyutta Nikāya Commentary inserts in its prologue a stanza referring the reader to “the two previous Collections” (i.e. the Dīgha and Majjhima Nikāyas) for explanations of the names of towns and for illustrative stories, while the Aṅguttara </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[37|xxxv]</span><span>Nikāya Commentary replaces this stanza with another referring to “the Dīgha and Majjhima” by name for the same purpose. The point may seem laboured and even trivial, but it is not irrelevant; for if it is assumed that these works were written and “published” in some historical order of composition, one expects to find some corresponding development of thought and perhaps discovers what one’s assumption has projected upon them. The more likely assumption, based on consideration of the actual contents, is that their form and content was settled before any one of them was given out.</span></p><p><span>Sometimes it is argued that the commentaries to the Dhammapada and the Jātaka may not be by the same author because the style is different. But that fact could be accounted for by the difference in the subject matter; for these two commentaries consist mainly of popular stories, which play only a very minor role in the other works. Besides, while this author is quite inexorably consistent throughout his works in his explanations of Dhamma, he by no means always maintains that consistency in different versions of the same story in, say, different Nikāya Commentaries (compare for instance, the version of the story of Elder Tissabhūti given in the commentary to </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> 1:2.6</span></span><span>, with that at </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> I 66</span></span><span>; also the version of the story of the Elder Mahā Tissa in the </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A-a">A-a</a></span><span>, same ref., with that at </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> I 185</span></span><span>). Perhaps less need for strictness was felt with such story material. And there is also another possibility. It may not unreasonably be supposed that he did not work alone, without help, and that he had competent assistants. If so, he might well have delegated the drafting of the Khuddaka Nikāya commentaries—those of the Khuddakapāṭha and Suttanipāta, Dhammapada, and the Jātaka—or part of them, supervising and completing them himself, after which the official “postscript” was appended. This assumption seems not implausible and involves less difficulties than its alternatives.</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>A definite statement that the </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhp-a">Dhp-a</a></span><span> was written later by someone else can hardly avoid the inference that the “postscript” was a fraud, or at least misleading.</span></span></span><span>These secondary commentaries may well have been composed after the others.</span></p><p><span>The full early history of the Pali Tipiṭaka and its commentaries in Sinhalese is given in the Sri Lanka Chronicle, the </span><em>Dīpavaṃsa, </em><span>and </span><em>Mahāvaṃsa, </em><span>and also in the introduction to the Vinaya Commentary. In the prologue to each of the four Nikāya Commentaries it is conveniently summarized by Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa himself as follows: “[I shall now take] the commentary, whose object is to clarify the meaning of the subtle and most excellent Long Collection (Dīgha Nikāya) … set forth in detail by the Buddha and by his like [i.e. the Elder Sāriputta and other expounders of discourses in the Sutta Piṭaka]—the commentary that in the beginning was chanted [at the First Council] and later re-chanted [at the Second and Third], and was brought to the Sīhala Island (Sri Lanka) by the Arahant Mahinda the Great and rendered into the Sīhala tongue for the benefit of the islanders—and from that commentary I shall remove the Sīhala tongue, replacing it by the graceful language that conforms with Scripture and is purified and free from flaws. Not diverging from the standpoint of the elders residing in the Great Monastery [in Anurādhapura], who illumine the elders’ heritage and are all well </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[38|xxxvi]</span><span>versed in exposition, and rejecting subject matter needlessly repeated, I shall make the meaning clear for the purpose of bringing contentment to good people and contributing to the long endurance of the Dhamma.”</span></p><p><span>There are references in these works to “the Ancients” </span><em>(porāṇā) </em><span>or “Former Teachers” </span><em>(pubbācariyā) </em><span>as well as to a number of Sinhalese commentaries additional to the three referred to in the quotation given earlier. The fact is plain enough that a complete body of commentary had been built up during the nine centuries or so that separate Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa from the Buddha. A good proportion of it dated no doubt from the actual time of the Buddha himself, and this core had been added to in India (probably in Pali), and later by learned elders in Sri Lanka (in Sinhalese) as references to their pronouncements show (e.g. </span><a href="#XII.105">XII.105</a><span> and </span><a href="#XII.117">117</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>This body of material—one may guess that its volume was enormous—Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa set himself to edit and render into Pali (the Tipiṭaka itself had been left in the original Pali). For this he had approval and express invitation (see, e.g., the epilogue to the present work, which the Elder Saṅghapāla invited him to compose). Modern critics have reproached him with lack of originality: but if we are to judge by his declared aims, originality, or to use his own phrase “advertising his own standpoint” (</span><a href="#XVII.25">XVII.25</a><span>), seems likely to have been one of the things he would have wished to avoid. He says, for instance, “I shall expound the comforting </span><em>Path of Purification, </em><span>pure in expositions, relying on the teaching of the dwellers in the Great Monastery” (</span><a href="#I.4">I.4</a><span>; see also epilogue), and again “Now, as to the entire trustworthiness </span><em>(samantapāsādikatta) </em><span>of this </span><em>Samantapāsādika</em><span>: the wise see nothing untrustworthy here when they look—in the chain of teachers, in the citations of circumstance, instance and category [in each case], in the avoidance of others’ standpoints, in the purity of [our] own standpoint, in the correctness of details, in the word-meanings, in the order of construing the text, in the exposition of the training precepts, in the use of classification by the analytical method—which is why this detailed commentary on the Vinaya … is called </span><em>Samantapāsādika </em><span>(</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vin-a">Vin-a</a></span><span> epilogue). And then: “The commentary on the Pātimokkha, which I began at the request of the Elder Soṇa for the purpose of removing doubts in those uncertain of the Vinaya, and which covers the whole Sinhalese commentarial system based upon the arrangement adopted by the dwellers in the Great Monastery, is finished. The whole essence of the commentary and the entire meaning of the text has been extracted and there is no sentence here that might conflict with the text or with the commentaries of the dwellers in the Great Monastery or those of the Ancients” (Pātimokkha Commentary epilogue). Such examples could be multiplied (see especially also </span><a href="#XVII.25">XVII.25</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>There is only one instance in the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>where he openly advances an opinion of his own, with the words “our preference here is this” (</span><a href="#XIII.123">XIII.123</a><span>). He does so once in the Majjhima Nikāya Commentary, too, saying “the point is not dealt with by the Ancients, but this is my opinion” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> I 28</span></span><span>). The rarity of such instances and the caution expressed in them imply that he himself was disinclined to speculate and felt the need to point the fact out when he did. He actually says “one’s own opinion is the weakest authority of all and should only be accepted if it accords with the Suttas” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D-a">D-a</a><span> 567–568</span></span><span>). So it is likely that </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[39|xxxvii]</span><span>he regarded what we should call original thinking as the province of the Buddha, and his own task as the fortification of that thought by coordinating the explanations of it. However, not every detail that he edited can claim direct support in the Suttas.</span></p><p><span>The following considerations lend some support to the assumptions just made. It has been pointed out</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>Adikaram, </span><em>Early History of Buddhism in Ceylon</em><span>, pp. 3 and 86.</span></span></span><span>that in describing in the Vinaya Commentary how the tradition had been “maintained up to the present day by the chain of teachers and pupils” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vin-a">Vin-a</a><span> 61–62</span></span><span>) the list of teachers’ names that follows contains names only traceable down to about the middle of the 2</span><span>nd</span><span> century CE, but not later. Again, there appear in his works numbers of illustrative stories, all of which are set either in India or Sri Lanka. However, no single one of them can be pointed to as contemporary. Stories about India in every case where a date can be assigned are not later than Asoka (3</span><span>rd</span><span> cent. BCE). Many stories about Sri Lanka cannot be dated, but of those that can none seems later than the 2</span><span>nd</span><span> century CE. This suggests that the material which he had before him to edit and translate had been already completed and fixed more than two centuries earlier in Sri Lanka, and that the words “present day” were not used by him to refer to his own time, but were already in the material he was coordinating. This final fixing, if it is a fact, might have been the aftermath of the decision taken in Sri Lanka in the first century BCE to commit the Pali Tipiṭaka to writing.</span></p><p><span>Something now needs to be said about the relation of the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>to the other books. This author’s work is characterized by relentless accuracy, consistency, and fluency of erudition, and much dominated by formalism. Not only is this formalism evident in the elaborate pattern of the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>but also that work’s relationship to the others is governed by it. The </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>itself extracts from the Tipiṭaka all the central doctrines that pivot upon the Four Noble Truths, presenting them as a coherent systematic whole by way of quotation and explanation interspersed with treatises on subjects of more or less relative importance, all being welded into an intricate edifice. The work can thus stand alone. But the aim of the commentaries to the four main Nikāyas or Collections of Suttas is to explain the subject matter of individual discourses and, as well, certain topics and special doctrines not dealt with in the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>(many passages commenting on identical material in the Suttas in different Nikāyas are reproduced </span><em>verbatim </em><span>in each commentary, and elsewhere, e.g., MN 10, cf. DN 22, Satipaṭṭhāna Vibhaṅga, etc., etc., and respective commentaries). But these commentaries always refer the reader to the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>for explanations of the central doctrines. And though the Vinaya and Abhidhamma (commentaries are less closely bound to the </span><em>Visuddhimagga, </em><span>still they too either refer the reader to it or reproduce large blocks of it. The author himself says: “The treatises on virtue and on the ascetic’s rules, all the meditation subjects, the details of the attainments of the jhānas, together with the directions for each temperament, all the various kinds of direct-knowledge, the exposition of the definition of understanding, the aggregates, elements, bases, and faculties, the Four Noble Truths, the explanation </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[40|xxxviii]</span><span>of the structure of conditions (dependent origination), and lastly the development of insight, by methods that are purified and sure and not divergent from Scripture—since these things have already been quite clearly stated in the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>I shall no more dwell upon them here; for the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>stands between and in the midst of all four Collections (Nikāyas) and will clarify the meaning of such things stated therein. It was made in that way: take it therefore along with this same commentary and know the meaning of the Long Collection (Dīgha Nikāya)” (prologue to the four Nikāyas).</span></p><p><span>This is all that can, without unsafe inferences, be gleaned of Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa himself from his own works (but see below). Now, there is the </span><em>Mahāvaṃsa </em><span>account. The composition of the second part (often called </span><em>Cūḷavaṃsa) </em><span>of that historical poem is attributed to an Elder Dhammakitti, who lived in or about the thirteenth century. Here is a translation of the relevant passage:</span></p><p><span>“There was a Brahman student who was born near the site of the Enlightenment Tree. He was acquainted with the arts and accomplishments of the sciences and was qualified in the Vedas. He was well versed in what he knew and unhesitant over any phrase. Being interested in doctrines, he wandered over Jambudīpa (India) engaging in disputation.</span></p><p><span>“He came to a certain monastery, and there in the night he recited Pātañjali’s system with each phrase complete and well rounded. The senior elder there, Revata by name, recognized, ‘This is a being of great understanding who ought to be tamed.’ He said, ‘Who is that braying the ass’s bray?’ The other asked, ‘What, then, do you know the meaning of the ass’s bray?’ The elder answered, ‘I know it,’ and he then not only expounded it himself, but explained each statement in the proper way and also pointed out contradictions. The other then urged him, ‘Now expound your own doctrine,’ and the elder repeated a text from the Abhidhamma, but the visitor could not solve its meaning. He asked, ‘Whose system is this?’ and the elder replied, ‘It is the Enlightened One’s system.’ ‘Give it to me,’ he said, but the elder answered, ‘You will have to take the going forth into homelessness.’ So he took the going forth, since he was interested in the system, and he learned the three Piṭakas, after which he believed, ‘This is the only way’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 55</span></span><span>). Because his speech </span><em>(ghosa) </em><span>was profound (voice was deep) like that of the Enlightened One </span><em>(Buddha) </em><span>they called him Buddhaghosa, so that like the Enlightened One he might be voiced over the surface of the earth.</span></p><p><span>“He prepared a treatise there called </span><em>Ñāṇodaya, </em><span>and then the </span><em>Atthasālinī, </em><span>a commentary on the Dhammasaṅgaṇī. Next he began work on a commentary to the </span><em>Paritta</em><span>.</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><em>Paritta</em><span> or “protection”: a name for certain suttas recited for that purpose. See </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> IV 114</span></span><span>.</span></span></span><span> When the Elder Revata saw that, he said, ‘Here only the text has been preserved. There is no commentary here, and likewise no Teachers’ Doctrine; for that has been allowed to go to pieces and is no longer known. However, a Sinhalese commentary still exists, which is pure. It was rendered into the Sinhalese tongue by the learned Mahinda with proper regard for the</span><span class="vism-page-bps">[41|xxxix]</span><span> way of commenting that was handed down by the three Councils as taught by the Enlightened One and inculcated by Sāriputta and others. Go there, and after you have learnt it translate it into the language of the Magadhans. That will bring benefit to the whole world.’ As soon as this was said, he made up his mind to set out.</span></p><p><em>“</em><span>He came from there to this island in the reign of this king (Mahānāma). He came to the (Great Monastery, the monastery of all true men. There he stayed in a large workroom, and he learnt the whole Sinhalese Commentary of the Elders’ Doctrine </span><em>(theravāda) </em><span>under Saṅghapāla.</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>See Vism epilogue.</span></span></span><span> He decided, ‘This alone is the intention of the Dhamma’s Lord.’ So he assembled the Community there and asked, ‘Give me all the books to make a commentary.’ Then in order to test him the Community gave him two stanzas, saying ‘Show your ability with these; when we have seen that you have it, we will give you all the books.’ On that text alone he summarized the three Piṭakas together with the Commentary as an epitome, which was named the </span><em>Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga). </em><span>Then, in the precincts of the (sapling of the) Enlightenment Tree (in Anurādhapura), he assembled the Community expert in the Fully Enlightened One’s system, and he began to read it out. In order to demonstrate his skill to the multitude deities hid the book, and he was obliged to prepare it a second time, and again a third time. When the book was brought for the third time to be read out, the gods replaced the other two copies with it. Then the bhikkhus read out the three copies together, and it was found that there was no difference between the three in either the chapters or the meaning or the order of the material or the phrases and syllables of the Theravāda texts. With that the Community applauded in high delight and again and again it was said, ‘Surely this is (the Bodhisatta) Metteyya.’ “They gave him the books of the three Piṭakas together with the Commentary. Then, while staying undisturbed in the Library Monastery, he translated the Sinhalese Commentary into the Magadhan language, the root-speech of all, by which he brought benefit to beings of all tongues. The teachers of the Elders’ Tradition accepted it as equal in authority with the texts themselves. Then, when the tasks to be done were finished, he went back to Jambudīpa to pay homage to the Great Enlightenment Tree.</span></p><p><em>“</em><span>And when Mahānāma had enjoyed twenty-two years’ reign upon earth and had performed a variety of meritorious works, he passed on according to his deeds”—(</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Mhv">Mhv</a><span> XXXVII.215–47</span></span><span>).</span></p><p><span>King Mahānāma is identified with the “King Sirinivāsa” and the “King Sirikuḍḍa” mentioned respectively in the epilogues to the Vinaya and Dhammapada Commentaries. There is no trace, and no other mention anywhere, of the </span><em>Ñāṇodaya. </em><span>The </span><em>Atthasālinī </em><span>described as composed in India could not be the version extant today, which cites the Sri Lankan Commentaries and refers to the </span><em>Visuddhimagga; </em><span>it will have been revised later.</span></p><p><span>The prologues and epilogues of this author’s works are the only instances in which we can be sure that he is speaking of his own experience and not only simply editing; and while they point only to his residence in South India, they neither </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[42|xl]</span><span>confute nor confirm the </span><em>Mahāvaṃsa </em><span>statement that he was born in Magadha (see note 8). The Sri Lankan Chronicles survived the historical criticism to which they were subjected in the last hundred years. The independent evidence that could be brought to bear supported them, and Western scholars ended by pronouncing them reliable in essentials. The account just quoted is considered to be based on historical fact even if it contains legendary matter.</span></p><p><span>It is not possible to make use of the body of Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa’s works to test the </span><em>Mahāvaṃsa’s</em><span> claim that he was a learned Brahman from central India, and so on. It has been shown already how the presumption is always, where the contrary is not explicitly stated, that he is editing and translating material placed before him rather than displaying his own private knowledge, experience and opinions. And so it would be a critical mistake to use any such passage in his work for assessing his personal traits; for in them it is, pretty certainly, not him we are dealing with at all but people who lived three or more centuries earlier. Those passages probably tell us merely that he was a scrupulously accurate and conscientious editor. His geographical descriptions are translations, not eyewitness accounts. Then such a sutta passage as that commented on in </span><a href="#I.86">Chapter I, 86</a><span>–</span><a href="#I.97">97</a><span> of the present work, which is a part of a sutta used by bhikkhus for daily reflection on the four requisites of the life of a bhikkhu, is certain to have been fully commented on from the earliest times, so that it would be just such a critical mistake to infer from this comment anything about his abilities as an original commentator, or anything else of a personal nature about him or his own past experience.</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>For instance, Prof. Kosambi, in his preface to the </span><em>Visuddhimagga</em><span>, Harvard ed., overlooks these considerations when he says: “More positive evidence (that he was not a North-Indian Brahman) is in the passage </span><em>’Uṇhassa ti aggisantāpassa. Tassa vanadāhādisu sambhavo veditabbo’ </em><span>(</span><a href="#I.86">I.86</a><span>). ’Heat: the heat of fire, such as occurs at the time of forest fires, etc.’” This is a comment upon protection against heat given by a </span><em>cīvara</em><span>. His explanation is obviously ridiculous: “It is not known to Indian southerners that a bare skin is sure to be sunburnt in the northern summer” (p. xii). And Professor Kosambi has not only overlooked the fact that it is almost certainly translated material that he is criticizing as original composition, but he appears not to have even read the whole passage. The sutta sentence (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 10</span></span><span>) commented on in the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>(</span><a href="#I.86">I.86</a><span>-</span><a href="#I.87">87</a><span>) contains two words </span><em>uṇha </em><span>and </span><em>ātapa. </em><span>If, before condemning the explanation as “ridiculous,” he had read on, he would have found, a line or two below, the words </span><em>Ātapo ti suriyātapo </em><span>(“‘Burning’ is burning of the sun”—</span><a href="#I.87">I.87</a><span>).</span></span></span><span>And again, the controversial subject of the origin of the Brahman caste (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> II 418</span></span><span>) must have been fully explained from the Buddhist standpoint from the very start. If then that account disagrees with Brahmanical lore—and it would be odd, all things considered, if it did not—there is no justification for concluding on those grounds that the author of the </span><em>Visuddhimagga</em><span> was not of Brahman origin and that the </span><em>Mahāvaṃsa</em><span> is wrong. What does indeed seem improbable is that the authorities of the Great Monastery, resolutely committed to oppose unorthodoxy, would have given him a free hand to “correct” their traditions to accord with Brahmanical texts or with other alien sources, even if he had so wished. Again, the fact that there are allusions to extraneous, non-Buddhist literature (e.g. </span><a href="#VII.58">VII.58</a><span>; </span><a href="#XVI.4n2">XVI.4 n.2</a><span>; </span><a href="#XVI.85">XVI.85</a><span>, etc.) hardly affects this issue because they too can have been already in the </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[43|xli]</span><span>material he was editing or supplied to him by the elders with whom he was working. What might repay careful study are perhaps those things, such as certain Mahayana teachings and names, as well as much Brahmanical philosophy, which he ignores though he must have known about them. This ignoring cannot safely be ascribed to ignorance unless we are sure it was not dictated by policy; and we are not sure at all. His silences (in contrast to the author of the </span><em>Paramatthamañjūsā</em><span>) are sometimes notable in this respect.</span></p><p><span>The “popular novel” called </span><em>Buddhaghosuppatti</em><span>, which was composed in Burma by an elder called Mahāmaṅgala, perhaps as early as the 15th century, is less dependable. But a survey without some account of it would be incomplete. So here is a </span><em>précis</em><span>:</span></p><p><span>Near the Bodhi Tree at Gayā there was a town called Ghosa. Its ruler had a Brahman chaplain called Kesi married to a wife called Kesinī. An elder bhikkhu, who was a friend of Kesi, used to wonder, when the Buddha’s teaching was recited in Sinhalese, and people did not therefore understand it, who would be able to translate it into Magadhan (Pāḷi). He saw that there was the son of a deity living in the Tāvatiṃsa heaven, whose name was Ghosa and who was capable of doing it. This deity was persuaded to be reborn in the human world as the son of the Brahman Kesi. He learnt the Vedas. One day he sat down in a place sacred to Vishnu and ate peas. Brahmans angrily rebuked him, but he uttered a stanza, “The pea itself is Vishnu; who is there called Vishnu? And how shall I know which is Vishnu?” and no one could answer him. Then one day while Kesi was instructing the town’s ruler in the Vedas a certain passage puzzled him, but Ghosa wrote down the explanations on a palm leaf, which was found later by his father—(Chapter I).</span></p><p><span>Once when the elder bhikkhu was invited to Kesi’s house for a meal Ghosa’s mat was given to him to sit on. Ghosa was furious and abused the elder. Then he asked him if he knew the Vedas and any other system. The elder gave a recitation from the Vedas. Then Ghosa asked him for his own system, whereupon the elder expounded the first triad of the Abhidhamma schedule, on profitable, unprofitable, and indeterminate thought-arisings. Ghosa asked whose the system was. He was told that it was the Buddha’s and that it could only be learnt after becoming a bhikkhu. He accordingly went forth into homelessness as a bhikkhu, and in one month he learned the three Piṭakas. After receiving the full admission he acquired the four discriminations. The name given to him was Buddhaghosa—(Chapter II).</span></p><p><span>One day the question arose in his mind: “Who has more understanding of the Buddha-word, I or my preceptor?” His preceptor, whose cankers were exhausted, read the thought in his mind and rebuked him, telling him to ask his forgiveness. The pupil was then very afraid, and after asking for forgiveness, he was told that in order to make amends he must go to Sri Lanka and translate the Buddha-word (</span><em>sic</em><span>) from Sinhalese into Magadhan. He agreed, but asked that he might first be allowed to convert his father from the Brahman religion to the Buddha’s teaching. In order to achieve this he had a brick apartment fitted with locks and furnished with food and water. He set a contrivance so that when his father went inside he was trapped. He then preached to his father on the virtues of the Buddha, and on the pains of hell resulting from wrong belief. After three days his father was converted, and he took the Three Refuges. The son then opened the door and made </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[44|xlii]</span><span>opened the door and made amends to his father with flowers and such things for the offence done to him. Kesi became a stream-enterer—(Chapter III).</span></p><p><span>This done, he set sail in a ship for Sri Lanka. The Mahāthera Buddhadatta</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>The allusion is to the author of various Pali works including the </span><em>Abhidhammāvatāra; </em><span>see n. 4.</span></span></span><span> had set sail that day from Sri Lanka for India. The two ships met by the intervention of Sakka Ruler of Gods. When the two elders saw each other, the Elder Buddhaghosa told the other: “The Buddha’s Dispensation has been put into Sinhalese; I shall go and translate it and put it into Magadhan.” The other said, “I was sent to go and translate the Buddha-word and write it in Magadhan. I have only done the </span><em>Jinālaṅkāra</em><span>, the </span><em>Dantavaṃsa</em><span>, the </span><em>Dhātuvaṃsa</em><span> and the </span><em>Bodhivaṃsa</em><span>, not the commentaries and the sub-commentaries (</span><em>ṭīkā</em><span>). If you, sir, are translating the Dispensation from Sinhalese into Magadhan, do the commentaries to the Three Piṭakas.” Then praising the Elder Buddhaghosa, he gave him the gall-nut, the iron stylus, and the stone given him by Sakka Ruler of Gods, adding, “If you have eye trouble or backache, rub the gall-nut on the stone and wet the place that hurts; then your ailment will vanish.” Then he recited a stanza from his </span><em>Jinālaṅkāra. </em><span>The other said, “Venerable sir, your book is written in very ornate style. Future clansmen will not be able to follow its meaning. It is hard for simple people to understand it.”—“Friend Buddhaghosa, I went to Sri Lanka before you to work on the Blessed One’s Dispensation. But I have little time before me and shall not live long. So I cannot do it. Do it therefore yourself, and do it well.” Then the two ships separated. Soon after they had completed their voyages the Elder Buddhadatta died and was reborn in the Tusita heaven—(Chapter IV).</span></p><p><span>The Elder Buddhaghosa stayed near the port of Dvijaṭhāna in Sri Lanka. While there he saw one woman water-carrier accidentally break another’s jar, which led to a violent quarrel between them with foul abuse. Knowing that he might be called as a witness, he wrote down what they said in a book. When the case came before the king, the elder was cited as a witness. He sent his notebook, which decided the case. The king then asked to see him—(Chapter V).</span></p><p><span>After this the elder went to pay homage to the Saṅgharāja,</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><em>Saṅgharāja </em><span>(“Ruler of the Community”—a title existing in Thailand today): possibly a mistake for Saṅghapāla here (see Vis. epil.).</span></span></span><span>the senior elder of Sri Lanka. One day while the senior elder was teaching bhikkhus he came upon a difficult point of Abhidhamma that he could not explain. The Elder Buddhaghosa knew its meaning and wrote it on a board after the senior elder had left. Next day it was discovered and then the senior elder suggested that he should teach the Order of Bhikkhus. The reply was: “I have come to translate the Buddha’s Dispensation into Magadhan.” The senior elder told him, “If so, then construe the Three Piṭakas upon the text beginning, ‘When a wise man, established well in virtue…’” He began the work that day, the stars being favourable, and wrote very quickly. When finished, he put it aside and went to sleep. Meanwhile Sakka, Ruler of Gods, abstracted the book. The elder awoke, and missing it, he wrote another copy very fast by lamplight then he put it aside and slept. Sakka abstracted that </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[45|xliii]</span><span>too. The elder awoke, and not seeing his book, he wrote a third copy very fast by lamplight and wrapped it in his robe. Then he slept again. While he was asleep Sakka put the other two books beside him, and when he awoke he found all three copies. He took them to the senior elder and told him what had happened. When they were read over there was no difference even in a single letter. Thereupon the senior elder gave permission for the translating of the Buddha’s Dispensation. From then on the elder was known to the people of Sri Lanka by the name of Buddhaghosa—(Chapter VI).</span></p><p><span>He was given apartments in the Brazen Palace, of whose seven floors he occupied the lowest. He observed the ascetic practices and was expert in all the scriptures. It was during his stay there that he translated the Buddha’s Dispensation. When on his alms round he saw fallen palm leaves he would pick them up; this was a duty undertaken by him. One day a man who had climbed a palm tree saw him. He left some palm leaves on the ground, watched him pick them up, and then followed him. Afterwards he brought him a gift of food. The elder concluded his writing of the Dispensation in three months. When the rainy season was over and he had completed the Pavāraṇā ceremony, he consigned the books to the senior elder, the Saṅgharāja. Then the Elder Buddhaghosa had the books written by Elder Mahinda piled up and burnt near the Great Shrine; the pile was as high as seven elephants. Now that this work was done, and wanting to see his parents, he took his leave before going back to India. Before he left, however, his knowledge of Sanskrit was queried by bhikkhus; but he silenced this by delivering a sermon in the language by the Great Shrine. Then he departed—(Chapter VII).</span></p><p><span>On his return he went to his preceptor and cleared himself of his penance. His parents too forgave him his offences; and when they died they were reborn in the Tusita heaven. He himself, knowing that he would not live much longer, paid homage to his preceptor and went to the Great Enlightenment Tree. Foreseeing his approaching death, he considered thus: “There are three kinds of death: death as cutting off, momentary death, and conventional death. Death as cutting off belongs to those whose cankers are exhausted (and are Arahants). Momentary death is that of each consciousness of the cognitive series beginning with life-continuum consciousness, which arise each immediately on the cessation of the one preceding. Conventional death is that of all (so-called) living beings.</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>A learned allusion to </span><a href="#VIII.1">VIII.1</a><span>.</span></span></span><span>Mine will be conventional death.” After his death he was reborn in the Tusita heaven in a golden mansion seven leagues broad surrounded with divine nymphs. When the Bodhisatta Metteyya comes to this human world, he will be his disciple. After his cremation his relics were deposited near the Enlightenment Tree and shrines erected over them—(Chapter VIII).</span></p><p><span>It has already been remarked that the general opinion of European scholars is that where this imaginative tale differs from, or adds to, the </span><em>Mahāvaṃsa’s </em><span>account it is in legend rather than history.</span></p><p><span>Finally there is the question of the Talaing Chronicles of Burma, which mention an elder named Buddhaghosa, of brahman stock, who went from Thatōn </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[46|xliv]</span><span>(the ancient Buddhist stronghold in the Rāmaññadesa of Burma) to Sri Lanka (perhaps via India) to translate the Buddha-word into Talaing and bring it back. It is hard to evaluate this tradition on the evidence available; but according to the opinion of the more reliable Western scholars another elder of the same name is involved here.</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>Hastings’ </span><em>Encyclopaedia of Religion, </em><span>article “Buddhaghosa” by T. W. Rhys Davids. Note also that another elder of the same name invited the writing of the </span><em>Sammohavinodanī. </em><span>The problem is discussed at some length by Prof. Niharranjan Ray, </span><em>Theravada Buddhism in Burma, </em><span>pp. 24ff.</span></span></span></p><p><span>What can be said of the </span><em>Visuddhimagga’s </em><span>author without venturing into unfounded speculation is now exhausted, at least in so far as the restricted scope of this introduction permits. The facts are tantalizingly few. Indeed this, like many scenes in Indian history, has something of the enigmatic transparencies and uncommunicative shadows of a moonlit landscape—at the same time inescapable and ungraspable.</span></p><p><span>Some answer has, however, been furnished to the two questions: why did he come to Sri Lanka? And why did his work become famous beyond its shores? Trends such as have been outlined, working not quite parallel on the Theravāda of India and Sri Lanka, had evolved a situation favouring a rehabilitation of Pali, and consequently the question was already one of interest not only to Sri Lanka, where the old material was preserved. Again the author possessed outstandingly just those personal qualities most fitted to the need—accuracy, an indefatigable mental orderliness, and insight able to crystallize the vast, unwieldy, accumulated exegesis of the Tipiṭaka into a coherent workable whole with a dignified vigorous style, respect for authenticity and dislike of speculation, and (in the circumstances not at all paradoxically) preference for self-effacement. The impetus given by him to Pali scholarship left an indelible mark on the centuries that followed, enabling it to survive from then on the Sanskrit siege as well as the continuing schism and the political difficulties and disasters that harassed Sri Lanka before the “Second Renascence.” A long epoch of culture stems from him. His successors in the Great Monastery tradition continued to write in various centres in South India till the 12</span><span>th</span><span> century or so, while his own works spread to Burma and beyond. Today in Sri Lanka and South East Asia his authority is as weighty as it ever was and his name is venerated as before.</span></p></section><section class="sect-dp3"><h1><span>The </span><em>Vimuttimagga</em></h1><p><span>Besides the books in Sinhala Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa names as available to him (which have all disappeared) there was also a manual (existing now only in a Chinese translation of the 6th century CE), presumed to have been written in Pali. Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa himself makes no mention of it; but his commentator, Bhadantācariya Dhammapāla (writing perhaps within two centuries of him), mentions it by name (see </span><a href="#III.n19">Ch. III, n.19</a><span>). The </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>refutes a certain method of classifying temperaments as unsound. The Elder Dhammapāla ascribes the theory refuted to the </span><em>Vimuttimagga. </em><span>The theory refuted is actually found in the Chinese version. Then other points rejected by the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>are found in the </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[47|xlv]</span><em>Vimuttimagga. </em><span>Some of these are attributed by the Elder Dhammapāla to the Abhayagiri Monastery. However, the </span><em>Vimuttimagga </em><span>itself contains nothing at all of the Mahāyāna, its unorthodoxies being well within the “Hīnayāna” field.</span></p><p><span>The book is much shorter than the </span><em>Visuddhimagga. </em><span>Though set out in the same three general divisions of virtue, concentration, and understanding, it does not superimpose the pattern of the seven purifications. Proportionately much less space is devoted to understanding, and there are no stories. Though the appearance in both books of numbers of nearly identical passages suggests that they both drew a good deal from the same sources, the general style differs widely. The four measureless states and the four immaterial states are handled differently in the two books. Besides the “material octads,” “enneads” and “decads,” it mentions “endecads,” etc., too. Its description of the thirteen ascetic practices is quite different. Also Abhidhamma, which is the keystone of Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa’s exegesis, is not used at all in the </span><em>Vimuttimagga </em><span>(aggregates, truths, etc., do not </span><em>in themselves </em><span>constitute Abhidhamma in the sense of that Piṭaka). There is for instance even in its description of the consciousness aggregate, no reference to the Dhammasaṅgaṇī’s classification of 89 types, and nothing from the Paṭṭhāna; and though the cognitive series is stated once in its full form (in Ch. 11) no use is made of it to explain conscious workings. This </span><em>Vimuttimagga </em><span>is in fact a book of practical instructions, not of exegesis.</span></p><p><span>Its authorship is ascribed to an Elder Upatissa. But the mere coincidence of names is insufficient to identify him with the Arahant Upatissa (prior to 3</span><span>rd</span><span> cent. CE) mentioned in the Vinaya Parivāra. A plausible theory puts its composition sometime before the </span><em>Visuddhimagga, </em><span>possibly in India. That is quite compatible with its being a product of the Great Monastery before the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>was written, though again evidence is needed to support the hypothesis. That it contains some minor points accepted by the Abhayagiri Monastery does not necessarily imply that it had any special connections with that centre. The source may have been common to both. The disputed points are not schismatical. Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa himself never mentions it.</span></p></section><section class="sect-dp3"><h1><span>Trends in the Development of Theravāda doctrine</span></h1><p><span>The doctrines (Dhamma) of the Theravāda Pali tradition can be conveniently traced in three main layers. (1) The first of these contains the main books of the Pali Sutta Piṭakas. (2) The second is the Abhidhamma Piṭaka, notably the closely related books, the Dhammasaṅgaṇī, Vibhaṅga, Paṭṭhāna. (3) The third is the system which the author of the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>completed, or found completed, and which he set himself to edit and translate back into Pali (some further minor developments took place subsequently, particularly with the 12th century (?) </span><em>Abhidhammatthasaṅgaha, </em><span>but they are outside the present scope). The point at issue here is not the much-debated historical question of how far the Abhidhamma books (leaving aside the Kathāvatthu) were contemporary with the Vinaya and Suttas, but rather what discernible direction they show in evolution of thought.</span></p><p><span>(1) The Suttas being taken as the original exposition of the Buddha’s teaching, (2) the Abhidhamma Piṭaka itself appears as a highly technical and specialized systematization, or complementary set of modifications built </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[48|xlvi]</span><span>upon that. Its immediate purpose is, one may say, to describe and pin-point mental constituents and characteristics and relate them to their material basis and to each other (with the secondary object, perhaps, of providing an efficient defence in disputes with heretics and exponents of outsiders’ doctrines). Its ultimate purpose is to furnish additional techniques for getting rid of unjustified assumptions that favour clinging and so obstruct the attainment of the extinction of clinging. Various instruments have been forged in it for sorting and re-sorting experience expressed as </span><em>dhammas </em><span>(see </span><a href="#VII.n1">Ch. VII, n.1</a><span>). These instruments are new to the Suttas, though partly traceable to them. The principal instruments peculiar to it are three: (a) the strict treatment of experience (or the knowable and knowledge, using the words in their widest possible sense) in terms of momentary cognizable states </span><em>(dhamma) </em><span>and the definition of these states, which is done in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī and Vibhaṅga; (b) the creation of a ”schedule” </span><em>(mātikā) </em><span>consisting of a set of triple </span><em>(tika) </em><span>and double </span><em>(duka) </em><span>classifications for sorting these states; and (c) the enumeration of twenty-four kinds of conditioning relations </span><em>(paccaya), </em><span>which is done in the Paṭṭhāna. The states as defined are thus, as it were, momentary “stills”; the structure of relations combines the stills into continuities; the schedule classifications indicate the direction of the continuities.</span></p><p><span>The three Abhidhamma books already mentioned are the essential basis for what later came to be called the “Abhidhamma method”: together they form an integral whole. The other four books, which may be said to support them in various technical fields, need not be discussed here. This, then, is a bare outline of what is in fact an enormous maze with many unexplored side-turnings.</span></p><p><span>(3) The system found in the Commentaries has moved on (perhaps slightly diverged) from the strict Abhidhamma Piṭaka standpoint. The Suttas offered descriptions of discovery; the Abhidhamma map-making; but emphasis now is not on discovery, or even on mapping, so much as on consolidating, filling in and explaining. The material is worked over for consistency. Among the principal new developments here are these. The “cognitive series” (</span><em>citta-vīthi</em><span>) in the occurrence of the conscious process is organized (see </span><a href="#IV.n13">Ch. IV, n.13</a><span> and Table V) and completed, and its association with three different kinds of kamma is laid down. The term </span><em>sabhāva</em><span> (“individual essence,” “own-being” or “it-ness,” see </span><a href="#VII.n68">Ch. VII, n.68</a><span>) is introduced to explain the key word </span><em>dhamma</em><span>, thereby submitting that term to ontological criticism, while the </span><em>samaya</em><span> (“event” or “occasion”) of the Dhammasaṅgaṇī is now termed a </span><em>khaṇa</em><span> (“moment”), thus shifting the weight and balance a little in the treatment of time. Then there is the specific ascription of the three “instants” (</span><em>khaṇa</em><span>, too) of arising, presence and dissolution (</span><em>uppāda-ṭṭhiti-bhaṅga</em><span>) to each “moment” (</span><em>khaṇa</em><span>), one “material moment” being calculated to last as long as sixteen “mental moments” (</span><a href="#XX.24">XX.24</a><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhs-a">Dhs-a</a><span> 60</span></span><span>).</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>The legitimateness of the mental moment of “presence” </span><em>(ṭhiti) </em><span>as deducible from </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> I 152</span></span><span> is questioned by Ācariya Ānanda (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh-ṭ">Vibh-ṭ</a></span><span>), who wrote early in the Middle Period; he cites the Yamaka (refs.: II 13–14; and I 216-17) against it.</span></span></span><span>New to the Piṭakas are also the rather unwieldy enumeration of concepts </span><em>(paññatti, </em><span>see </span><a href="#VIII.n11">Ch. VIII, n.11</a><span>), and the </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[49|xlvii]</span><span>handy defining-formula of word-meaning, characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause (locus); also many minor instances such as the substitution of the specific “heart-basis” for the Paṭṭhāna’s “material basis of mind,” the conception of “material octads,” etc., the detailed descriptions of the thirty-two parts of the body instead of the bare enumeration of the names in the Suttas (thirty-one in the four Nikāyas and thirty-two in the Khuddakapāṭha and the Paṭisambhidāmagga), and many more. And the word </span><em>paramattha </em><span>acquires a new and slightly altered currency. The question of how much this process of development owes to the post-Mauryan evolution of Sanskrit thought on the Indian mainland (either through assimilation or opposition) still remains to be explored, like so many others in this field. The object of this sketch is only to point to a few landmarks.</span></p></section><section class="sect-dp3"><h1><span>The </span><em>Paramatthamañjūsā</em></h1><p><span>The notes to this translation contain many quotations from the commentary to the </span><em>Visuddhimagga, </em><span>called the </span><em>Paramatthamañjūsā </em><span>or </span><em>Mahā-ṭīkā. </em><span>It is regarded as an authoritative work. The quotations are included both for the light they shed on difficult passages in the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>and for the sake of rendering for the first time some of the essays interspersed in it. The prologue and epilogue give its author as an elder named Dhammapāla, who lived at Badaratittha (identified as near Chennai). This author, himself also an Indian, is usually held to have lived within two centuries or so of Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa. There is nothing to say that he ever came to Sri Lanka.</span></p><p><span>The</span><em> Visuddhimagga </em><span>quotes freely from the Paṭisambhidāmagga, the commentary to which was written by an elder named Mahānāma (date in the Middle Period and place of residence uncertain). Mostly but not quite always, the Elder Dhammapāla says the same thing, when commenting on these quoted passages, as the Elder Mahānāma but in more words.</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>The Elder Dhammapāla, commenting on Vism </span><a href="#XXI.77">XXI.77</a><span>, takes the reading </span><em>phuṭṭhantaṃ sacchikato </em><span>and explains that (cf. </span><em>Mūla Ṭīkā</em><span>, Pug-ṭ 32), but the Elder Mahānāma, commenting on the Paṭisambhidāmagga from which the passage is quoted, takes the reading </span><em>phuṭṭhattā sacchikato </em><span>and comments differently (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis-a">Paṭis-a</a><span> 396</span></span><span>, Hewavitarne ed.). Again, what is referred to as “said by some </span><em>(keci)” </em><span>in the Elder Dhammapāla’s comment on the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>(see Vism VIII, n.46) is put forward by the Elder Mahānāma with no such reservation (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis-a">Paṭis-a</a><span> 351</span></span><span>). It is the usual standard of strict consistency that makes such very minor divergences noticeable. These two commentators, though, rarely reproduce each other </span><em>verbatim. </em><span>Contrastingly, where the </span><em>Paramatthamañjūsā </em><span>and the </span><em>Mūlaṭīkā </em><span>similarly overlap, the sentences are mostly </span><em>verbatim, </em><span>but the former, with extra material, looks like an expanded version of the latter, or the latter a cut version of the former.</span></span></span><span> He relies much on syllogisms and logical arguments. Also there are several discussions of some of the systems of the “Six Schools” of Brahmanical philosophy. There are no stories. This academic writer is difficult, formalistic, and often involved, very careful and accurate. Various other works are attributed to him.</span></p></section><section class="sect-dp3"><h1><span>Some Main Threads in the </span><em>Visuddhimagga</em></h1><p><span class="vism-page-bps">[50|xlviii]</span><span>The </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>is probably best regarded as a detailed manual for meditation masters, and as a work of reference. As to its rather intricate construction, the List of Contents is given rather fully in order to serve as a guide to the often complicated form of the chapters and to the work as a whole. In addition, the following considerations may be noted.</span></p><p><span>Chapters </span><a href="#I">I</a><span> and </span><a href="#II">II</a><span>, which deal with virtue as the practice of restraint, or withdrawal, need present no difficulties. It can be remarked here, though, that when the Buddhist ascetic goes into seclusion (restrains the sense doors), it would be incorrect to say of him that he “leaves the </span><em>world”; </em><span>for where a man is, there is his world </span><em>(loka),</em><span> as appears in the discourse quoted in </span><a href="#VII.36">VII.36</a><span> (cf. also </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> IV 116</span></span><span> as well as many other suttas on the same subject). So when he retreats from the clamour of society to the woods and rocks, he takes his world with him, as though withdrawing to his laboratory, in order to better analyze it.</span></p><p><span>Chapters </span><a href="#III">III</a><span> to </span><a href="#XI">XI</a><span> describe the process of concentration and give directions for attaining it by means of a choice of forty meditation subjects for developing concentration. The account of each single meditation subject as given here is incomplete unless taken in conjunction with the whole of </span><a href="#pIII">Part III</a><span> (Understanding), which applies to all. Concentration is training in intensity and depth of focus and in single-mindedness. While Buddhism makes no exclusive claim to teach jhāna concentration </span><em>(samatha = samādhi), </em><span>it does claim that the development of insight </span><em>(vipassanā) </em><span>culminating in penetration of the Four Noble Truths is peculiar to it. The two have to be coupled together in order to attain the Truths</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>See </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> II 56</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> II 92f.</span></span></span></span><span>and the end of suffering. Insight is initially training to see experience as it occurs, without misperception, invalid assumptions, or wrong inferences.</span></p><p><span>Chapters </span><a href="#XII">XII</a><span> and </span><a href="#XIII">XIII</a><span> describe the rewards of concentration fully developed without insight.</span></p><p><span>Chapters </span><a href="#XIV">XIV</a><span> to </span><a href="#XVII">XVII</a><span> on understanding are entirely </span><em>theoretical. </em><span>Experience in general is dissected, and the separated components are described and grouped in several alternative patterns in Chapters </span><a href="#XIV">XIV</a><span> to </span><a href="#XVI.1">XVI.1</a><span>–</span><a href="#XVI.12">12</a><span>. The rest of </span><a href="#XVI">Chapter XVI</a><span> expounds the Four Noble Truths, the centre of the Buddha’s teaching. After that, dependent origination, or the structure of conditionality, is dealt with in its aspect of </span><em>arising, </em><span>or the process of being (</span><a href="#XVII">Ch. XVII</a><span>; as </span><em>cessation, </em><span>or Nibbāna, it is dealt with separately in Chapters </span><a href="#XVI">XVI</a><span> and </span><a href="#XIX">XIX</a><span>). The formula of dependent origination in its varying modes describes the working economics of the first two truths (suffering as outcome of craving, and craving itself—see also </span><a href="#XVII.n48">Ch. XVII, n.48</a><span>). Without an understanding of conditionality the Buddha’s teaching cannot be grasped: “He who sees dependent origination sees the Dhamma” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 191</span></span><span>), though not all details in this work are always necessary. Since the detailed part of this chapter is very elaborate (</span><a href="#XVII.58">§58</a><span>–</span><a href="#XVII.272">272</a><span>), a first reading confined to </span><a href="#XVII.1">§1</a><span>–</span><a href="#XVII.6">6</a><span>, </span><a href="#XVII.20">§20</a><span>–</span><a href="#XVII.57">57</a><span>, and </span><a href="#XVII.273">§273</a><span>–</span><a href="#XVII.314">314</a><span>, might help to avoid losing the thread. These four chapters are “theoretical” because they contain in detailed form what needs to be learnt, if only in outline, as “book-learning” </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[51|xlix]</span><em>(sotāvadhāna-ñāṇa). </em><span>They furnish techniques for describing the total experience and the experienceable rather as the branches of arithmetic and double-entry bookkeeping are to be learned as techniques for keeping accurate business accounts.</span></p><p><span>Chapters </span><a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a><span> to </span><a href="#XXI">XXI</a><span>, on the contrary, are </span><em>practical </em><span>and give instructions for applying the book-knowledge learnt from Chapters </span><a href="#XIV">XIV</a><span> to </span><a href="#XVII">XVII</a><span> by analyzing in its terms the meditator’s individual experience, dealing also with what may be expected to happen in the course of development. </span><a href="#XVIII">Chapter XVIII</a><span> as “defining of mentality-materiality” (first application of Chapters </span><a href="#XIV">XIV</a><span> to </span><a href="#XVI">XVI</a><span>) and Chapter </span><a href="#XIX">XIX</a><span> as “discerning conditions” (first application of Chapter XVII) are preparatory to insight proper, which begins in Chapter </span><a href="#XX">XX</a><span> with contemplation of rise and fall. After this, progress continues through the “eight knowledges” with successive clarification—clarification of view of the object and consequent alterations of subjective attitude towards it—till a point, called “conformity knowledge,” is reached which, through one of the “three gateways to liberation,” heralds the attainment of the first supramundane path.</span></p><p><span>In </span><a href="#XXII">Chapter XXII</a><span>, the attainment of the four successive supramundane paths (or successive stages in realization) is described, with the first of which Nibbāna (extinction of the craving which originates suffering) is ‘seen’ for the first time, having till then been only intellectually conceived. At that moment suffering as a noble truth is fully understood, craving, its origin, is abandoned, suffering’s cessation is realized, and the way to its cessation is developed.</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>In the present work the development of serenity (concentration) is carried to its limit before insight (understanding) is dealt with. This is for clarity. But in the commentary to the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (DN 22, MN 10) either the two are developed contemporaneously or insight is allowed to precede jhāna concentration. According to the Suttas, concentration of jhāna strength is necessary for the manifestation of the path (see e.g. </span><a href="#XIV.127">XIV.127</a><span>; </span><a href="#XV.n7">XV, n.7</a><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D">D</a><span> II 313</span></span><span> = </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> III 252</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> II 156</span></span><span>, quoted at </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> II 92f.</span></span><span>).</span></span></span><span> The three remaining paths develop further and complete that vision.</span></p><p><span>Finally, </span><a href="#XXIII">Chapter XXIII</a><span>, as the counterpart of Chapters </span><a href="#XII">XII</a><span> and </span><a href="#XIII">XIII</a><span>, describes the benefits of understanding.

But when he ventures upon rendering an Oriental language, he will often have to be his own guide.</span></p><p><span>Naturally, a translator from Pali today owes a large debt to his predecessors and to the Pali Text Society’s publications, including in particular the Society’s invaluable </span><em>Pali-English Dictionary</em><span>. A translator of the </span><em>Visuddhimagga, </em><span>too, must make due acknowledgement of its pioneer translation</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>Reprinted by the Pali Text Society as </span><em>Path of Purity,</em><span> 1922–31.</span></span></span><span> U Pe Maung Tin. </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[52|l]</span><span>The word </span><em>pāḷi </em><span>is translatable by “text.” The </span><em>pāḷi </em><span>language (the “text language,” which the commentators call Magadhan) holds a special position, with no European parallel, being reserved to one field, namely, the Buddha’s teaching. So there are no alien echoes. In the Suttas, the Sanskrit is silent, and it is heavily muted in the later literature. This fact, coupled with the richness and integrity of the subject itself, gives it a singular limpidness and depth in its early form, as in a string quartet or the clear ocean, which attains in the style of the Suttas to an exquisite and unrivalled beauty unreflectable by any rendering. Traces seem to linger even in the intricate formalism preferred by the commentators.</span></p><p><span>This translation presents many formidable problems. Mainly either epistemological and psychological, or else linguistic, they relate either to what ideas and things are being discussed, or else to the manipulation of dictionary meanings of words used in discussion.</span></p><p><span>The first is perhaps dominant. As mentioned earlier, the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>can be properly studied only as part of the whole commentarial edifice, whose cornerstone it is. But while indexes of words and subjects to the PTS edition of the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>exist, most of its author’s works have only indexes of Piṭaka words and names commented on but none for the mass of subject matter. So the student has to make his own. Of the commentaries too, only the </span><em>Atthasālinī, </em><span>the Dhammapada Commentary, and the Jātaka Commentary have so far been translated (and the latter two are rather in a separate class). But that is a minor aspect.</span></p><p><span>This book is largely technical and presents all the difficulties peculiar to technical translation: it deals, besides, with mental happenings. Now where many synonyms are used, as they often are in Pali, for public material objects—an elephant, say, or gold or the sun—the “material objects” should be pointable to, if there is doubt about what is referred to. Again even such generally recognized private experiences as those referred to by the words “consciousness” or “pain” seem too obvious to introspection for uncertainty to arise (communication to fail) if they are given variant symbols. Here the English translator can forsake the Pali allotment of synonyms and indulge a liking for “elegant variation,” if he has it, without fear of muddle. But mind is fluid, as it were, and materially negative, and its analysis needs a different and a strict treatment. In the Suttas, and still more in the Abhidhamma, charting by analysis and definition of pin-pointed mental states is carried far into unfamiliar waters. It was already recognized then that this is no more a solid landscape of “things” to be pointed to when variation has resulted in vagueness. As an instance of disregard of this fact: a greater scholar with impeccable historical and philological judgment (perhaps the most eminent of the English translators) has in a single work rendered the </span><em>cattāro satipaṭṭhāna </em><span>(here represented by “four foundations of mindfulness”) by “four inceptions of deliberation,” “fourfold setting up of mindfulness,” “fourfold setting up of starting,” “four applications of mindfulness,” and other variants. The PED foreword observes: “No one needs now to use the one English word ‘desire’ as a translation of sixteen distinct Pali words, no one of which means precisely desire. Yet this was done in Vol. X of the</span><em> Sacred Books of the East</em><span> by Max Müller and Fausböll.” True; but need one go to the other extreme? How without looking up the Pali can one be sure if the same idea is </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[53|li]</span><span>referred to by all these variants and not some other such as those referred to by </span><em>cattāro iddhipādā (“</em><span>four roads to power” or “bases of success”), </span><em>cattāro sammappadhānā </em><span>(“four right endeavours”), etc., or one of the many other “fours”? It is customary not to vary, say, the “call for the categorical imperative” in a new context by some such alternative as “uncompromising order” or “plain-speaking bidding” or “call for unconditional surrender,” which the dictionaries would justify, or “faith” which the exegetists might recommend; that is to say, if it is hoped to avoid confusion. The choosing of an adequate rendering is, however, a quite different problem.</span></p><p><span>But there is something more to be considered before coming to that. So far only the difficulty of isolating, symbolizing, and describing individual mental states has been touched on. But here the whole mental structure with its temporal-dynamic process is dealt with too. Identified mental as well as material states (none of which can arise independently) must be recognizable with their associations when encountered in new circumstances: for here arises the central question of thought-association and its manipulation. That is tacitly recognized in the Pali. If disregarded in the English rendering the tenuous structure with its inferences and negations—the flexible pattern of thought-associations—can no longer be communicated or followed, because the pattern of speech no longer reflects it, and whatever may be communicated is only fragmentary and perhaps deceptive. Renderings of words have to be distinguished, too, from renderings of words used to explain those words. From this aspect the Oriental system of word-by-word translation, which transliterates the sound of the principal substantive and verb stems and attaches to them local inflections, has much to recommend it, though, of course, it is not readable as “literature.” One is handling instead of pictures of isolated ideas or even groups of ideas a whole coherent chart system. And besides, words, like maps and charts, are conventionally used to represent high dimensions.</span></p><p><span>When already identified states or currents are encountered from new angles, the new situation can be verbalized in one of two ways at least: either by using in a new appropriate verbal setting the words already allotted to these states, or by describing the whole situation afresh in different terminology chosen </span><em>ad hoc. </em><span>While the second may gain in individual brightness, connections with other allied references can hardly fail to be lost. Aerial photographs must be taken from consistent altitudes, if they are to be used for making maps. And words serve the double purpose of recording ideas already formed and of arousing new ones.</span></p><p><span>Structural coherence between different parts in the Pali of the present work needs reflecting in the translation—especially in the last ten chapters—if the thread is not soon to be lost. In fact, in the Pali (just as much in the Tipiṭaka as in its Commentaries), when such subjects are being handled, one finds that a tacit rule, “One term and one flexible definition for one idea (or state or event or situation) referred to,” is adhered to pretty thoroughly. The reason has already been made clear. With no such rule, ideas are apt to disintegrate or coalesce or fictitiously multiply (and, of course, any serious attempt at indexing in English is stultified). </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[54|lii]</span><span>One thing needs to be made clear, though; for there is confusion of thought on this whole subject (one so far only partly investigated).</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>See Prof. I. A. Richards, </span><em>Mencius on Mind,</em><span> Kegan Paul, 1932.</span></span></span><span>This “rule of parsimony in variants” has nothing to do with mechanical transliteration, which is a translator’s refuge when he is unsure of himself. The guiding rule, “One recognizable idea, one word, or phrase to symbolize it,” in no sense implies any such rule as, “One Pali word, one English word,” which is neither desirable nor practicable. Nor in translating need the rule apply beyond the scope reviewed.</span></p><p><span>So much for the epistemological and psychological problems.</span></p><p><span>The linguistic problem is scarcely less formidable though much better recognized. While English is extremely analytic, Pali (another Indo-European language) is one of the groups of tongues regarded as dominated by Sanskrit, strongly agglutinative, forming long compounds and heavily inflected. The vocabulary chosen occasioned much heart-searching but is still very imperfect. If a few of the words encountered seem a bit algebraical at first, contexts and definitions should make them clear. In the translation of an Oriental language, especially a classical one, the translator must recognize that such knowledge which the Oriental reader is taken for granted to possess is lacking in his European counterpart, who tends unawares to fill the gaps from his own foreign store: the result can be like taking two pictures on one film. Not only is the common background evoked by the words shadowy and patchy, but European thought and Indian thought tend to approach the problems of human existence from opposite directions. This affects word formations. And so double meanings (utraquisms, puns, and metaphors) and etymological links often follow quite different tracks, a fact which is particularly intrusive in describing mental events, where the terms employed are mainly “material” ones used metaphorically. Unwanted contexts constantly creep in and wanted ones stay out. Then there are no well-defined techniques for recognizing and handling idioms, literal rendering of which misleads (while, say, one may not wonder whether to render </span><em>tour de force </em><span>by “enforced tour” or “tower of strength,” one cannot always be so confident in Pali).</span></p><p><span>Then again in the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>alone the actual words and word-meanings not in the PED come to more than two hundred and forty. The PED, as its preface states, is “essentially preliminary”; for when it was published many books had still not been collated; it leaves out many words even from the Sutta Piṭaka, and the Sub-commentaries are not touched by it. Also—and most important here—in the making of that dictionary the study of Pali literature had for the most part not been tackled much from, shall one say, the philosophical, or better, epistemological, angle,</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>Exceptions are certain early works of Mrs. C.A.F. Rhys Davids. See also discussions in appendixes to the translations of the Kathāvatthu (</span><em>Points of Controversy</em><span>, PTS) and the </span><em>Abhidhammatthasaṅgaha</em><span> (</span><em>Compendium of Philosophy</em><span>, PTS).</span></span></span><span>work and interest having been concentrated till then almost exclusively on history and philology. For instance, the epistemologically unimportant word </span><em>vimāna </em><span>(divine mansion) is given more than twice the space allotted to the term </span><em>paṭicca-samuppāda </em><span>(dependent origination), a difficult subject of central importance, the article on which is altogether inadequate and misleading (owing partly to misapplication of the “historical method”). Then </span><em>gala </em><span>(throat) has been found more </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[55|liii]</span><span>glossarialy interesting than </span><em>paṭisandhi </em><span>(rebirth-linking), the original use of which word at </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> III 230</span></span><span> is ignored. Under </span><em>nāma, </em><span>too, </span><em>nāma-rūpa</em><span> is confused with </span><em>nāma-kāya. </em><span>And so one might continue. By this, however, it is not intended at all to depreciate that great dictionary, but only to observe that in using it the Pali student has sometimes to be wary: if it is criticized in particular here (and it can well hold its own against criticism), tribute must also be paid to its own inestimable general value.</span></p></section><section class="sect-dp3"><h1><span>Concluding remarks</span></h1><p><span>Current standard English has been aimed at and preference given always to simplicity. This has often necessitated cutting up long involved sentences, omitting connecting particles (such as </span><em>pana, pan’ettha, yasmā </em><span>when followed by </span><em>tasmā, hi, kho, </em><span>etc.), which serve simply as grammatical grease in long chains of subordinate periods. Conversely the author is sometimes extraordinarily elliptic (as in </span><a href="#XIV.46">XIV.46</a><span> and </span><a href="#XVI.68">XVI.68f.</a><span>), and then the device of square brackets has been used to add supplementary matter, without which the sentence would be too enigmatically shorthand. Such additions (kept to the minimum) are in almost every case taken from elsewhere in the work itself or from the </span><em>Paramatthamañjūsā. </em><span>Round brackets have been reserved for references and for alternative renderings (as, e.g., in </span><a href="#I.140">I.140</a><span>) where there is a sense too wide for any appropriate English word to straddle.</span></p><p><span>A few words have been left untranslated (see individual notes). The choice is necessarily arbitrary. It includes </span><em>kamma, dhamma</em><span> (sometimes), </span><em>jhāna, Buddha </em><span>(sometimes), </span><em>bhikkhu, Nibbāna, Pātimokkha, kasiṇa, Piṭaka</em><span>, and </span><em>arahant</em><span>. There seemed no advantage and much disadvantage in using the Sanskrit forms, </span><em>bhikṣu, dharma, dhyāna, arhat, </em><span>etc., as is sometimes done (even though ”karma” and “nirvana” are in the </span><em>Concise Oxford Dictionary</em><span>), and no reason against absorbing the Pali words into English as they are by dropping the diacritical marks. Proper names appear in their Pali spelling without italics and with diacritical marks. Wherever Pali words or names appear, the stem form has been used (e.g. </span><em>Buddha, kamma) </em><span>rather than the inflected nominative </span><em>(Buddho, kammaṃ), </em><span>unless there were reasons against it.</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>Pronounce letters as follows: </span><em>a</em><span> as in countryman, </span><em>ā</em><span> father, </span><em>e</em><span> whey, </span><em>i</em><span> chin, </span><em>ī</em><span> machine, </span><em>u</em><span> full, </span><em>ū </em><span>rule; c church (always), </span><em>g</em><span> give (always); </span><em>h</em><span> always sounded separately, e.g. </span><em>bh</em><span> in cab-horse, </span><em>ch</em><span> in catch him (not kitchen), </span><em>ph</em><span> in upholstery (not telephone), </span><em>th</em><span> in hot-house (not pathos), etc.; </span><em>j</em><span> joke; </span><em>ṃ</em><span> and </span><em>ṅ</em><span> as ng in singer, </span><em>ñ</em><span> as </span><em>ni</em><span> in onion; </span><em>ḍ, ḷ, ṇ</em><span> and </span><em>ṭ</em><span> are pronounced with tongue-tip on palate; </span><em>d, t, n</em><span> and with tongue-tip on teeth; double consonants as in Italian, e.g. </span><em>dd</em><span> as in mad dog (not madder), </span><em>gg</em><span> as in big gun (not bigger); rest as in English.</span></span></span></p><p><span>Accepted renderings have not been departed from nor earlier translators gone against capriciously. It seemed advisable to treat certain emotionally charged words such as “real” (especially with a capital R) with caution. Certain other words have been avoided altogether. For example, </span><em>vassa </em><span>(“rains”) signifies a three-month period of residence in one place during the rainy season, enjoined upon bhikkhus by the Buddha in order that they should not travel about trampling down crops and so </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[56|liv]</span><span>annoy farmers. To translate it by “lent” as is sometimes done lets in a historical background and religious atmosphere of mourning and fasting quite alien to it (with no etymological support). “Metempsychosis” for </span><em>paṭisandhi </em><span>is another notable instance.</span><span class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>Of the principal English value words, “real,” “truth,” “beauty,” “good,” “absolute,” “being,” etc.: “real” has been used for </span><em>tatha</em><span> (</span><a href="#XVI.24">XVI.24</a><span>), “truth” allotted to </span><em>sacca</em><span> (</span><a href="#XVI.25">XVI.25</a><span>) and “beauty” to </span><em>subha</em><span> (</span><a href="#IX.119">IX.119</a><span>); “good” has been used sometimes for the prefix </span><em>su-</em><span> and also for the adj. </span><em>kalyāṇa </em><span>and the subst. </span><em>attha.</em><span> “Absolute” has not been employed, though it might perhaps be used for the word </span><em>advaya,</em><span> which qualifies the word </span><em>kasiṇa </em><span>(“universality,” “totalization”) at </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> II 14</span></span><span>, and then: “One (man) perceives earth as a universality above, below, around, absolute, measureless” could be an alternative for the rendering given in </span><a href="#V.38">V.38</a><span>. “Being” (as abstract subst.) has sometimes been used for </span><em>bhava,</em><span> which is otherwise rendered by “becoming.”</span></span></span></p><p><span>The handling of three words, </span><em>dhamma, citta, </em><span>and </span><em>rūpa </em><span>(see Glossary and relevant notes) is admittedly something of a makeshift. The only English word that might with some agility be used consistently for </span><em>dhamma </em><span>seems to be “idea”; but it has been crippled by philosophers and would perhaps mislead. </span><em>Citta </em><span>might with advantage have been rendered throughout by “cognizance,” in order to preserve its independence, instead of rendering it sometimes by “mind” (shared with </span><em>mano) </em><span>and sometimes by “consciousness” (shared with </span><em>viññāṇa) </em><span>as has been done. But in many contexts all three Pali words are synonyms for the same general notion (see </span><a href="#XIV.82">XIV.82</a><span>); and technically, the notion of “cognition,” referred to in its bare aspect by </span><em>viññāṇa, </em><span>is also referred to along with its concomitant affective colouring, thought and memory, etc., by </span><em>citta. </em><span>So the treatment accorded to </span><em>citta </em><span>here finds support to that extent. Lastly “mentality-materiality” for </span><em>nāma-rūpa</em><span> is inadequate and “name-and-form” in some ways preferable. “Name” (see </span><a href="#XVIII.n4">Ch. XVIII, n.4</a><span>) still suggests </span><em>nāma’s </em><span>function of “naming”; and “form” for the </span><em>rūpa </em><span>of the </span><em>rūpakkhandha </em><span>(“materiality aggregate”) can preserve the link with the </span><em>rūpa </em><span>of the </span><em>rūpāyatana, </em><span>(“visible-object base”) by rendering them respectively with “material form aggregate” and “visible form base”—a point not without philosophical importance. A compromise has been made at Chapter </span><a href="#X.13">X.13</a><span>. “Materiality” or “matter” wherever used should not be taken as implying any hypostasis, any “permanent or semi-permanent substance behind appearances” (the objective counterpart of the subjective ego), which would find no support in the Pali.</span></p><p><span>The editions of Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand have been consulted as well as the two Latin-script editions; and Sinhalese translations, besides. The paragraph numbers of the Harvard University Press edition will be found at the start of paragraphs and the page numbers of the Pali Text Society’s edition in square brackets in the text (the latter, though sometimes appearing at the end of paragraphs, mark the beginnings of the PTS pages). Errors of readings and punctuation in the PTS edition not in the Harvard edition have not been referred to in the notes.</span></p><p><span>For the quotations from the Tipiṭaka it was found impossible to make use of existing published translations because they lacked the kind of treatment sought. However, other translation work in hand served as the basis for all the Piṭaka quotations.</span></p><p><span>Rhymes seemed unsuitable for the verses from the Tipiṭaka and the “Ancients”; but they have been resorted to for the summarizing verses belonging to the </span><em>Visuddhimagga </em><span>itself. The English language is too weak in fixed stresses to lend </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[57|lv]</span><span>itself to Pali rhythms, though one attempt to reproduce them was made in </span><a href="#IV">Chapter IV</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Where a passage from a sutta is commented on, the order of the explanatory comments follows the Pali order of words in the original sentence, which is not always that of the translation of it.</span></p><p><span>In Indian books the titles and subtitles are placed only at, the end of the subject matter. In the translations they have been inserted at the beginning, and some subtitles added for the sake of clarity. In this connection the title at the end of </span><a href="#XI">Chapter XI</a><span>, “Description of Concentration” is a “heading” applying not only to that chapter but as far back as the beginning of </span><a href="#III">Chapter III</a><span>.

It is the initial stage of the path because it has actually to be purified in the prior stage too. Hence it is said: “But his bodily action, his verbal action, and his livelihood have already been purified earlier” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> III 289</span></span><span>).

But the Ancients (</span><em>porāṇā</em><span>) said: “The eye does not see a visible object because it has no mind. The mind does not see because it has no eyes. But when there is the impingement of door and object he sees by means of the consciousness that has eye-sensitivity as its physical basis. Now, (an idiom) such as this is called an ‘accessory locution’ (</span><em>sasambhārakathā</em><span>), like ‘He shot him with his bow,’ and so on. So the meaning here is this: ‘On seeing a visible object with eye-consciousness.’”</span><span id="I.n14" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“‘</span><em>On seeing a visible object with the eye</em><span>”: if the eye were to see the visible object, then (organs) belonging to other kinds of consciousness would see too; but that is not so. Why? Because the eye has no thought (</span><em>acetanattā</em><span>). And then, were consciousness itself to see a visible object, it would see it even behind a wall because of being independent of sense resistance (</span><em>appaṭighabhāvato</em><span>); but that is not so either because there is no seeing in all kinds of consciousness. And herein, it is consciousness dependent on the eye that sees, not just any kind. And that does not arise with respect to what is enclosed by walls, etc., where light is excluded. But where there is no exclusion of light, as in the case of a crystal or a mass of cloud, there it does arise even with respect to what is enclosed by them. So it is as a basis of consciousness that the eye sees.</span></span><span class="p"><span>“‘</span><em>When there is the impingement of door and object</em><span>’: what is intended is: when a visible datum as object has come into the eye’s focus. ‘</span><em>One sees</em><span>’: one looks (</span><em>oloketi</em><span>); for when the consciousness that has eye-sensitivity as its material support is disclosing (</span><em>obhāsente</em><span>) by means of the special quality of its support a visible datum as object that is assisted by light (</span><em>āloka</em><span>), then it is said that a person possessed of that sees the visible datum. And here the illuminating is the revealing of the visible datum according to its individual essence, in other words, the apprehending of it experientially (</span><em>paccakkhato</em><span>).</span></span><span class="p"><span>“Here it is the ‘</span><em>sign of woman</em><span>’ because it is the cause of perceiving as ‘woman’ all such things as the shape that is grasped under the heading of the visible data (materiality) invariably found in a female continuity, the un-clear-cut-ness (</span><em>avisadatā</em><span>) of the flesh of the breasts, the beardlessness of the face, the use of cloth to bind the hair, the un-clear-cut stance, walk, and so on. The ‘</span><em>sign of man</em><span>’ is in the opposite sense.</span></span><span class="p"><span>“‘</span><em>The sign of beauty</em><span>’ here is the aspect of woman that is the cause for the arising of lust. By the word ‘etc.’ the sign of resentment (</span><em>paṭigha</em><span>), etc., are included, which should be understood as the undesired aspect that is the cause for the arising of hate. And here admittedly only covetousness and grief are specified in the text but the sign of equanimity needs to be included too; since there is non-restraint in the delusion that arises due to overlooking, or since ‘forgetfulness of unknowing’ is said below (§57). And here the ‘sign of equanimity’ should be understood as an object that is the basis for the kind of equanimity associated with unknowing through overlooking it. So ‘</span><em>the sign of beauty</em><span>, etc.’ given in brief thus is actually the cause of greed, hate, and delusion. “‘</span><em>He stops at what is merely seen</em><span>’: according to the Sutta method, ‘The seen shall be merely seen’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Ud">Ud</a><span> 8</span></span><span>).

After that, eye-consciousness with the function of seeing; after that, resultant mind-element with the function of receiving; after that, resultant root-causeless mind-consciousness-element with the function of investigating; after that, functional root-causeless mind-consciousness-element accomplishing the function of determining arises and ceases.

Or alternatively, there is that which is called ‘old feelings’ because, being conditioned by former kamma, it arises now in dependence on unsuitable immoderate eating—I shall put a stop to that old feeling, forestalling its condition by suitable moderate eating. And there is that which is called ‘new feeling’ because it will arise in the future in dependence on the accumulation of kamma consisting in making improper use [of the requisite of alms food] now—I shall also not arouse that new feeling, avoiding by means of proper use the production of its root.” This is how the meaning should be understood here.

Of course, the warding off of the perils of climate is stated by [the phrase] “protection from cold,” etc., too; but, just as in the case of making use of the robes the concealment of the private parts is stated as an invariable purpose while the others are periodical [purposes], so here also this [last] should be understood as mentioned with reference to the invariable warding off of the perils of climate.

Herein, evident perils are lions, tigers, etc., while concealed perils are greed, hate, and so on. When a bhikkhu knows and reflects thus in making use of the kind of resting place where these [perils] do not, owing to unguarded doors and sight of unsuitable visible objects, etc., cause affliction, he can be understood as one who “reflecting wisely makes use of the resting place for the purpose of warding off the perils of climate.”</span></p><p id="I.96" class="vism-para"><strong>§96. </strong><em>The requisite of medicine as cure for the sick</em><span>: here “cure” (</span><em>paccaya = </em><span>going against) is in the sense of going against (</span><em>pati-ayana</em><span>) illness; in the sense of countering, is the meaning. This is a term for any suitable remedy. It is the medical man’s work (</span><em>bhisakkassa kammaṃ</em><span>) because it is permitted by him, thus it is medicine (</span><em>bhesajja</em><span>).

For that is accomplished by understanding, because one who possesses understanding is able to see the advantages and the dangers in requisites. So one should abandon greed for requisites and undertake that virtue by using requisites obtained lawfully and properly, after reviewing them with understanding in the way aforesaid.</span></p><p id="I.124" class="vism-para"><strong>§124. </strong><span>Herein, reviewing is of two kinds: at the time of receiving requisites and at the time of using them.

There are four kinds of use: use as theft,</span><span id="I.n34" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“‘</span><em>Use as theft</em><span>’: use by one who is unworthy. And the requisites are allowed by the Blessed One to one in his own dispensation who is virtuous, not unvirtuous; and the generosity of the givers is towards one who is virtuous, not towards one who is not, since they expect great fruit from their actions” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 61</span></span><span>; cf. MN 142 and commentary).</span></span></span><span> use as a debt?, use as an inheritance, use as a master. Herein, use by one who is unvirtuous and makes use [of requisites], even sitting in the midst of the Community, is called “use as theft.” Use without reviewing by one who is virtuous is “use as a debt”; therefore the robe should be reviewed every time it is used, and the alms food lump by lump. One who cannot do this [should review it] before the meal, after the meal, in the first watch, in the middle watch, and in the last watch. If dawn breaks on him without his having reviewed it, he finds himself in the position of one who has used it as a debt. Also the resting place should be reviewed each time it is used. Recourse to mindfulness both in the accepting and the use of medicine is proper; but while this is so, though there is an offence for one who uses it without mindfulness after mindful acceptance, there is no offence for one who is mindful in using after accepting without mindfulness.</span></p><p id="I.126" class="vism-para"><strong>§126. </strong><span>Purification is of four kinds: purification by the Teaching, purification by restraint, purification by search, and purification by reviewing. Herein, </span><em>virtue of </em><span class="vism-page-bps">[100|42]</span><em>the Pātimokkha restraint </em><span>is called “purification by the Teaching”; </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(44)</span><span> for that is so called because it purifies by means of teaching. </span><em>Virtue of restraint of faculties </em><span>is called “purification by restraint”; for that is so called because it purifies by means of the restraint in the mental resolution, “I shall not do so again.” </span><em>Virtue of livelihood purification </em><span>is called “purification by search”; for that is so called because search is purified in one who abandons wrong search and gets requisites lawfully and properly. </span><em>Virtue dependent on requisites </em><span>is called “purification by reviewing”; for that is so called because it purifies by the reviewing of the kind already described. Hence it was said above (</span><a href="#I.125">§125</a><span>): “There is no offence for one who is mindful in using after accepting without mindfulness.”</span></p><p id="I.127" class="vism-para"><strong>§127. </strong><span>Use of the requisites by the seven kinds of trainers is called “use as an inheritance”; for they are the Buddha’s sons, therefore they make use of the requisites as the heirs of requisites belonging to their father. But how then, is it the Blessed One’s requisites or the laity’s requisites that are used? Although given by the laity, they actually belong to the Blessed One, because it is by the Blessed One that they are permitted. That is why it should be understood that the Blessed One’s requisites are used. The confirmation here is in the Dhammadāyāda Sutta (MN 3).</span></p><p><span>Use by those whose cankers are destroyed is called “use as a master”; for they make use of them as masters because they have escaped the slavery of craving.</span></p><p id="I.128" class="vism-para"><strong>§128. </strong><span>As regards these kinds of use, use as a master and use as an inheritance are allowable for all. Use as a debt is not allowable, to say nothing of use as theft. But this use of what is reviewed by one who is virtuous is use freed from debt because it is the opposite of use as a debt or is included in use as an inheritance too. For one possessed of virtue is called a trainer too because of possessing this training.</span></p><p id="I.129" class="vism-para"><strong>§129. </strong><span>As regards these three kinds of use, since use as a master is best, when a bhikkhu undertakes </span><em>virtue dependent on requisites</em><span>, he should aspire to that and use them after reviewing them in the way described.

It is “refuse” (</span><em>paṃsukūla</em><span>) since, owing to its being found on refuse in any such place as a street, a charnel ground, or a midden, it belongs, as it were, to the refuse in the sense of being dumped in anyone of these places. Or alternatively: like refuse it gets to a vile state (</span><em>PAṂSU viya KUcchitabhāvaṃ ULAti</em><span>), thus it is “refuse” (</span><em>paṃsukūla</em><span>); it goes to a vile state, is what is meant. The wearing of a refuse-[rag], which has acquired its derivative name</span><span id="II.n1" class="footnote"><span class="p"><em>Nibbacana—”</em><span>derivative name (or verbal derivative)”; gram. term not in PED; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> I 61</span></span><span>,105; Vism </span><a href="#XVI.16">XVI.16</a><span>.</span></span></span><span> in this way, is “refuse-[rag-wearing]” (</span><em>paṃsukūla</em><span>). That is his habit, thus he is a “refuse-[rag-wear-]er” (</span><em>paṃsukūlika</em><span>). The practice (</span><em>aṅga</em><span>) of the refuse-[rag-wear-]er is the “refuse-[rag-wear-]er’s practice” (</span><em>paṃsukūlikaṅga</em><span>). It is the action that is called the “practice.” Therefore it should be understood as a term for that by undertaking which one becomes a refuse-[rag-wear-]er.</span></p><p><span>ii. In the same way, he has the habit of [wearing] the triple robe (</span><em>ti-cīvara</em><span>)—in other words, the cloak of patches, the upper garment, and the inner clothing—thus he is a “triple-robe-[wear-]er” (</span><em>tecīvarika</em><span>). His practice is called the “triple-robe-wearer’s practice.”</span></p><p id="II.5" class="vism-para"><strong>§5. </strong><span>iii. The dropping (</span><em>pāta</em><span>) of the lumps (</span><em>piṇḍa</em><span>) of material sustenance (</span><em>āmisa</em><span>) called alms (</span><em>bhikkhā</em><span>) is “alms food” (</span><em>piṇḍapāta</em><span>); the falling (</span><em>nipatana</em><span>) into the bowl of lumps (</span><em>piṇḍa</em><span>) given by others, is what is meant. He gleans that alms food (that falling of lumps), he seeks it by approaching such and such a family, thus he is called an “alms-food [eat-]er” (</span><em>piṇḍapātika</em><span>). Or his vow is to gather (</span><em>patituṃ</em><span>)</span><span id="II.n2" class="footnote"><span class="p"><em>Patati—”</em><span>to gather (or to wander)”: not in PED.</span></span></span><span> the lump (</span><em>piṇḍa</em><span>), thus he is a “lump-gatherer” (</span><em>piṇḍapātin</em><span>). To “gather” is to wander for. A “lump-gatherer” (</span><em>piṇḍapātin</em><span>) is the same as an “alms-food-eater” (</span><em>piṇḍapātika</em><span>). The practice of the alms-food-eater is the “alms-food-eater’s practice.”</span></p><p id="II.6" class="vism-para"><strong>§6. </strong><span>iv. It is a hiatus (</span><em>avakhaṇḍana</em><span>) that is called a “gap” (</span><em>dāna</em><span>).</span><span id="II.n3" class="footnote"><span class="p"><em>Avakhaṇḍana—</em><span>”hiatus” and </span><em>dāna—”</em><span>gap”: not in PED.</span></span></span><span> It is removed (</span><em>apeta</em><span>) from a gap, thus it is called “gapless” (</span><em>apadāna</em><span>); the meaning is, it is without hiatus. It is together with (</span><em>saha</em><span>) what is gapless (</span><em>apadāna</em><span>), thus it is “with the gapless” (</span><em>sapadāna</em><span>); devoid of hiatus—from house to house—is what is meant. His habit is to wander on what-is-with-the-gapless, thus he is a “gapless wanderer” (</span><em>sapadāna-cārin</em><span>). A gapless wanderer is the same as a “house-to-house-seeker” (</span><em>sapadāna-cārika</em><span>). His practice is the “house-to-house-seeker’s practice.”</span></p><p id="II.7" class="vism-para"><strong>§7. </strong><span>v.

Alms (</span><em>piṇḍa</em><span>) in one bowl (</span><em>patta</em><span>) only because of refusing a second vessel, is “bowl-alms” (</span><em>patta-piṇḍa</em><span>). Now, making “bowl alms” (</span><em>patta-piṇḍa</em><span>) the name for the taking of alms food in the bowl: bowl-alms-food is his habit, thus he is a “bowl-food-eater” (</span><em>pattapiṇḍika</em><span>).

Not a later-food-eater is a “no-later-food-[eat-]er” (</span><em>khalu-pacchābhattika</em><span>), [that is, a “later-food-refuser”].

His practice is the “any-bed-user’s practice.”</span></p><p><span>xiii.

Herein, a village abode is the village itself with its precincts. A “village” may consist of one cottage or several cottages, it may be enclosed by a wall or not, have human inhabitants or not, and it can also be a caravan that is inhabited for more than four months. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(72)</span><span> The “village precincts” cover the range of a stone thrown by a man of medium stature standing between the gate-posts of a walled village, if there are two gate-posts, as at Anurādhapura (cf. </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vin">Vin</a><span> III 46</span></span><span>). The Vinaya experts say that this [stone’s throw] is characterized as up to the place where a thrown stone falls, as, for instance, when young men exercise their arms and throw stones in order to show off their strength. But the Suttanta experts say that it is up to where one thrown to scare crows normally falls. In the case of an unwalled village, the house precinct is where the water falls when a woman standing in the door of the outermost house of all throws water from a basin. Within a stone’s throw of the kind already described from that point is the village. Within a second stone’s throw is the village precinct.</span></p><p id="II.49" class="vism-para"><strong>§49. </strong><span>“Forest,” according to the Vinaya method firstly, is described thus: “Except the village and its precincts, all is forest” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vin">Vin</a><span> III 46</span></span><span>). According to the Abhidhamma method it is described thus: “Having gone out beyond the boundary post, all that is forest” (Vibh 251; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> I 176</span></span><span>). But according to the Suttanta method its characteristic is this: “A forest abode is five hundred bow-lengths distant” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vin">Vin</a><span> IV 183</span></span><span>). That should be defined by measuring it with a strung instructor’s bow from the gate-post of a walled village, or from the range of the first stone’s throw from an unwalled one, up to the monastery wall.</span></p><p id="II.50" class="vism-para"><strong>§50. </strong><span>But if the monastery is not walled, it is said in the Vinaya commentaries, it should be measured by making the first dwelling of all the limit, or else the refectory or regular meeting place or Bodhi Tree or shrine, even if that is far from a dwelling [belonging to the monastery]. But in the Majjhima commentary it is said that, omitting the precincts of the monastery and the village, the distance to be measured is that between where the two stones fall. This is the measure here.</span></p><p id="II.51" class="vism-para"><strong>§51. </strong><span>Even if the village is close by and the sounds of men are audible to people in the monastery, still if it is not possible to go straight to it because of rocks, rivers, etc., in between, the five hundred bow-lengths can be reckoned by that road even if one has to go by boat. But anyone who blocks the path to the village here and there for the purpose of [lengthening it so as to be able to say that he is] taking up the practice is cheating the ascetic practice.</span></p><p id="II.52" class="vism-para"><strong>§52. </strong><span>If a forest-dwelling bhikkhu’s preceptor or teacher is ill and does not get what he needs in the forest, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(73)</span><span> he should take him to a village abode and attend him there.

No doubt they will give it when we go into the town.” Early in the morning they went into the town together.

So, although for three months he ate in the house of the mother who bore him, yet he never said ‘I am your son, you are my mother!’ Oh, admirable man!” Even mother and father are no impediment for one such as him, so how much less any other family that supports him.</span></p><p id="III.43" class="vism-para"><strong>§43. </strong><em>3. Gain </em><span>is the four requisites. How are they an impediment? Wherever a meritorious bhikkhu goes, people give him a large supply of requisites. With giving blessings to them and teaching them the Dhamma he gets no chance to do the ascetic’s duties. From sunrise till the first watch of the night he never breaks his association with people. Again, even at dawn, alms-food eaters fond of opulence come and say, “Venerable sir, such and such a man lay follower, woman lay follower, friend, friend’s daughter, wants to see you,” and being ready to go, he replies, “Take the bowl and robe, friend.” So he is always on the alert. Thus these requisites are an impediment for him. He should leave his group and wander by himself where he is not known. This is the way his impediment is severed.</span></p><p id="III.44" class="vism-para"><strong>§44. </strong><em>4. Class </em><span>is a class (group) of students of suttas or students of Abhidhamma. If with the group’s instruction and questioning he gets no opportunity for the ascetic’s duties, then that group is an impediment for him. He should sever that impediment in this way: if those bhikkhus have already acquired the main part and little still remains, he should finish that off and then go to the forest. If they have only acquired little and much still remains, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(94)</span><span> he should, without travelling more than a league, approach another instructor of a class within the radius of a league and say, “Help those venerable ones with instruction, etc.” If he does not find anyone in this way, he should take leave of the class, saying. “I have a task to see to, friends; go where it suits you,” and he should do his own work.</span></p><p id="III.45" class="vism-para"><strong>§45. </strong><em>5.

It should be severed in this way. If little remains it should be completed. If much remains, it should be handed over to the Community or to bhikkhus who are entrusted with the Community’s affairs, if it is a new building for the Community; or if it is for himself, it should be handed over to those whom he entrusts with his own affairs, but if these are not available, he should relinquish it to the Community and depart.</span></p><p id="III.46" class="vism-para"><strong>§46. </strong><span class="vism-page-bps">[149|91]</span><em>6.

So one in this position should apply himself to the ascetic’s duties after he has done the journey and transacted the business.</span></p><p id="III.47" class="vism-para"><strong>§47. </strong><em>7.

But the teacher from whom one takes the dependence, the teacher who gives one instruction, the pupil to whom one has given the dependence, the pupil to whom one is giving instruction, and those who have that same teacher as oneself, should be looked after as long as the dependence or the instruction has not been terminated.

If he has none, he should go in search of it as alms and give that. But in the case of brothers or sisters, one should only give them what is theirs. If they have none, then one should give one’s own temporarily and later get it back, but one should not complain if one does not get it back. It is not allowed either to make medicine for or to give it to a sister’s husband who is not related by blood; but one can give it to one’s sister saying, “Give it to your husband.” The same applies to one’s brother’s wife. But it is allowed to make it for their children since they are blood relatives.</span></p><p id="III.50" class="vism-para"><strong>§50. </strong><em>8. Affliction </em><span>is any kind of illness. It is an impediment when it is actually afflicting; therefore it should be severed by treatment with medicine. But if it is not cured after taking medicine for a few days, then the ascetic’s duties should be done after apostrophizing one’s person in this way: “I am not your slave, or your hireling. I have come to suffering through maintaining you through the beginningless round of rebirths.”</span></p><p id="III.51" class="vism-para"><strong>§51. </strong><em>9. Books </em><span>means responsibility for the scriptures. That is an impediment only for one who is constantly busy with recitations, etc., but not for others. Here are relevant stories. The Elder Revata, it seems, the Majjhima reciter, went to the Elder Revata, the dweller in Malaya (the Hill Country), and asked him for a meditation subject. The elder asked him, “How are you in the scriptures, friend?”—”I am studying the Majjhima [Nikāya], venerable sir.”—”The Majjhima is a hard responsibility, friend. When a man is still learning the First Fifty by heart, he is faced with the Middle Fifty; and when he is still learning that by heart, he is faced </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[150|92]</span><span>with the Last Fifty. How can you take up a meditation subject?”—”Venerable sir, when I have taken a meditation subject from you, I shall not look at the scriptures again.” He took the meditation subject, and doing no recitation for nineteen years, he reached Arahantship in the twentieth year. He told bhikkhus who came for recitation: “I have not looked at the scriptures for twenty years, friends, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(96)</span><span> yet I am familiar with them. You may begin.” And from beginning to end he had no hesitation even over a single syllable.</span></p><p id="III.52" class="vism-para"><strong>§52. </strong><span>The Elder Mahā-Nāga, too, who lived at Karuliyagiri (Karaliyagiri) put aside the scriptures for eighteen years, and then he recited the Dhātukathā to the bhikkhus. When they checked this with the town-dwelling elders [of Anurādhapura], not a single question was found out of its order.</span></p><p id="III.53" class="vism-para"><strong>§53. </strong><span>In the Great Monastery too the Elder Tipiṭaka-Cūḷa-Abhaya had the golden drum struck, saying: “I shall expound the three Piṭakas in the circle of [experts in] the Five Collections of discourses,” and this was before he had learnt the commentaries. The Community of Bhikkhus said, “‘Which teachers’ teaching is it? Unless you give only the teaching of our own teachers we shall not let you speak.” Also his preceptor asked him when he went to wait on him, “Did you have the drum beaten, friend?”—”Yes, venerable sir.”—”For what reason?”—”I shall expound the scriptures, venerable sir.”—”Friend Abhaya, how do the teachers explain this passage?”—”They explain it in this way, venerable sir.” The elder dissented, saying “Hum.” Again three times, each time in a different way, he said, “They explain it in this way, venerable sir.” The elder always dissented, saying, “Hum.” Then he said, “Friend, your first explanation was the way of the teachers. But it is because you have not actually learnt it from the teachers’ lips that you are unable to maintain that the teachers say such and such. Go and learn it from our own teachers.”—”Where shall I go, venerable sir?”—”There is an elder named Mahā Dhammarakkhita living in the Tulādhārapabbata Monastery in the Rohaṇa country beyond the [Mahaveli] River. He knows all the scriptures. Go to him.” Saying, “Good, venerable sir,” he paid homage to the elder. He went with five hundred bhikkhus to the Elder Mahā-Dhammarakkhita, and when he had paid homage to him, he sat down. The elder asked, “Why have you come?”—”To hear the Dhamma, venerable sir.”—”Friend Abhaya, they ask me about the Dīgha and the Majjhima from time to time, but I have not looked at the others for thirty years. Still you may repeat them in my presence by night, and I shall explain them to you by day.” He said, “Good, venerable sir,” and he acted accordingly.</span></p><p id="III.54" class="vism-para"><strong>§54. </strong><span>The inhabitants of the village had a large pavilion built at the door of his dwelling, and they came daily to hear the Dhamma. Explaining by day what had been repeated by night, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(97)</span><span> the Elder [Dhammarakkhita] eventually completed the instruction. Then he sat down on a mat on the ground before the Elder Abhaya and said, “Friend, explain a meditation subject to me.”—”What are you saying, venerable sir, have I not heard it all from you? What can I explain to you that you do not already know?” The senior elder said, “This path is different for one who has actually travelled by.”</span></p><p id="III.55" class="vism-para"><strong>§55. </strong><span>The Elder Abhaya was then, it seems, a stream-enterer. When the Elder Abhaya had given his teacher a meditation subject, he returned to Anurādhapura. Later, </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[151|93]</span><span>while he was expounding the Dhamma in the Brazen Palace, he heard that the elder had attained Nibbāna. On hearing this, he said, “Bring me [my] robe, friends.” Then he put on the robe and said, “The Arahant path befits our teacher, friends. Our teacher was a true thoroughbred. He sat down on a mat before his own Dhamma pupil and said, ‘Explain a meditation subject to me.’ The Arahant path befits our teacher, friends.”</span></p><p><span>For such as these, books are no impediment.</span></p><p id="III.56" class="vism-para"><strong>§56. </strong><em>10.

Since that is so, while he is available only a meditation subject taken in the Blessed One’s presence is well taken.</span></p><p><span>But after his final attainment of Nibbāna, it is proper to take it from anyone of the eighty great disciples still living. When they are no more available, one who wants to take a particular meditation subject should take it from someone with cankers destroyed, who has, by means of that particular meditation subject, produced the fourfold and fivefold jhāna, and has reached the destruction of cankers by augmenting insight that had that jhāna as its proximate cause.</span></p><p id="III.63" class="vism-para"><strong>§63. </strong><span>But how then, does someone with cankers destroyed declare himself thus: “I am one whose cankers are destroyed?” Why not?

If not even one who knows one Piṭaka is available, then it should be taken from one who is familiar with one Collection together with its commentary and one who is himself conscientious. For a teacher such as this, who knows the texts, guards the heritage, and protects the tradition, will follow the teachers’ opinion rather than his own.

So a meditation subject should be taken by approaching the good friend such as this, the giver of a meditation subject, and by doing all the duties to him.</span></p><p id="III.66" class="vism-para"><strong>§66. </strong><span>If he is available in the same monastery, it is good.

When entering that monastery, he should do so [expecting nothing, and even provided] with a tooth-stick that he has had made allowable on the way [according to the rules].

When told, “Have some water to drink,” he can drink if he wants to. When told, “You may wash your feet,” he should not do so at once, for if the water has been brought by the teacher himself, it would be improper.

If he did not take it, it might make the teacher wonder, “Does this bhikkhu resent sharing so soon?” but having taken it, he should not anoint his feet at once. For if it were oil for anointing the teacher’s limbs, it would not be proper. So he should first anoint his head, then his shoulders, etc.; but when told, “This is meant for all the limbs, friend, anoint your feet,” he should put a little on his head and then anoint his feet. Then he should give it back, saying when the teacher takes it, “May I return this oil tube, venerable sir?”</span></p><p id="III.70" class="vism-para"><strong>§70. </strong><span>He should not say, “Explain a meditation subject to me, venerable sir” on the very day he arrives.

If he does not allow it when asked, they can be done when the opportunity offers. When he does them, three tooth-sticks should be brought, a small, a medium and a big one, and two kinds of mouth-washing water and bathing water, that is, hot and cold, should be set out. Whichever of these the teacher uses for three days should then be brought regularly. If the teacher uses either kind indiscriminately, he can bring whatever is available.</span></p><p id="III.71" class="vism-para"><strong>§71. </strong><span>Why so many words?

Herein, this is the right performance of duties. He should rise early; removing his sandals and arranging his robe on one shoulder, he should give the tooth-sticks and the mouth-washing water, and he should prepare the seat.

If he does not ask but agrees to the duties being done, then after ten days or a fortnight have gone by he should make an opportunity by staying back one day at the time of his dismissal, and announcing the reason for his coming; or he should go at an unaccustomed time, and when asked, “What have you come for?” he can announce it.</span></p><p id="III.73" class="vism-para"><strong>§73. </strong><span>If the teacher says, “Come in the morning,” he should do so. But if his stomach burns with a bile affliction at that hour, or if his food does not get digested owing to sluggish digestive heat, or if some other ailment afflicts him, he should let it be known, and proposing a time that suits himself, he should come at that time. For if a meditation subject is expounded at an inconvenient time, one cannot give attention.</span></p><p><span>This is the detailed explanation of the words “approach the good friend, the giver of a meditation subject.”</span></p><p/></section><section class="sect-dp4"><h1><span>Temperaments</span></h1><p id="III.74" class="vism-para"><strong>§74. </strong><span>Now, as to the words, </span><em>one that suits his temperament </em><span>(</span><a href="#III.28">§28</a><span>): there are six kinds of temperament, that is, greedy temperament, hating temperament, deluded temperament, faithful temperament, intelligent temperament, and speculative temperament. Some would have fourteen, taking these six single ones together with the four made up of the three double combinations and one triple combination with the greed triad and likewise with the faith triad. But if this classification is admitted, there are many more kinds of temperament possible by combining greed, etc., with faith, etc.; therefore the kinds of temperament should be understood briefly as only six. As to meaning the temperaments are one, that is to say, personal nature, idiosyncrasy. According to </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(102)</span><span> these there are only six types of persons, that is, one of greedy temperament, one of hating temperament, one of deluded temperament, one of faithful temperament, one of intelligent temperament, and one of speculative temperament.</span></p><p id="III.75" class="vism-para"><strong>§75. </strong><span>Herein, one of faithful temperament is parallel to one of greedy temperament because faith is strong when profitable [kamma] occurs in one of greedy </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[155|97]</span><span>temperament, owing to its special qualities being near to those of greed. For, in an unprofitable way, greed is affectionate and not over-austere, and so, in a profitable way, is faith.

For, in an unprofitable way, hate is disaffected and does not hold to its object, and so, in a profitable way, is understanding.

For just as in [the Emperor] Dhammāsoka’s time the </span><em>Karavīka </em><span>bird uttered a sweet song when it saw its own reflection in the looking glass walls all round and perceived </span><em>Karavīkas</em><span> in every direction,</span><span id="III.n30" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>The full story, which occurs at </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> III 382–383</span></span><span> and elsewhere, is this: “It seems that when the Karavīka bird has pecked a sweet-flavoured mango wth its beak and savoured the dripping juice, and flapping its wings, begins to sing, then quadrupeds caper as if mad. Quadrupeds grazing in their pastures drop the grass in their mouths and listen to the sound. Beasts of prey hunting small animals pause with one foot raised. Hunted animals lose their fear of death and halt in their tracks. Birds flying in the air stay with wings outstretched. Fishes in the water keep still, not moving their fins. All listen to the sound, so beautiful is the Karavīka’s song. Dhammāsoka’s queen Asandhamittā asked the Community: ‘Venerable sirs, is there anything that sounds like the Buddha?’—‘The Karavīka birds does.’—‘Where are those birds, venerable sirs?’—‘In the Himalaya.’</span></span><span class="p"><span>She told the king: ‘Sire, I wish to hear a Karavīka bird.’ The king dispatched a gold cage with the order, ‘Let a Karavīka bird come and sit in this cage.’ The cage travelled and halted in front of a Karavīka. Thinking, ‘The cage has come at the king’s command; it is impossible not to go,’ the bird got in. The cage returned and stopped before the king. They could not get the Karavīka to utter a sound. When the king asked, ‘When do they utter a sound?’ they replied, ‘On seeing their kin.’ Then the king had it surrounded with looking-glasses. Seeing its own reflection and imagining that its relatives had come, it flapped its wings and cried out with an exquisite voice as if sounding a crystal trumpet. All the people in the city rushed about as if mad. Asandhamittā thought: ‘If the sound of this creature is so fine, what indeed can the sound of the Blessed One have been like since he had reached the glory of omniscient knowledge?’ and arousing a happiness that she never again relinquished, she became established in the fruition of stream-entry.”</span></span></span><span> so the Elder [Siṅgāla Pitar] </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[165|107]</span><span>thought, when he saw the sign appearing in all directions through his acquisition of the perception of a skeleton, that the whole earth was covered with bones.</span></p><p id="III.112" class="vism-para"><strong>§112. </strong><span>If that is so, then is what is called “the measurelessness of the object of jhāna produced on foulness”</span><span id="III.n31" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>See </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhs">Dhs</a><span> 55</span></span><span>; but it comes under the “… </span><em>pe </em><span>…,” which must be filled in from pp. 37–38, §182 and §184.</span></span></span><span> contradicted? It is not contradicted. For one man apprehends the sign in a large bloated corpse or skeleton, another in a small one. In this way the jhāna of the one has a limited object and of the other a measureless object. Or alternatively, “With a measureless object” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhs">Dhs</a><span> 182–84</span></span><span> in elision) is said of it referring to one who extends it, seeing no disadvantage in doing so. But it need not be extended because no benefit results.</span></p><p id="III.113" class="vism-para"><strong>§113. </strong><span>The rest need not be extended likewise. Why? When a man extends the sign of in-breaths and out-breaths, only a quantity of wind is extended, and it has a definite location, [the nose-tip]. So it need not be extended because of the disadvantage and because of the definiteness of the location. And the divine abidings have living beings as their object. When a man extends the sign of these, only the quantity of living beings would be extended, and there is no purpose in that. So that also need not be extended.</span></p><p id="III.114" class="vism-para"><strong>§114. </strong><span>When it is said, “Intent upon one quarter with his heart endued with loving-kindness” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D">D</a><span> I 250</span></span><span>), etc., that is said for the sake of comprehensive inclusion. For it is when a man develops it progressively by including living beings in one direction by one house, by two houses, etc., that he is said to be “intent upon one direction,” </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(113)</span><span> not when he extends the sign.

The disappearance of consciousness need not be extended since it is mere non-existence of consciousness.

The three kinds, that is, the preliminary-work sign, learning sign and counterpart sign, do not appear in the Piṭakas.

The four divine abidings and four colour kasiṇas are eight suitable for one of hating temperament. Mindfulness of breathing is the one [recollection as a] meditation subject suitable for one of deluded temperament and for one of speculative temperament. The first six recollections are suitable for one of faithful temperament. Mindfulness of death, the recollection of peace, the defining of the four elements, and the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, are four suitable for one of intelligent temperament. The remaining kasiṇas and the immaterial states are suitable for all kinds of temperament.

With the inclination to non-greed, Bodhisattas see the fault in greed. With the inclination to non-hate, Bodhisattas see the fault in hate. With the inclination to non-delusion, Bodhisattas see the fault in delusion. With the inclination to renunciation, Bodhisattas see the fault in house life.

And in doing so, he can expound it in three ways: it can be expounded to one who has already learnt the meditation subject by having him recite it at one or two sessions; it can be expounded to one who lives in the same place each time he comes; and to one who wants to learn it and then go elsewhere it can be expounded in such a manner that it is neither too brief nor too long.</span></p><p id="III.131" class="vism-para"><strong>§131. </strong><span>Herein, when first he is explaining the earth kasiṇa, there are nine aspects that he should explain.

In that case, when he finds he is in doubt about, or has forgotten, some passage in the meditation subject, then he should do the duties in the monastery in good time and set out afterwards, going for alms on the way and arriving at the teacher’s dwelling place after his meal. He should make certain about the meditation subject that day in the teacher’s presence. Next day, after paying homage to the teacher, he should go for alms on his way back and so he can return to his own dwelling place without fatigue.

So if he thinks, “I shall go to the alms-resort village for alms” and takes his bowl and robe and sets out, perhaps he sees that the duties have not been done or that a drinking-water pot is empty, and so the duty has to be done by him unexpectedly. Drinking water must be maintained. By not doing it he would commit a </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[172|114]</span><span>wrongdoing in the breach of a duty. But if he does it, he loses time. He arrives too late at the village and gets nothing because the alms giving is finished. Also, when he goes into retreat, he is distracted by the loud noises of novices and young bhikkhus, and by acts of the Community [being carried out]. However, he can live in a large monastery where all the duties are done and where there are none of the other disturbances.</span></p><p id="IV.4" class="vism-para"><strong>§4. </strong><em>2.</em><span> In </span><em>a new monastery </em><span>there is much new building activity.

The “cognitive series” </span><em>(citta-vīthi) </em><span>so extensively used here is unknown as such in the Piṭakas. Perhaps the seed from which it sprang may exist in, say, such passages as: “Due to eye and to visible data eye-consciousness arises. The coincidence of the three is contact. With contact as condition there is feeling. What he feels he perceives. What he perceives he thinks about4. What he thinks about he diversifies [by means of craving, pride and false view] … Due to mind and to mental data …” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 111</span></span><span>). And: “Is the eye permanent or impermanent … Are visible objects permanent or impermanent? … Is the mind permanent or impermanent? Are mental data … Is mind-consciousness … Is mind-contact … Is any feeling, any perception, any formation, any consciousness, that arises with mind-contact as condition permanent or impermanent?” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> III 279</span></span><span>). And: “These five faculties [of eye, etc.] each with its separate objective field and no one of them experiencing as its objective field the province of any other, have mind as their refuge, and mind experiences their provinces as its objective field” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 295</span></span><span>). This treatment of consciousness implies, as it were, more than even a “double thickness” of consciousness. An already-formed nucleus of the cognitive series, based on such Sutta Piṭakas material, appears in the Abhidhamma Piṭakas. The following two quotations show how the commentary (bracketed italics) expands the Abhidhamma Piṭakas treatment.</span></span><span class="p"><span>(i) “Herein, what is eye-consciousness element?

Here is the method. Skill in absorption needs [to be dealt with in] ten aspects: (1) making the basis clean, (2) maintaining balanced faculties, (3) skill in the sign, (4) he exerts the mind on an occasion when it should be exerted, (5) he restrains the mind on an occasion when it should be restrained, (6) he encourages the mind on an occasion when it should be encouraged, (7) he looks on at the mind with equanimity when it should be looked on at with equanimity, (8) avoidance of unconcentrated persons, (9) cultivation of concentrated persons, (10) resoluteness upon that (concentration).</span></p><p id="IV.43" class="vism-para"><strong>§43. </strong><em>1. </em><span>Herein, </span><em>making the basis clean</em><span> is cleansing the internal and the external basis. For when his head hair, nails and body hair are long, or when the body is soaked with sweat, then the internal basis is unclean and unpurified. But when an old dirty smelly robe is worn or when the lodging is dirty, then the external basis is unclean and unpurified. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(129)</span><span> When the internal and external bases are unclean, then the knowledge in the consciousness and consciousness-concomitants that arise is unpurified, like the light of a lamp’s flame that arises with an unpurified lamp-bowl, wick and oil as its support; formations do not become evident to one who tries to comprehend them with unpurified knowledge, and when he devotes himself to his meditation subject, it does not come to growth, increase and fulfilment.</span></p><p id="IV.44" class="vism-para"><strong>§44. </strong><span>But when the internal and external bases are clean, then the knowledge in the consciousness and consciousness-concomitants that arise is clean and purified, like the light of a lamp’s flame that arises with a purified lamp bowl, wick and oil as its support; formations become evident to one who tries to comprehend them with purified knowledge, and as he devotes himself to his meditation subject, it comes to growth, increase and fulfilment.</span></p><p id="IV.45" class="vism-para"><strong>§45. </strong><span class="vism-page-bps">[183|125]</span><em>2. Maintaining balanced faculties</em><span> is equalizing the [five] faculties of faith and the rest. For if his faith faculty is strong and the others weak, then the energy faculty cannot perform its function of exerting, the mindfulness faculty its function of establishing, the concentration faculty its function of not distracting, and the understanding faculty its function of seeing. So in that case the faith faculty should be modified either by reviewing the individual essences of the states [concerned, that is, the objects of attention] or by not giving [them] attention in the way in which the faith faculty became too strong. And this is illustrated by the story of the Elder Vakkali (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> III 119</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="IV.46" class="vism-para"><strong>§46. </strong><span>Then if the energy faculty is too strong, the faith faculty cannot perform its function of resolving, nor can the rest of the faculties perform their several functions. So in that case the energy faculty should be modified by developing tranquillity, and so on. And this should be illustrated by the story of the Elder Soṇa (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vin">Vin</a><span> I 179–185</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> III 374–376</span></span><span>). So too with the rest; for it should be understood that when anyone of them is too strong the others cannot perform their several functions.</span></p><p id="IV.47" class="vism-para"><strong>§47. </strong><span>However, what is particularly recommended is balancing faith with understanding, and concentration with energy. For one strong in faith and weak in understanding has confidence uncritically and groundlessly. One strong in understanding and weak in faith errs on the side of cunning and is as hard to cure as one sick of a disease caused by medicine. With the balancing of the two a man has confidence only when there are grounds for it.</span></p><p><span>Then idleness overpowers one strong in concentration and weak in energy, since concentration favours idleness. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(130)</span><span> Agitation overpowers one strong in energy and weak in concentration, since energy favours agitation. But concentration coupled with energy cannot lapse into idleness, and energy coupled with concentration cannot lapse into agitation. So these two should be balanced; for absorption comes with the balancing of the two.</span></p><p id="IV.48" class="vism-para"><strong>§48. </strong><span>Again, [concentration and faith should be balanced]. One working on concentration needs strong faith, since it is with such faith and confidence that he reaches absorption. Then there is [balancing of] concentration and understanding.

How?</span></p><p id="IV.81" class="vism-para"><strong>§81. </strong><span>When absoluteness is introduced thus, “quite secluded from sense desires,” what is expressed is this: sense desires are certainly incompatible with this jhāna; when they exist, it does not occur, just as when there is darkness, there is no lamplight; and it is only by letting go of them that it is reached, just as the further bank is reached only by letting go of the near bank. That is why absoluteness is introduced.</span></p><p id="IV.82" class="vism-para"><strong>§82. </strong><span>Here it might be asked: But why is this [word “quite”] mentioned only in the first phrase and not in the second? How is this, might he enter upon and </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[192|134]</span><span>dwell in the first jhāna even when not secluded from unprofitable things?—It should not be regarded in that way. It is mentioned in the first phrase as the escape from them; for this jhāna is the escape from sense desires since it surmounts the sense-desire element and since it is incompatible with greed for sense desires, according as it is said: “The escape from sense desires is this, that is to say, renunciation” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D">D</a><span> III 275</span></span><span>). But in the second phrase </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(140)</span><span> the word </span><em>eva </em><span>should be adduced and taken as said, as in the passage, “Bhikkhus, only (</span><em>eva</em><span>) here is there an ascetic, here a second ascetic” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 63</span></span><span>). For it is impossible to enter upon and dwell in jhāna unsecluded also from unprofitable things, in other words, the hindrances other than that [sense desire]. So this word must be read in both phrases thus: “Quite secluded from sense desires, quite secluded from unprofitable things.” And although the word “secluded” as a general term includes all kinds of seclusion, that is to say, seclusion by substitution of opposites, etc., and bodily seclusion, etc.,</span><span id="IV.n23" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>The five (see e.g. </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> II 220</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> I 85</span></span><span>) are suppression (by concentration), substitution of opposites (by insight), cutting off (by the path), tranquillization (by fruition), and escape (as Nibbāna); cf. five kinds of deliverance (e.g. </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> IV 168</span></span><span>).

They are agreeable visible objects …” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Nidd">Nidd</a><span> I 1</span></span><span>), and the sense desires as defilement given there too and in the Vibhaṅga thus: “Zeal as sense desire (</span><em>kāma</em><span>), greed as sense desire, zeal and greed as sense desire, thinking as sense desire, greed as sense desire, thinking and greed as sense desire”</span><span id="IV.n24" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>Here </span><em>saṅkappa </em><span>(“thinking”) has the meaning of “hankering.” </span><em>Chanda, kāma </em><span>and </span><em>rāga </em><span>and their combinations need sorting out. </span><em>Chanda </em><span>(zeal, desire) is much used, neutral in colour, good or bad according to context and glossed by “desire to act”; technically also one of the four roads to power and four predominances. </span><em>Kāma </em><span>(sense desire, sensuality) loosely represents enjoyment of the five sense pleasures (e.g. sense-desire sphere).

XIV, n.36</a><span>). The figure “five cords of sense desire” signifies simply these desires with the five sense objects that attract them. </span><em>Rāga </em><span>(greed) is the general term for desire in its bad sense and identical with </span><em>lobha, </em><span>which latter, however, appears technically as one of the three root-causes of unprofitable action. </span><em>Rāga </em><span>is renderable also by “lust” in its general sense. </span><em>Kāmacchanda </em><span>(lust): a technical term for the first of the five hindrances. </span><em>Chanda-rāga </em><span>(zeal and greed) and </span><em>kāma-rāga </em><span>(greed for sense desires) have no technical use.</span></span></span><span> (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Nidd">Nidd</a><span> I 2</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh">Vibh</a><span> 256</span></span><span>). That being so, the words “quite secluded from sense desires” properly mean “quite secluded from sense desires as object,” and express bodily seclusion, while the words “secluded from unprofitable things” properly mean “secluded from sense desires as defilement or from all unprofitable things,” and express mental seclusion. And in this case giving up of pleasure in sense desires is indicated by the first since it only expresses seclusion from sense desires as object, while acquisition of pleasure </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[193|135]</span><span>in renunciation is indicated by the second since it expresses seclusion from sense desire as defilement.</span></p><p id="IV.84" class="vism-para"><strong>§84. </strong><span>And with sense desires as object and sense desires as defilement expressed in this way, it should also be recognized that the abandoning of the objective basis for defilement is indicated by the first of these two phrases and the abandoning of the [subjective] defilement by the second; also that the giving up of the cause of cupidity is indicated by the first and [the giving up of the cause] of stupidity by the second; also that the purification of one’s occupation is indicated by the first and the educating of one’s inclination by the second.</span></p><p><span>This, firstly, is the method here when the words </span><em>from sense desires </em><span>are treated as referring to sense desires as object.</span></p><p id="IV.85" class="vism-para"><strong>§85. </strong><span>But if they are treated as referring to sense desires as defilement, then it is simply just zeal for sense desires (</span><em>kāmacchanda</em><span>) in the various forms of zeal (</span><em>chanda</em><span>), greed (</span><em>rāga</em><span>), etc., that is intended as “sense desires” (</span><em>kāma</em><span>) (</span><a href="#IV.83">§83</a><span>, 2nd quotation). </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(141)</span><span> And although that [lust] is also included by [the word] “unprofitable,” it is nevertheless stated separately in the Vibhaṅga in the way beginning, “Herein, what are sense desires?

For the hindrances are the contrary opposites of the jhāna factors: what is meant is that the jhāna factors are incompatible with them, eliminate them, abolish them. And it is said accordingly in the </span><em>Peṭaka</em><span> (</span><em>Peṭakopadesa</em><span>): “Concentration is incompatible with lust, happiness with ill will, applied thought with stiffness and torpor, bliss with agitation and worry, and sustained thought with uncertainty” (not in </span><em>Peṭakopadesa</em><span>).</span></p><p id="IV.87" class="vism-para"><strong>§87. </strong><span>So in this case it should be understood that seclusion by suppression (suspension) of lust is indicated by the phrase quite secluded from sense desires, and seclusion by suppression (suspension) of [all] five hindrances by the phrase secluded from unprofitable things.

Similarly with the three unprofitable roots, that of greed, which has the five cords of sense desire (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 85</span></span><span>) as its province, is indicated by the first, and that of hate and delusion, which have as their respective provinces the various grounds for annoyance (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> IV 408</span></span><span>; V 150), etc., by the second.

She stepped out of the house onto a balcony and stood looking at the Ākāsacetiya Shrine at Girikaṇḍaka lit by the moon. She saw the offering of lamps at the shrine, and the four communities as they circumambulated it to the right after making their offerings of flowers and perfumes; and she heard the sound of the massed recital by the Community of Bhikkhus. Then she thought: “How lucky they are to be able to go to the monastery and wander round such a shrine terrace and listen to such sweet preaching of Dhamma!” Seeing the shrine as a mound of pearls and arousing uplifting happiness, she sprang up into the air, and before her parents arrived she came down from the air into the shrine terrace, where she paid homage and stood listening to the Dhamma.</span></p><p id="IV.97" class="vism-para"><strong>§97. </strong><span>When her parents arrived, they asked her, “What road did you come by?” She said, “I came through the air, not by the road,” and when they told her, “My dear, those whose cankers are destroyed come through the air. But how did you come?” she replied: “As I was standing looking at the shrine in the moonlight a strong sense of happiness arose in me with the Enlightened One as its object. Then I knew no more whether I was standing or sitting, but only that I was springing up into the air with the sign that I had grasped, and I came to rest on this shrine terrace.”</span></p><p><span>So uplifting happiness can be powerful enough to levitate the body, make it spring up into the air.</span></p><p id="IV.98" class="vism-para"><strong>§98. </strong><span>But when </span><em>pervading</em><span> (</span><em>rapturous</em><span>) </span><em>happiness</em><span> arises, the whole body is completely pervaded, like a filled bladder, like a rock cavern invaded by a huge inundation.</span></p><p id="IV.99" class="vism-para"><strong>§99. </strong><span>Now, this fivefold happiness, when conceived and matured, perfects the twofold tranquillity, that is, bodily and mental tranquillity.

So it is these only that are called factors of abandoning because they are specifically obstructive to jhāna.</span></p><p id="IV.106" class="vism-para"><strong>§106. </strong><span>But applied thought directs the mind onto the object; sustained thought keeps it anchored there. Happiness produced by the success of the effort refreshes the mind whose effort has succeeded through not being distracted by those hindrances; and bliss intensifies it for the same reason. Then unification aided by this directing onto, this anchoring, this refreshing and this intensifying, evenly and rightly centres (</span><a href="#III.3">III.3</a><span>) the mind with its remaining associated states on the object consisting in unity. Consequently, possession of five factors should be understood as the arising of these five, namely, applied thought, sustained thought, happiness, bliss and unification of mind.</span></p><p id="IV.107" class="vism-para"><strong>§107. </strong><span>For it is when these are arisen that jhāna is said to be arisen, which is why they are called the five factors of possession. Therefore it should not be assumed that the jhāna is something other which possesses them. But just as “The army with the four factors” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vin">Vin</a><span> IV 104</span></span><span>) and “Music with the five factors” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> II 300</span></span><span>) and “The path with the eight factors (eightfold path)” are stated simply in terms of their factors, so this too </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(147)</span><span> should be understood as stated simply in terms of its factors, when it is said to “have five factors” or “possess five factors.”</span></p><p id="IV.108" class="vism-para"><strong>§108. </strong><span>And while these five factors are present also at the moment of access and are stronger in access than in normal consciousness, they are still stronger here than in access and acquire the characteristic of the fine-material sphere. For applied thought arises here directing the mind on to the object in an extremely lucid manner, and sustained thought does so pressing the object very hard, and the happiness and bliss pervade the entire body. Hence it is said: “And there is nothing of his whole body not permeated by the happiness and bliss born of seclusion” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D">D</a><span> I 73</span></span><span>).

So some comment.</span><span id="IV.n33" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“The inmates of the Abhayagiri Monastery in Anurādhapura” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 144</span></span><span>).</span></span></span><span> But it is said in the text, “The mind arrived at unity enters into purification of the way, is intensified in equanimity, and is satisfied by knowledge” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> I 167</span></span><span>), and therefore it is from the standpoint within actual absorption that </span><em>purification of the way </em><span>firstly should be understood as the approach, with </span><em>intensification of equanimity </em><span>as the function of equanimity consisting in specific neutrality, and </span><em>satisfaction</em><span> as the manifestation of clarifying knowledge’s function in accomplishing non-excess of states. How?</span></p><p id="IV.115" class="vism-para"><strong>§115. </strong><span>Firstly, in a cycle [of consciousness] in which absorption arises the mind becomes purified from the group of defilements called hindrances that are an obstruction to jhāna. Being devoid of obstruction because it has been purified, it makes way for the central [state of equilibrium, which is the] sign of serenity. Now, it is the absorption concentration itself occurring evenly that is called </span><em>the sign of serenity</em><span>. But the consciousness immediately before that </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(149)</span><span> reaches that state by way of change in a single continuity (cf. </span><a href="#XXII.1">XXII.1</a><span>–</span><a href="#XXII.6">6</a><span>), and so it is said that it </span><em>makes way for the central [state of equilibrium, which is the] sign of serenity</em><span>. And it is said that it </span><em>enters into that state</em><span> by approaching it through having made way for it. That is why in the first place </span><em>purification of the way</em><span>, while referring to aspects existing in the preceding consciousness, should nevertheless be understood as the approach at the moment of the first jhāna’s actual arising.</span></p><p id="IV.116" class="vism-para"><strong>§116. </strong><span>Secondly, when he has more interest in purifying, since there is no need to re-purify what has already been purified thus, it is said that </span><em>he looks on with equanimity at the mind that is purified</em><span>. And when he has no more interest in concentrating again what has already made way for serenity by arriving at the state of serenity, it is said that </span><em>he looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for serenity</em><span>. And when he has no more interest in again causing appearance of unity in what has already appeared as unity through abandonment of its association with defilement in making way for serenity, it is said that </span><em>he looks on with equanimity at the appearance of unity</em><span>. That is why </span><em>intensification of equanimity </em><span>should be understood as the function of equanimity that consists in specific neutrality.</span></p><p id="IV.117" class="vism-para"><strong>§117. </strong><span>And lastly, when equanimity was thus intensified, the states called concentration and understanding produced there, occurred coupled together without either one exceeding the other. And also the [five] faculties beginning with faith occurred with the single function (taste) of deliverance owing to deliverance from the various defilements. And also the energy appropriate to that, which was favourable to their state of non-excess and single function, was </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[201|143]</span><span>effective. And also its repetition occurs at that moment.</span><span id="IV.n34" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“‘</span><em>Its</em><span>’: of that jhāna consciousness. ‘</span><em>At that moment’: </em><span>at the moment of dissolution; for when the moment of arising is past, repetition occurs starting with the moment of presence” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 145</span></span><span>). A curious argument; see §182.</span></span></span><span> Now, all these [four] aspects are only produced because it is after seeing with knowledge the various dangers in defilement and advantages in cleansing that satisfiedness, purifiedness and clarifiedness ensue accordingly. That is the reason why it was said that </span><em>satisfaction </em><span>should be understood as the manifestation of clarifying knowledge’s function in accomplishing non-excess, etc., of states (</span><a href="#IV.114">§114</a><span>).</span></p><p id="IV.118" class="vism-para"><strong>§118. </strong><span>Herein, satisfaction as a function of knowledge is called “the end” since the knowledge is evident as due to onlooking equanimity, according as it is said: “He looks on with complete equanimity at the mind thus exerted; then the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to equanimity. Owing to equanimity the mind is liberated from the many sorts of defilements; then the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to liberation. Because of being liberated these states come to have a single function; then [the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to] development in the sense of the single function”</span><span id="IV.n35" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>The quotation is incomplete and the end should read, “… </span><em>ekarasaṭṭhena bhāvanāvasena paññāvasena paññindriyaṃ adhimattaṃ hoti</em><span>.”</span></span></span><span> (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> II 25</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="IV.119" class="vism-para"><strong>§119. </strong><span>Now, as to the words </span><em>and so he has attained the first jhāna … of the earth kasiṇa </em><span>(</span><a href="#IV.79">§79</a><span>): Here it is </span><em>first </em><span>because it starts a numerical series; </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(150)</span><span> also it is first because it arises first.

So too the meditator must discern such modes as that of suitable food, etc., thus: “I attained this after eating this food, attending on such a person, in such a lodging, in this posture at this time.” In this way, when that [absorption] is lost, he will be able to recapture those modes and renew the absorption, or while familiarizing himself with it he will be able to repeat that absorption again and again.</span></p><p id="IV.121" class="vism-para"><strong>§121. </strong><span>And just as when a skilled cook is serving his employer, he notices whatever he chooses to eat and from then on brings only that sort and so obtains </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[202|144]</span><span>a reward, so too this meditator discerns such modes as that of the food, etc., at the time of the attaining, and he recaptures them and re-obtains absorption each time it is lost. So he must discern the modes as a hair-splitter or a cook does.</span></p><p id="IV.122" class="vism-para"><strong>§122. </strong><span>And this has been said by the Blessed One: “Bhikkhus, suppose a wise, clever, skilful cook set various kinds of sauces before a king or a king’s minister, such as sour, bitter, sharp, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(151)</span><span> sweet, peppery and unpeppery, salty and unsalty sauces; then the wise, clever, skilful cook learned his master’s sign thus ‘today this sauce pleased my master’ or ‘he held out his hand for this one’ or ‘he took a lot of this one’ or ‘he praised this one’ or ‘today the sour kind pleased my master’ or ‘he held out his hand for the sour kind’ or ‘he took a lot of the sour kind’ or ‘he praised the sour kind’ … or ‘he praised the unsalty kind’; then the wise, clever, skilful cook is rewarded with clothing and wages and presents. Why is that? Because that wise, clever, skilful cook learned his master’s sign in this way. So too, bhikkhus, here a wise, clever, skilful bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body as a body … He dwells contemplating feelings as feelings … consciousness as consciousness … mental objects as mental objects, ardent, fully aware and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. As he dwells contemplating mental objects as mental objects, his mind becomes concentrated, his defilements are abandoned. He learns the sign of that.

That is why, although faith does exist in it, it is not called “confidence.” And there too concentration is not fully evident because of the lack of full confidence. That is why it is not called “singleness” there. But in this second jhāna faith is strong, having got a footing in the absence of the impediments of applied and sustained thought; and concentration is also evident through having strong faith as its companion. That may be understood as the reason why only this jhāna is described in this way.</span></p><p id="IV.145" class="vism-para"><strong>§145. </strong><span>But that much is actually stated in the Vibhaṅga too with the words: “‘Confidence’ is faith, having faith, trust, full confidence. ‘Singleness of mind’ is steadiness of consciousness … right concentration” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh">Vibh</a><span> 258</span></span><span>).

Did we not say earlier: “The phrase ‘with the stilling of applied and sustained thought’ is expressed in this way in order to indicate that the act of attaining the other jhānas, beginning with that of the second from the first, is effected by the surmounting of the gross factor in each case?” (</span><a href="#IV.140">§140</a><span>).</span></p><p id="IV.147" class="vism-para"><strong>§147. </strong><span>Besides, this confidence comes about with the act of stilling, not the darkness of defilement, but the applied and sustained thought.

So that [first] clause indicates the cause of the confidence and singleness. In the same way this jhāna is without applied thought and without sustained thought, not as in the third and fourth jhānas or as in eye-consciousness, etc., with just absence, but with the actual act of stilling the applied and sustained thought.

Nor, they say, is there any conflict with the Paṭṭhāna text to be fancied here, since what is shown there is only grief that occurs making lost jhāna its object because the grief that occurs making its object a jhāna that has not been lost is not relevant there. And they say that it cannot be maintained that grief does not arise at all in those who have obtained jhāna since it did arise in Asita who had the eight attainments (Sn 691), and he was not one who had lost jhāna. So they say. That is wrong because there is no hate without the nature of a hindrance. If there were, it would arise in fine-material and immaterial beings, and it does not. Accordingly when in such passages as, ‘In the immaterial state, due to the hindrance of lust there is the hindrance of stiffness and torpor … the hindrance of agitation, the hindrance of ignorance’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭṭh">Paṭṭh</a><span> II 291</span></span><span>), ill will and worry are not mentioned as hindrances, that does not imply that they are not hindrances even by supposing that it was because lust, etc., were not actually hindrances and were called hindrances there figuratively because of resemblance to hindrances. And it is no reason to argue, ‘it is because it arose in Asita,’ since there is falling away from jhāna with the arising of grief. The way to regard that is that when the jhāna is lost for some trivial reason such men reinstate it without difficulty” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 158–159</span></span><span>).</span></span></span><span> due to contact with gadflies, flies, etc. or the discomfort of an uneven seat, though that pain faculty had already ceased, but not so during absorption. Or else, though it has ceased during access, it has not absolutely ceased there since it is not quite beaten out by opposition. But during absorption the whole body is showered with bliss owing to pervasion by happiness. And the pain faculty has absolutely ceased in one whose body is showered with bliss, since it is beaten out then by opposition.</span></p><p id="IV.188" class="vism-para"><strong>§188. </strong><span class="vism-page-bps">[216|158]</span><span>And during the second-jhāna access too, which has multiple advertings, there could be rearising of the [mental] grief faculty, although it had already ceased there, because it arises when there is bodily weariness and mental vexation, which have applied thought and sustained thought as their condition, but it does not arise when applied and sustained thought are absent. When it arises, it does so in the presence of applied and sustained thought, and they are not abandoned in the second-jhāna access; but this is not so in the second jhāna itself because its conditions are abandoned there.</span></p><p id="IV.189" class="vism-para"><strong>§189. </strong><span>Likewise in the third-jhāna access there could be rearising of the abandoned [bodily] pleasure faculty in one whose body was pervaded by the superior materiality originated by the [consciousness associated with the] happiness. But not so in the third jhāna itself. For in the third jhāna the happiness that is a condition for the [bodily] bliss (pleasure) has ceased entirely. Likewise in the fourth-jhāna access there could be re-arising of the abandoned [mental] joy faculty because of its nearness and because it has not been properly surmounted owing to the absence of equanimity brought to absorption strength. But not so in the fourth jhāna itself. And that is why in each case (</span><a href="#IV.186">§186</a><span>) the words “without remainder” are included thus: “It is here that the arisen pain faculty ceases without remainder.”</span></p><p id="IV.190" class="vism-para"><strong>§190. </strong><span>Here it may be asked: Then if these kinds of feeling are abandoned in the access in this way, why are they brought in here? It is done so that they can be readily grasped. For the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling described here by the words “which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure” is subtle, hard to recognize and not readily grasped. So just as, when a cattle-herd</span><span id="IV.n50" class="footnote"><span class="p"><em>Gopa—</em><span>“cowherd (or guardian)”: not in PED.</span></span></span><span> wants to catch a refractory ox that cannot be caught at all by approaching it, he collects all the cattle into one pen </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(167)</span><span> and lets them out one by one, and then [he says] “That is it; catch it,” and so it gets caught as well, so too the Blessed One has collected all these [five kinds of feeling] together so that they can be grasped readily; for when they are shown collected together in this way, then what is not [bodily] pleasure (bliss) or [bodily] pain or [mental] joy or [mental] grief can still be grasped in this way: “This is neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.”</span></p><p id="IV.191" class="vism-para"><strong>§191. </strong><span>Besides, this may be understood as said in order to show the condition for the neither-painful-nor-pleasant mind-deliverance. For the abandoning of [bodily] pain, etc., are conditions for that, according as it is said: “There are four conditions, friend, for the attainment of the neither-painful-nor-pleasant mind-deliverance. Here, friend, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells in the fourth jhāna … equanimity.

Or alternatively, they can be understood as mentioned for the purpose of showing that greed and hate are very far away owing to the removal of their conditions; for of these, pleasure (bliss) is a condition for joy, and joy for greed; pain is a condition for grief and grief for hate.

By this he indicates the third kind of feeling that is in opposition both to pain and to pleasure, not the mere absence of pain and pleasure. This third kind of feeling named neither-pain-nor-pleasure is also called “equanimity.” It has the characteristic of experiencing what is contrary to both the desirable and the undesirable. Its function is neutral. Its manifestation is unevident. Its proximate cause should be understood as the cessation of pleasure (bliss).</span></p><p id="IV.194" class="vism-para"><strong>§194. </strong><em>And has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity</em><span>: has purity of mindfulness brought about by equanimity. For the mindfulness in this jhāna is quite purified, and its purification is effected by equanimity, not by anything else. That is why it is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. Also it is said in the Vibhaṅga: “This mindfulness is cleared, purified, clarified, by equanimity; hence it is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh">Vibh</a><span> 261</span></span><span>). </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(168)</span><span> And the equanimity due to which there comes to be this purity of mindfulness should be understood as specific neutrality in meaning.

That is why no one among these [first three jhānas] is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. But here this crescent moon consisting in specific neutrality is utterly pure because it is not outshone by the glare of the opposing states consisting in applied thought, etc., and because it has the night of equanimity-as-feeling for its ally.

The venerable one, it seems, thought to abandon gain and honour and live a secluded life. He boarded a ship at Mahātittha (Mannar) and sailed to Jambudīpa (India).

When it comes into focus alike whether he opens his eyes and looks or closes his eyes and adverts, then it is called properly apprehended.</span></p><p id="VI.52" class="vism-para"><strong>§52. </strong><span>When he has thus properly apprehended the sign, properly remembered it, and properly defined it, then if he is unable to conclude his development on the spot, he can go to his own lodging, alone, in the same way as described of his coming, with no companion, keeping that same meditation subject in mind, with mindfulness well established, and with his mind not turned outwards owing to his faculties being turned inwards.</span></p><p id="VI.53" class="vism-para"><strong>§53. </strong><span>As he leaves the charnel ground he should define the path he comes back by thus: “The path by which I have left goes in an easterly direction, westerly … northerly … southerly direction,” or “It goes in an intermediate direction”; or “In this place it goes to the left, in this place to the right”; and “In this place there is a stone, in this a termite-mound, in this a tree, in this a bush, in this a creeper.”</span></p><p id="VI.54" class="vism-para"><strong>§54. </strong><span>When he has defined the path he has come back by and when, once back, he is walking up and down, he should see that his walk is oriented towards it too; the meaning is that he should walk up and down on a piece of ground that faces in the direction of the sign of foulness. And when he sits, he should prepare a seat oriented towards it too.</span></p><p id="VI.55" class="vism-para"><strong>§55. </strong><span>But if there is a bog or a ravine or a tree or a fence or a swamp in that direction, if he cannot walk up and down on a piece of ground facing in that direction, if he cannot prepare his seat thus because there is no room for it, then he can both walk up and down and sit in a place where there is room, even though it does not face that way; but he should turn his mind in that direction.</span></p><p id="VI.56" class="vism-para"><strong>§56. </strong><span>Now, as to the questions beginning with </span><em>what is the purpose … characterizing the surrounding signs</em><span>? The intention of the answer that begins with the words, </span><em>has non-delusion for its purpose</em><span>, is this: If someone goes at the wrong time to the place where the sign of the bloated is, and opens his eyes for the purpose of apprehending the sign by characterizing the surrounding signs, then as soon as he looks the dead body appears </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(187)</span><span> as if it were standing up and threatening</span><span id="VI.n9" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>There is no sense of </span><em>ajjhottharati</em><span> given in PED that fits here.

For among the thirty-eight meditation subjects expounded in the texts no object is so frightening as this one. There are some who lose jhāna in this meditation subject. Why? Because it is so frightening.</span></p><p id="VI.57" class="vism-para"><strong>§57. </strong><span class="vism-page-bps">[235|177]</span><span>So the meditator must stand firm. Establishing his mindfulness well, he should remove his fears in this way: “No dead body gets up and pursues one. If that stone or that creeper close to it were to come, the body might come too; but since that stone or that creeper does not come, the body will not come either. Its appearance to you in this way is born: of your perception, created by your perception. Today your meditation subject has appeared to you. Do not be afraid, bhikkhu.” He should laugh it off and direct his mind to the sign. In that way he will arrive at distinction. The words “Characterizing the surrounding signs has non-delusion for its purpose” are said on this account.</span></p><p id="VI.58" class="vism-para"><strong>§58. </strong><span>To succeed in apprehending the sign in the eleven ways is to anchor the meditation subject. For the opening of his eyes and looking conditions the arising of the learning sign; and as he exercises his mind on that the counterpart sign arises; and as he exercises his mind on that he reaches absorption. When he is sure of absorption, he works up insight and realizes Arahantship. Hence it was said: </span><em>apprehending the sign in the [other] eleven ways has anchoring [the mind] for its purpose</em><span>.</span></p><p id="VI.59" class="vism-para"><strong>§59. </strong><em>The reviewing of the path gone by and come by has keeping [the mind] on the track for its purpose</em><span>: the meaning is that the reviewing of the path gone by and of the path come back by mentioned is for the purpose of keeping properly to the track of the meditation subject.</span></p><p id="VI.60" class="vism-para"><strong>§60. </strong><span>For if this bhikkhu is going along with his meditation subject and people on the way ask him about the day, “What is today, venerable sir?” or they ask him some question [about Dhamma], or they welcome him, he ought not to go on in silence, thinking “I have a meditation subject.” The day must be told, the question must be answered, even by saying “I do not know” if he does not know, a legitimate welcome must be responded to. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(188)</span><span> As he does so, the newly acquired sign vanishes. But even if it does vanish, he should still tell the day when asked; if he does not know the answer to the question, he should still say “I do not know,” and if he does know it, he should explain it surely;</span><span id="VI.n10" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>Reading </span><em>ekaṃsena</em><span> (surely) with Harvard text rather than </span><em>ekadesena</em><span> (partly).</span></span></span><span> and he must respond to a welcome. Also reception of visitors must be attended to on seeing a visiting bhikkhu, and all the remaining duties in the Khandhakas must be carried out too, that is, the duties of the shrine terrace, the duties of the Bodhi-tree terrace, the duties of the Uposatha house, the duties of the refectory and the bath house, and those to the teacher, the preceptor, visitors, departing bhikkhus, and the rest.</span></p><p id="VI.61" class="vism-para"><strong>§61. </strong><span>And the newly acquired sign vanishes while he is carrying out these too. When he wants to go again, thinking “I shall go and take up the sign,” he finds he cannot go to the charnel ground because it has been invaded by non-human beings or by wild beasts, or the sign has disappeared. For a bloated corpse only lasts one or two days and then turns into a livid corpse. Of all the meditation subjects there is none so hard to come by as this.</span></p><p id="VI.62" class="vism-para"><strong>§62. </strong><span>So when the sign has vanished in this way, the bhikkhu should sit down in his night quarters or in his day quarters and first of all review the path gone by and come by up to the place where he is actually sitting cross-legged, doing it in </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[236|178]</span><span>this way: “I went out of the monastery by this gate, I took a path leading in such and such a direction, I turned left at such and such a place, I turned right at such and such a place, in one part of it there was a stone, in another a termite-mound or a tree or a bush or a creeper; having gone by that path, I saw the foulness in such and such a place, I stood there facing in such and such a direction and observed such and such surrounding signs, I apprehended the sign of foulness in this way; I left the charnel ground in such and such a direction, I came back by such and such a path doing this and this, and I am now sitting here.”</span></p><p id="VI.63" class="vism-para"><strong>§63. </strong><span>As he reviews it in this way, the sign becomes evident and appears as if placed in front of him; the meditation subject rides in its track as it did before. Hence it was said:</span><em> the reviewing of the path gone by and come by has keeping [the mind] on the track for its purpose</em><span>.</span></p><p id="VI.64" class="vism-para"><strong>§64. </strong><span>Now, as to the words, when he has established reverence for it by seeing its advantages and by perceiving it as a treasure and so come to love it, he anchors the mind on that object: here, having gained jhāna by exercising his mind on the repulsiveness in the bloated, he should increase insight with the jhāna as its proximate cause, and then he should see the advantages in this way: </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(189)</span><span> “Surely in this way I shall be liberated from ageing and death.”</span></p><p id="VI.65" class="vism-para"><strong>§65. </strong><span>Just as a pauper who acquired a treasure of gems would guard and love it with great affection, feeling reverence for it as one who appreciates the value of it, “I have got what is hard indeed to get!” so too [this bhikkhu] should guard the sign, loving it and feeling reverence for it as one who appreciates the value of it, “I have got this meditation subject, which is indeed as hard to get as a very valuable treasure is for a pauper to get. For one whose meditation subject is the four elements discerns the four primary elements in himself, one whose meditation subject is breathing discerns the wind in his own nostrils, and one whose meditation subject is a kasiṇa makes a kasiṇa and develops it at his ease, so these other meditation subjects are easily got. But this one lasts only one, or two days, after which it turns into a livid corpse. There is none harder to get than this one.” In his night quarters and in his day quarters he should keep his mind anchored there thus, “Repulsiveness of the bloated, repulsiveness of the bloated.” And he should advert to the sign, bring it to mind and strike at it with thought and applied thought over and over again.</span></p><p id="VI.66" class="vism-para"><strong>§66. </strong><span>As he does so, the counterpart sign arises. Here is the difference between the two signs. The learning sign appears as a hideous, dreadful and frightening sight; but the counterpart sign appears like a man with big limbs lying down after eating his fill.</span></p><p id="VI.67" class="vism-para"><strong>§67. </strong><span>Simultaneously with his acquiring the counterpart sign, his lust is abandoned by suppression owing to his giving no attention externally to sense desires [as object]. And owing to his abandoning of approval, ill will is abandoned too, as pus is with the abandoning of blood. Likewise stiffness and torpor are abandoned through exertion of energy, agitation and worry are abandoned through devotion to peaceful things that cause no remorse; and uncertainty about the Master who teaches the way, about the way, and about the fruit of the way, is abandoned through the actual experience of the distinction attained. So </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[237|179]</span><span>the five hindrances are abandoned. And there are present applied thought with the characteristic of directing the mind on to that same sign, and sustained thought accomplishing the function of pressing on the sign, and happiness due to the acquisition of distinction, and tranquillity due to the production of tranquillity in one whose mind is happy, and bliss with that tranquillity as its sign, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(190)</span><span> and unification that has bliss as its sign due to the production of concentration in one whose mind is blissful. So the jhāna factors become manifest.</span></p><p id="VI.68" class="vism-para"><strong>§68. </strong><span>Thus access, which is the obverse of the first jhāna, is produced in him too at that same moment.

But if he looks at it, [apprehending it only] by its colour as white, it does not appear to him [with its individual essence as repulsive], but only as a variant of the white kasiṇa. Consequently he should only look at it as ‘a skeleton’ in the repulsive aspect.</span></p><p id="VI.79" class="vism-para"><strong>§79. </strong><span>“Mark” is a term for the hand, etc., here, so he should define it </span><em>by its mark </em><span>according to hand, foot, head, chest, arm, waist, thigh, and shin. He should define it </span><em>by its shape</em><span>, however, according as it is long, short, square, round, small or large. </span><em>By its direction and by its location</em><span> are as already described (</span><a href="#VI.39">§39</a><span>–</span><a href="#VI.40">40</a><span>). Having defined it </span><em>by its delimitation</em><span> according to the periphery of each bone, he should reach absorption by apprehending whichever appears most evident to him. But it can also be defined </span><em>by its concavities</em><span> and </span><em>by its convexities</em><span> according to the concave and convex places in each bone. And it can also be defined by position thus: “I am standing in a concave place, the skeleton is in a convex place; or I am standing in a convex place, the skeleton is in a concave place.” It should be defined </span><em>by its joints</em><span> according as any two bones are joined together. It should be defined </span><em>by its openings</em><span> according to the gaps separating the bones. It should be defined </span><em>all round </em><span>by directing knowledge to it comprehensively thus: “In this place there is this skeleton.” If the sign does not arise even in this way, then the mind should be established on the frontal bone. And in this case, just as in the case of those that precede it beginning with the worm-infested, the apprehending of the sign should be observed in this elevenfold manner as appropriate.</span></p><p id="VI.80" class="vism-para"><strong>§80. </strong><span>This meditation subject is successful with a whole skeleton frame and even with a single bone as well. So having learnt the sign in anyone of these in the eleven ways, he should bring it to mind as “Repulsiveness of a skeleton, repulsiveness of a skeleton.” Here the learning sign and the counterpart sign are alike, so it is said. That is correct for a single bone. But when the learning sign becomes manifest in a skeleton frame, what is correct [to say] is that there are gaps in the learning sign while the counterpart sign appears whole. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(193)</span><span> And the learning sign even in a single bone should be dreadful and terrifying but the counterpart sign produces happiness and joy because it brings access.</span></p><p id="VI.81" class="vism-para"><strong>§81. </strong><span>What is said in the Commentaries in this context allows that deduction. For there, after saying this, “There is no counterpart sign in the four divine abidings and in the ten kinds of foulness; for in the case of the divine abidings the sign is the breaking down of boundaries itself, and in the case of the ten kinds of foulness the sign comes into being as soon as the repulsiveness is seen, without any thinking about it,” it is again said, immediately next: “Here the sign is twofold: the learning sign and the counterpart sign. The learning sign appears hideous, dreadful and terrifying,” and so on. So what we said was well considered. And it is only this that is correct here. Besides, the appearance of a </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[240|182]</span><span>woman’s whole body as a collection of bones to the Elder Mahā-Tissa through his merely looking at her teeth demonstrates this here (see </span><a href="#I.55">I.55</a><span>).</span></p><p id="VI.82" class="vism-para"><strong>§82. </strong></p><div class="vism-verse"><div><span>The Divine Ruler with ten hundred eyes</span></div><div><span>Did him with the Ten Powers eulogize,</span></div><div><span>Who, fair in fame, made known as cause of jhāna</span></div><div><span>This foulness of ten species in such wise.</span></div><div><span>Now, knowing their description and the way</span></div><div><span>To tackle each and how they are developed,</span></div><div><span>There are some further points that will repay</span></div><div><span>Study, each with its special part to play.</span></div></div></section><section class="sect-dp3"><h1><span>General</span></h1><p id="VI.83" class="vism-para"><strong>§83. </strong><span>One who has reached jhāna in anyone of these goes free from cupidity; he resembles [an Arahant] without greed because his greed has been well suppressed.

This is a term for mindfulness with the Enlightened One’s special qualities as its object.</span></p><p><span>The recollection arisen inspired by the Law is the </span><em>recollection of the Dhamma</em><span>.</span><span id="VII.n1" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>The word </span><em>dhamma—</em><span>perhaps the most important and frequently used of Pali words—has no single equivalent in English because no English word has both a generalization so wide and loose as the word </span><em>dhamma</em><span> in its widest sense (which includes “everything” that can be known or thought of in any way) and at the same time an ability to be, as it were, focused in a set of well-defined specific uses. Roughly </span><em>dhamma</em><span> = what-can-be-remembered or what-can-be-borne-in-mind (</span><em>dhāretabba</em><span>) as </span><em>kamma</em><span> = what-can-be-done (</span><em>kātabba</em><span>). The following two principal (and overlapping) senses are involved here: (i) the Law as taught, and (ii) objects of consciousness. (i) In the first case the word has either been left untranslated as “Dhamma” or “dhamma” or it has been tendered as “Law” or “law.” This ranges from the loose sense of the “Good Law,” “cosmic law,” and “teaching” to such specific technical senses as the “discrimination of law,” “causality,” “being subject to or having the nature of.” (ii) In the second case the word in its looser sense of “something known or thought of” has either been left untranslated as “dhamma” or rendered by “state” (more rarely by “thing” or “phenomenon”), while in its technical sense as one of the twelve bases or eighteen elements “mental object” and “mental datum” have been used. The sometimes indiscriminate use of “dhamma,” “state” and “law” in both the looser senses is deliberate. The English words have been reserved as far as possible for rendering </span><em>dhamma</em><span> (except that “state” has sometimes been used to render </span><em>bhāva</em><span>, etc., in the sense of “-ness”). Other subsidiary meanings of a non-technical nature have occasionally been otherwise rendered according to context.</span></span><span class="p"><span>In order to avoid muddle it is necessary to distinguish renderings of the word </span><em>dhamma</em><span> and renderings of the words used to define it. The word itself is a gerundive of the verb </span><em>dharati </em><span>(caus. </span><em>dhāreti—</em><span>“to bear”) and so is the literal equivalent of “[quality] that is to be borne.” But since the grammatical meanings of the two words </span><em>dharati</em><span> (“to bear”) and </span><em>dahati </em><span>(“to put or sort out,” whence </span><em>dhātu—</em><span>“element”) sometimes coalesce, it often comes very close to </span><em>dhātu</em><span> (but see VIII n. 68 and </span><a href="#XI.104">XI.104</a><span>). If it is asked, what bears the qualities to be borne? A correct answer here would probably be that it is the event (</span><em>samaya</em><span>), as stated in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī (§1, etc.), in which the various dhammas listed there arise and are present, variously related to each other. The word </span><em>dhammin</em><span> (thing qualified or “bearer of what is to be borne”) is a late introduction as a logical term (perhaps first used in Pali by </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a></span><span>, see p. 534).</span></span><span class="p"><span>As to the definitions of the word, there are several. At D-a I 99 four meanings are given: moral (meritorious) special quality (</span><em>guṇa</em><span>), preaching of the Law (</span><em>desanā</em><span>), scripture (</span><em>pariyatti</em><span>), and “no-living-being-ness” (</span><em>nissattatā</em><span>).

Otherwise the words “Six kinds of knowledge unshared [by disciples]” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> I 3</span></span><span>) would be contradicted? [Note: The six kinds are: knowledge of what faculties prevail in beings, knowledge of the inclinations and tendencies of beings, knowledge of the Twin Marvel, knowledge of the attainment of the great compassion, omniscient knowledge, and unobstructed knowledge (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> I 133</span></span><span>)].—There is no contradiction, because two ways in which a single kind of knowledge’s objective field occurs are described for the purpose of showing by means of this difference how it is not shared by others.</span></span><span class="p"><span>It is only one kind of knowledge; but it is called omniscient knowledge because its objective field consists of formed, unformed, and conventional (</span><em>sammuti</em><span>) [i.e. conceptual] dhammas without remainder, and it is called unobstructed knowledge because of its unrestricted access to the objective field, because of absence of obstruction. And it is said accordingly in the Paṭisambhidā: “It knows all the formed and the unformed without remainder, thus it is omniscient knowledge. It has no obstruction therein, thus it is unobstructed knowledge” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> I 131</span></span><span>), and so on. So they are not different kinds of knowledge. And there must be no reservation, otherwise it would follow that omniscient and unobstructed knowledge had obstructions and did not make all dhammas its object. There is not in fact a minimal obstruction to the</span></span><span class="p"><span>Blessed One’s knowledge: and if his unobstructed knowledge did not have all dhammas as its object, there would be presence of obstruction where it did not occur, and so it would not be unobstructed.</span></span><span class="p"><span>“Or alternatively, even if we suppose that they are different, still it is omniscient knowledge itself that is intended as ‘unhindered’ since it is that which occurs unhindered universally. And it is by his attainment of that that the Blessed One is known as Omniscient, All-seer, Fully Enlightened, not because of awareness (</span><em>avabodha</em><span>) of every dhamma at once, simultaneously (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> II 127</span></span><span>). And it is said accordingly in the Paṭisambhidā: ‘This is a name derived from the final liberation of the Enlightened Ones, the Blessed Ones, together with the acquisition of omniscient knowledge at the root of the Enlightenment Tree; this name “Buddha” is a designation based on realization’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> I 174</span></span><span>). For the ability in the Blessed One’s continuity to penetrate all dhammas without exception was due to his having completely attained to knowledge capable of becoming aware of all dhammas.</span></span><span class="p"><span>“Here it may be asked: But how then? When this knowledge occurs, does it do so with respect to every field simultaneously, or successively? For firstly, if it occurs simultaneously with respect to every objective field, then with the simultaneous appearance of formed dhammas classed as past, future and present, internal and external, etc., and of unformed and conventional (conceptual) dhammas, there would be no awareness of contrast (</span><em>paṭibhāga</em><span>), as happens in one who looks at a painted canvas from a distance. That being so, it follows that all dhammas become the objective field of the Blessed One’s knowledge in an undifferentiated form (</span><em>anirūpita-rūpana</em><span>), as they do through the aspect of not-self to those who are exercising insight thus ’All dhammas are not-self’ (Dhp 279; Th 678; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 230</span></span><span>; II 64; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> III 132</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> I 286</span></span><span>; IV 14; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> II 48</span></span><span>, 62; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vin">Vin</a><span> I 86</span></span><span>. Cf. also </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> III 444</span></span><span>; IV 88, 338; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Sn">Sn</a><span> 1076</span></span><span>). And those do not escape this difficulty who say that the Enlightened One’s knowledge occurs with the characteristic of presence of all knowable dhammas as its objective field, devoid of discriminative thinking (</span><em>vikappa-rahita</em><span>), and universal in time (</span><em>sabba-kāla</em><span>) and that is why they are called ’All-seeing’ and why it is said, ’The Nāga is concentrated walking and he is concentrated standing’ (?).</span></span><span class="p"><span>They do not escape the difficulty since the Blessed One’s knowledge would then have only a partial objective field, because, by having the characteristic of presence as its object, past, future and conventional dhammas, which lack that characteristic, would be absent. So it is wrong to say that it occurs simultaneously with respect to every objective field. Then secondly, if we say that it occurs successively with respect to every objective field, that is wrong too. For when the knowable, classed in the many different ways according to birth, place, individual essence, etc., and direction, place, time, etc., is apprehended successively, then penetration without remainder is not effected since the knowable is infinite. And those are wrong too who say that the Blessed One is All-seeing owing to his doing his defining by taking one part of the knowable as that actually experienced (</span><em>paccakkha</em><span>) and deciding that the rest is the same because of the unequivocalness of its meaning, and that such knowledge is not inferential (</span><em>anumānika</em><span>) since it is free from doubt, because it is what is doubtfully discovered that is meant by inferential knowledge in the world. And they are wrong because there is no such defining by taking one part of the knowable as that actually experienced and deciding that the rest is the same because of the unequivocalness of its meaning, without making all of it actually experienced. For then that ‘rest’ is not actually experienced; and if it were actually experienced, it would no longer be ‘the rest.’</span></span><span class="p"><span>“All that is no argument.—Why not?—Because this is not a field for ratiocination; for the Blessed One has said this: ‘The objective field of Enlightened Ones is unthinkable, it cannot be thought out; anyone who tried to think it out would reap madness and frustration’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> II 80</span></span><span>). The agreed explanation here is this: Whatever the Blessed One wants to know—either entirely or partially—there his knowledge occurs as actual experience because it does so without hindrance. And it has constant concentration because of the absence of distraction. And it cannot occur in association with wishing of a kind that is due to absence from the objective field of something that he wants to know. There can be no exception to this because of the words, ‘All dhammas are available to the adverting of the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, are available at his wish, are available to his attention, are available to his thought’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> II 195</span></span><span>). And the Blessed One’s knowledge that has the past and future as its objective field is entirely actual experience since it is devoid of assumption based on inference, tradition or conjecture.</span></span><span class="p"><span>“And yet, even in that case, suppose he wanted to know the whole in its entirety, then would his knowledge not occur without differentiation in the whole objective field simultaneously? And so there would still be no getting out of that difficulty? “That is not so, because of its purifiedness. Because the Enlightened One’s objective field is purified and it is unthinkable. Otherwise there would be no unthinkableness in the knowledge of the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, if it occurred in the same way as that of ordinary people. So, although it occurs with all dhammas as its object, it nevertheless does so making those dhammas quite clearly defined, as though it had a single dhamma as its object. This is what is unthinkable here. ‘</span></span><span class="p"><span>There is as much knowledge as there is knowable, there is as much knowable as there is knowledge; the knowledge is limited by the knowable, the knowable is limited by the knowledge’ (Paṭis II l95). So he is Fully Enlightened because he has rightly and by himself discovered all dhammas together and separately, simultaneously and successively, according to his wish’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 190–191</span></span><span>).</span></span></span></p></section><section class="sect-dp4"><h1><span>Endowed With Clear Vision and Virtuous Conduct</span></h1><p id="VII.30" class="vism-para"><strong>§30. </strong><span>He is endowed with [clear] vision and [virtuous] conduct: </span><em>vijjācaraṇasampanno = vijjāhi caraṇena ca sampanno</em><span> (resolution of compound). </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[252|194]</span><span>Herein, as to [</span><em>clear] vision</em><span>: there are three kinds of clear vision and eight kinds of clear vision.

This concept of the cosmos, in its general form, is not peculiar to Buddhism, but appears to have been the already generally accepted one. The term </span><em>loka-dhātu</em><span> (world-element), in its most restricted sense, is one world-sphere, but it can be extended to mean any number, for example, the set of world-spheres dominated by a particular Brahmā (see MN 120).</span></span><span class="p"><span>As thus conceived, a circle of “world-sphere mountains” “like the rim of a wheel” (</span><em>cakka—</em><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 198</span></span><span>) encloses the ocean. In the centre of the ocean stands Mount Sineru (or Meru), surrounded by seven concentric rings of mountains separated by rings of sea. In the ocean between the outermost of these seven rings and the enclosing “world-sphere mountain” ring are the “four continents.”</span></span><span class="p"><span>“Over forty-two thousand leagues away” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhs-a">Dhs-a</a><span> 313</span></span><span>) the moon and the sun circulate above them inside the world-sphere mountain ring, and night is the effect of the sun’s going behind Sineru. The orbits of the moon and sun are in the sense-sphere heaven of the Four Kings (</span><em>Catumahārājā</em><span>), the lowest heaven, which is a layer extending from the world-sphere mountains to the slopes of Sineru. The stars are on both sides of them (Dhs-a 318). Above that come the successive layers of the other five sense-sphere heavens—the four highest not touching the earth—and above them the fine-material Brahmā-worlds, the higher of which extend over more than one world-sphere (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> V 59</span></span><span>). The world-sphere rests on water, which rests on air, which rests on space. World-spheres “lie adjacent to each other in contact like bowls, leaving a triangular unlit space between each three” (Vism-mhṭ 199), called a “world-interspace” (see too </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> IV 178</span></span><span>). Their numbers extend thus in all four directions to infinity on the supporting water’s surface.</span></span><span class="p"><span>The southern continent of Jambudīpa is the known inhabited world (but see e.g. DN 26). Various hells (see e.g. MN 130; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> V 173</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vin">Vin</a><span> III 107</span></span><span>) are below the earth’s surface. The lowest sensual-sphere heaven is that of the Deities of the Four Kings</span></span><span class="p"><span>(</span><em>Cātumahārājika</em><span>). The four are Dhataraṭṭha Gandhabba-rāja (King of the East), Virūḷha Kumbhaṇḍa-rāja (King of the South), Virūpaka Nāga-rāja (King of the West), and Kuvera or Vessavaṇa Yakkha-rāja (King of the North—see DN 32). Here the moon and sun circulate. The deities of this heaven are often at war with the Asura demons (see e.g. </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D">D</a><span> II 285</span></span><span>) for possession of the lower slopes of Sineru. The next higher is Tāvatiṃsa (the Heaven of the Thirty-three), governed by Sakka, Ruler of Gods (</span><em>sakka-devinda</em><span>). Above this is the heaven of the Yāma Deities (Deities who have Gone to Bliss) ruled by King Suyāma (not to be confused with Yama King of the Underworld—see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> III 179</span></span><span>). Higher still come the Deities of the Tusita (Contented) Heaven with King Santusita. The fifth of these heavens is that of the Nimmānarati Deities (Deities who Delight in Creating) ruled by King Sunimmita. The last and highest of the sensual-sphere heavens is the Paranimmitavasavatti Heaven (Deities who Wield Power over Others’ Creations). Their king is Vasavatti (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> I 227</span></span><span>; for details see Vibh-a 519f.).

(2) </span><em>Concept of the non-existent</em><span>, which is, for example, the conceptualizing of “female,” “male,” “persons,” etc., which are non-existent by that standard and are only established by means of current speech in the world; similarly “such impossibilities as concepts of a fifth truth or the other sectarians’ Atom, Primordial Essence, World Soul, and the like.” (3) </span><em>Concept of the non-existent based on the existent</em><span>, e.g. the expression, “One with the three clear-visions,” where the “person” (“one”) is nonexistent and the “clear-visions” are existent. (4)</span><em> Concept of the existent based on the non-existent</em><span>, e.g. the “female form,” “visible form” (= visible datum base) being existent and “female” non-existent. (5) </span><em>Concept of the existent</em><span> based on the existent, e.g. “eye-contact,” both “eye” and “contact” being existent.

Under the latter heading this would be a “concept of the nonexistent.” (2) </span><em>Appositional concept</em><span> (</span><em>upa-nidhā-p</em><span>.): many varieties are listed, namely, apposition of reference (“second” as against “first,” “third” as against “second,” “long” as against “short”); apposition of what is in the hand (“umbrella-in-hand,” “knife-in-hand”); apposition of association (“earring-wearer,” “topknot-wearer,” “crest-wearer”); apposition of contents (“corn-wagon,” “ghee-pot”); apposition of proximity (“Indasālā Cave,” “Piyaṅgu Cave”); apposition of comparison (“golden coloured,” “with a bull’s gait”); apposition of majority (“Padumassara-brahman Village”); apposition of distinction (“diamond ring”); and so on. (3) </span><em>Collective concept </em><span>(</span><em>samodhāna-p</em><span>.), e.g., “eight-footed,” “pile of riches.” (4) </span><em>Additive concept</em><span> (</span><em>upanikkhitta-p</em><span>.), e.g. “one,” “two,” “three.” (5) </span><em>Verisimilar concept</em><span> (</span><em>tajjā-p</em><span>.): refers to the individual essence of a given dhamma, e.g. “earth,” “fire,” “hardness,” “heat.” (6) </span><em>Continuity concept</em><span> (</span><em>santati-p</em><span>.): refers to the length of continuity of life, e.g. “octogenarian,” “nonagenarian.”</span></span><span class="p"><span>In the second set there are: (i) </span><em>Concept according to function</em><span> (</span><em>kicca-p</em><span>.), e.g. “preacher,” “expounder of Dhamma.” (ii) </span><em>Concept according to shape</em><span> (</span><em>saṇṭhāna-p.</em><span>), e.g. “thin,” “stout,” “round,” “square.” (iii) </span><em>Concept according to gender</em><span> (</span><em>liṅga-p</em><span>.), e.g. “female,” “male.” (iv) </span><em>Concept according to location</em><span> (</span><em>bhūmi-p</em><span>.), e.g. “of the sense sphere,” “Kosalan.” (v) </span><em>Concept as proper name</em><span> (</span><em>paccatta-p</em><span>.), e.g. “Tissa,” “Nāga,” “Sumana,” which are making-known (appellations) by mere name-making.

For just as when someone who has no skill climbs a thirty-two-rung ladder using every other step, his body gets exhausted and he falls without completing the climb, so too, one who gives it attention skipping [parts] becomes exhausted in his mind and does not complete the development since he fails to get the satisfaction that ought to be got with successful development.</span></p><p id="VIII.63" class="vism-para"><strong>§63. </strong><em>2.</em><span> Also when he gives attention to it following the serial order, he should do so </span><em>not too quickly</em><span>. For just as when a man sets out on a three-league journey, even if he has already done the journey out and back a hundred times rapidly without taking note of [turnings] to be taken and avoided, though he may finish his journey, he still has to ask how to get there, so too, when the meditator gives his attention to the meditation subject too quickly, though he may reach the end of the meditation subject, it still does not become clear or bring about any distinction. So he should not give his attention to it too quickly.</span></p><p id="VIII.64" class="vism-para"><strong>§64. </strong><em>3.</em><span> And as “not too quickly,” so also </span><em>not too slowly</em><span>. For just as when a man wants to do a three-league journey in one day, if he loiters on the way among trees, rocks, pools, etc., he does not finish the journey in a day and needs two or three to complete it, so too, if the meditator gives his attention to the meditation subject too slowly, he does not get to the end and it does not become a condition for distinction.</span></p><p id="VIII.65" class="vism-para"><strong>§65. </strong><em>4. As to warding off distraction</em><span>: he must ward off [temptation] to drop the meditation subject and to let his mind get distracted among the variety of external objects. For if not, just as when a man has entered on a one-foot-wide cliff path, if he looks about here and there without watching his step, he may miss his footing and fall down the cliff, which is perhaps as high as a hundred men, so too, when there is outward distraction, the meditation subject gets neglected and deteriorates. So he should give his attention to it warding off distraction.</span></p><p id="VIII.66" class="vism-para"><strong>§66. </strong><em>5. As to surmounting the concept</em><span>: this [name-] concept beginning with “head hairs, body hairs” must be surmounted and consciousness established on [the aspect] “repulsive.” For just as when men find a water hole in a forest in a time </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[299|241]</span><span>of drought, they hang up some kind of signal there such as a palm leaf, and people come to bathe and drink guided by the signal, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(245)</span><span> but when the way has become plain with their continual traffic, there is no further need of the signal and they go to bathe and drink there whenever they want, so too, when repulsiveness becomes evident to him as he is giving his attention to the meditation subject through the means of the [name-] concept “head hairs, body hairs,” he must surmount the concept “head hairs, body hairs” and establish consciousness on only the actual repulsiveness.</span></p><p id="VIII.67" class="vism-para"><strong>§67. </strong><em>6. As to successive leaving</em><span>: in giving his attention he should eventually leave out any [parts] that do not appear to him. For when a beginner gives his attention to head hairs, his attention then carries on till it arrives at the last part, that is, urine and stops there; and when he gives his attention to urine, his attention then carries on till it arrives back at the first part, that is, head hairs, and stops there. As he persists in giving his attention thus, some parts appear to him and others do not. Then he should work on those that have appeared till one out of any two appears the clearer. He should arouse absorption by again and again giving attention to the one that has appeared thus.</span></p><p id="VIII.68" class="vism-para"><strong>§68. </strong><span>Here is a simile. Suppose a hunter wanted to catch a monkey that lived in a grove of thirty-two palms, and he shot an arrow through a leaf of the palm that stood at the beginning and gave a shout; then the monkey went leaping successively from palm to palm till it reached the last palm; and when the hunter went there too and did as before, it came back in like manner to the first palm; and being followed thus again and again, after leaping from each place where a shout was given, it eventually jumped on to one palm, and firmly seizing the palm shoot’s leaf spike in the middle, would not leap any more even when shot—so it is with this.</span></p><p id="VIII.69" class="vism-para"><strong>§69. </strong><span>The application of the simile is this. The thirty-two parts of the body are like the thirty-two palms in the grove. The monkey is like the mind. The meditator is like the hunter. The range of the meditator’s mind in the body with its thirty-two parts as object is like the monkey’s inhabiting the palm grove of thirty-two palms. The settling down of the meditator’s mind in the last part after going successively [from part to part] when he began by giving his attention to head hairs is like the monkey’s leaping from palm to palm and going to the last palm, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(246)</span><span> when the hunter shot an arrow through the leaf of the palm where it was and gave a shout. Likewise in the return to the beginning. His doing the preliminary work on those parts that have appeared, leaving behind those that did not appear while, as he gave his attention to them again and again, some appeared to him and some did not, is like the monkey’s being followed and leaping up from each place where a shout is given. The meditator’s repeated attention given to the part that in the end appears the more clearly of any two that have appeared to him and his finally reaching absorption, is like the monkey’s eventually stopping in one palm, firmly seizing the palm shoot’s leaf spike in the middle and not leaping up even when shot.</span></p><p id="VIII.70" class="vism-para"><strong>§70. </strong><span>There is another simile too.

The arousing of absorption by giving attention again and again to that which has appeared the more clearly of two is like the alms-food eater’s getting his bowl full at the first [house] on the third day and then going to the sitting hall and eating.</span></p><p id="VIII.72" class="vism-para"><strong>§72. </strong><em>7.

So too, when a bhikkhu wants to tame his own mind which has long been spoilt by being reared on visible data, etc., as object for its food and drink, he should take it away from visible data, etc., as object and bring it into the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty place and tie it up there to the post of in-breaths and out-breaths with the rope of mindfulness. And so his mind may then dash to and fro when it no longer gets the objects it was formerly </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[320|262]</span><span>used to, but being unable to break the rope of mindfulness and get away, it sits down, lies down, by that object under the influence of access and absorption.

That is why the Blessed One said “gone to the forest,” etc., in pointing out a favourable abode for him.</span></p><p id="VIII.156" class="vism-para"><strong>§156. </strong><span>For the Blessed One is like a master of the art of building sites (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D">D</a><span> I 9</span></span><span>, 12; II 87). </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(270)</span><span> As the master of the art of building sites surveys the proposed site for a town, thoroughly examines it, and then gives his directions, “Build the town here,” and when the town is safely finished, he receives great honour from the royal family, so the Blessed One examines an abode as to its suitability for the meditator, and he directs, “Devote yourself to the meditation subject here,” and later on, when the meditator has devoted himself to the meditation subject and has reached Arahantship and says, “The Blessed One is indeed fully enlightened,” the Blessed One receives great honour.</span></p><p id="VIII.157" class="vism-para"><strong>§157. </strong><span>And this bhikkhu is compared to a leopard.

And here the sign that arises with the breaths as its support is also called ‘in-breath and out-breath.’ (cf. e.g. §206) ‘The establishment (foundation) is mindfulness’: mindfulness is called ‘establishment (foundation)—(</span><em>upaṭṭhāna</em><span>)’ since it approaches (</span><em>upagantvā</em><span>) the object and remains (</span><em>tiṭṭhati</em><span>) there. ‘The contemplation is knowledge’: contemplation of the sign by means of serenity, and contemplation of mentality-materiality by defining with insight the in-breaths and out-breaths and the body, which is their support, as materiality, and the consciousness and the states associated with it as the immaterial (mentality), are knowledge, in other words, awareness of what is actually there (has actually become). ‘The body is the establishment (foundation)’: there is that body, and mindfulness approaches it by making it its object and remains there, thus it is called ‘establishment.’ And the words ‘the body is the establishment’ include the other (the mental) kind of body too since the above-mentioned comprehension by insight is needed here too. ‘But it is not the mindfulness’: that body is not called ‘mindfulness’ [though it is called ‘the establishment’]. ‘Mindfulness is both the establishment (foundation) and the mindfulness,’ being so both in the sense of remembering (</span><em>sarana</em><span>) and in the sense of establishing (</span><em>upatiṭṭhana</em><span>). ‘By means of that mindfulness’: by means of that mindfulness already mentioned. ‘And that knowledge’: and the knowledge already mentioned. ‘That body’: that in-breath-and-out-breath body and that material body which is its support. ‘He contemplates (</span><em>anupassati</em><span>)’: he keeps re-seeing (</span><em>anu anu passati</em><span>) with jhāna knowledge and with insight knowledge. ‘That is why “Development of the foundation (establishment) of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body” is said’: in virtue of that contemplation this is said to be development of the foundation (establishment) of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body of the kind already stated. What is meant is this: the contemplation of the body as an in-breath-and-out-breath body as stated and of the physical body that is its [material] support, which is not contemplation of permanence, etc., in a body whose individual essence is impermanent, etc.—like the contemplation of a waterless mirage as water—but which is rather contemplation of its essence as impermanent, painful, not-self, and foul, according as is appropriate, or alternatively, which is contemplation of it as a mere body only, by not contemplating it as containing anything that can be apprehended as ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘woman’ or ‘man’—all this is ‘contemplation of the body.’ The mindfulness associated with that contemplation of the body, which mindfulness is itself the establishment, is the ‘establishment.’ The development, the increase, of that is the ‘development of the foundation (establishment) of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body.’” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 261</span></span><span>)</span></span><span class="p"><span>The compound </span><em>satipaṭṭhāna</em><span> is derived by the Paṭisambhidā from </span><em>sati</em><span> (mindfulness) and </span><em>upaṭṭhāna</em><span> (establishment—</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> I 182</span></span><span>), but in the Commentaries the resolution into </span><em>sati</em><span> and </span><em>paṭṭhāna</em><span> (foundation) is preferred.

They get stronger; his nostrils become inadequate, and he keeps breathing in and out through his mouth. But they become quiet and still when his body and mind have been discerned.

And when counting, he should not stop short of five or go beyond ten or make any break in the series. By stopping short of five his thoughts get excited in the cramped space, like a herd of cattle shut in a cramped pen. By going beyond ten his thoughts take the number [rather than the breaths] for their support. By making a break in the series he wonders if the meditation subject has reached completion or not.

For a grain measurer, having filled his measure, says “One,” and empties it, and then refilling it, he goes on saying ‘”One, one” while removing any rubbish he may have noticed. And the same with “Two, two” and so on. So, taking the in-breath or the out-breath, whichever appears [most plainly], he should begin with “One, one” </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(279)</span><span> and count up to “Ten, ten,” noting each as it occurs.</span></p><p id="VIII.192" class="vism-para"><strong>§192. </strong><span>As he does his counting in this way, the in-breaths and out-breaths become evident to him as they enter in and issue out. Then he can leave off counting slowly (late), like a grain measurer, and he can count quickly [that is, early] as a cowherd does. For a skilled cowherd takes pebbles in his pocket and goes to the cow pen in the morning, whip in hand; sitting on the bar of the gate, prodding the cows in the back, he counts each one as it reaches the gate, saying “One, two,” dropping a pebble for each. And the cows of the herd, which have been spending the three watches of the night uncomfortably in the cramped space, come out quickly in parties, jostling each other as they escape. So he counts quickly (early) “Three, four, five” and so up to ten. In this way the in-breaths and out-breaths, which had already become evident to him while he counted them in the former way, now keep moving along quickly.</span></p><p id="VIII.193" class="vism-para"><strong>§193. </strong><span>Then, knowing that they keep moving along quickly, not apprehending them either inside or outside [the body], but apprehending them just as they reach the [nostril] door, he can do his counting quickly (early): “One, two, three, four, five; one, two, three, four, five, six … seven … eight … nine … ten.” For as long as the meditation subject is connected with counting it is with the help of that very counting that the mind becomes unified, just as a boat in a swift current is steadied with the help of a rudder.</span></p><p id="VIII.194" class="vism-para"><strong>§194. </strong><span>When he counts quickly, the meditation subject becomes apparent to him as an uninterrupted process. Then, knowing that it is proceeding uninterruptedly, he can count quickly (early) in the way just described, not discerning the wind either inside or outside [the body].

The bhikkhu should recognize the unmanifest state of the meditation subject and consider thus: “Where do these in-breaths and out-breaths exist? Where do they not? In whom do they exist?

It is no trivial matter, nor can it be cultivated by trivial persons. In proportion as continued attention is given to it, it becomes more peaceful and more subtle. So strong mindfulness and understanding are necessary here.</span></p><p id="VIII.212" class="vism-para"><strong>§212. </strong><span>Just as when doing needlework on a piece of fine cloth a fine needle is needed, and a still finer instrument for boring the needle’s eye, so too, when developing this meditation subject, which resembles fine cloth, both the mindfulness, which is the counterpart of the needle, and the understanding associated with it, which is the counterpart of the instrument for boring the needle’s eye, need to be strong.

Then after the oxen have wandered about for a part of the day, they come to the drinking place where they meet and they bathe and drink, and when he sees that they have come out and are standing about, he secures them with the rope, and prodding them with the goad, he brings them back, yokes them, and goes on with his ploughing. So too, the bhikkhu should not look for the in-breaths and out-breaths anywhere else than the place normally touched by them.

For dissolution is the furthest extreme of impermanence. So the meditator who is contemplating dissolution by its means sees under the heading of consciousness the whole field of formations as impermanent, not as permanent; and because of the suffering inherent in what is impermanent, and because of the absence of self in what is painful, he sees that same whole field of formations as painful, not as pleasant, and as not-self, not as self. But since what is impermanent, painful, and not-self is not something to delight in, and what is not something to delight in is not something to be greedy for, consequently he becomes dispassionate towards that whole field of formations when it is seen in the light of dissolution as impermanent, painful, not-self, he does not delight in it, and his greed for it fades away, does not dye him. Now, as he thus becomes dispassionate and his greed fades away, it is firstly by means of mundane knowledge only that he causes greed to cease and does not arouse it. The meaning is that he does not bring about its arising. Or alternatively, his greed having thus faded away, he causes by means of his own knowledge the cessation of the unseen field of formations just as that of the seen, he does not arouse it; the meaning is that he brings about only its cessation, he does not bring about its arising. Having entered on this way, he relinquishes, he does not grasp. What is meant? It is that this contemplation of impermanence, etc., is called relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into because it gives up defilements along with aggregate-producing kamma-formations and because, by seeing the flaws in what is formed and by inclining towards the opposite of what is formed, namely Nibbāna, it enters into that Nibbāna. Consequently the meditator who has that contemplation gives up defilements and enters into Nibbāna in the way stated. Herein, the contemplation of what is impermanent as only impermanent is ‘contemplation of impermanence’; this is a name for insight that occurs by taking formations of the three [mundane] planes [and leaving aside the supramundane] as impermanent. ‘From the perception of permanence’: from the wrong perception that occurs perceiving formed things as permanent, eternal; also the various views should be regarded as included under the heading of perception. Likewise with the perception of pleasure and so on. ‘By means of the contemplation of dispassion’: by means of the contemplation that occurs in the mode of dispassion for formations. ‘From delight’: from craving accompanied by happiness. ‘By means of the contemplation of fading away’: by means of the contemplation that occurs similarly in the mode of fading away; hence ‘delivering from greed’ is said. ‘By means of the contemplation of cessation’: by means of the successive seeing of formations’ cessation. Or contemplating cessation is contemplation such that formations cease only and do not arise with future renewal. For this is knowledge of desire for deliverance grown strong. Hence he said, ‘delivering from arousing.’ Contemplation that occurs in the mode of relinquishing is ‘contemplation of relinquishment.’ ‘From grasping’: from taking as permanent, etc.; or the meaning can also here be regarded as ‘from grasping rebirth-linking.’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 279</span></span><span>) See Chapters XX and XXI.</span></span></span><span> ’” So this tetrad should be understood to deal with contemplation of mind.</span></p></section><section class="sect-dp4"><h1><span>Word Commentary Continued—Fourth Tetrad</span></h1><p id="VIII.234" class="vism-para"><strong>§234. </strong><span class="vism-page-bps">[341|283]</span><span>(xiii) But in the fourth tetrad, as to </span><em>contemplating impermanence</em><span>, here firstly, the impermanent should be understood, and impermanence, and the contemplation of impermanence, and one contemplating impermanence.</span></p><p><span>Herein, the five aggregates are </span><em>the impermanent</em><span>.

Relinquishment itself as [a way of] contemplation is “contemplation of relinquishment.” For insight is called both “relinquishment as giving up” and “relinquishment as entering into” since [firstly], through substitution of opposite qualities, it gives up defilements with their aggregate-producing kamma formations, and [secondly], through seeing the wretchedness of what is formed, it also enters into Nibbāna by inclining towards Nibbāna, which is the opposite of the formed (</span><a href="#XI.18">XI.18</a><span>). Also the path is called both “relinquishment as giving up” and “relinquishment as entering into” since it gives up defilements with their aggregate-producing kamma-formations by cutting them off, and it enters into Nibbāna by making it its object. Also both [insight and path knowledge] are called contemplation (</span><em>anupassanā</em><span>) because of their re-seeing successively (</span><em>anu anu passanā</em><span>) each preceding kind of knowledge.</span><span id="VIII.n68" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“The act of relinquishing as the act of giving up by means of substituting for what should be abandoned its opposite quality or by cutting it off, is ‘relinquishment as giving up.’ Likewise the act of relinquishing of self that takes place in non-formation of kamma, which is the relinquishing of all substrata (circumstances) of becoming, being the entering into that [Nibbāna] either by inclination towards it [in insight] or by having it as object [in the path] is ‘relinquishment as entering into.’ ‘Through substitution of opposite qualities’: here contemplation of impermanence, firstly, gives up perception of permanence by abandoning through substitution of the opposite [e.g. substituting perception of impermanence for that of permanence in the case of all formed things]. And the giving up in this way is in the form of inducing non-occurrence. For all kamma-formations that are rooted in defilements due to apprehending (formations) as permanent, and the kamma-resultant aggregates rooted in both which might arise in the future, are abandoned by causing their non-occurrence. Likewise in the case of perception of pain, and so on. ‘Through seeing the wretchedness of what is formed’: through seeing the fault of impermanence, etc., in the formed three-plane field of formations. It is ‘the opposite of the formed’ owing to its permanence, and so on. When defilements are given up by the path, then kamma-formations are called ‘given up’ through producing (</span><em>āpādana</em><span>) in them the nature of not causing result, and aggregates rooted in them are called ‘given up’ through their being rendered fit for non-arising.

Hence it is said: “Mindfulness of breathing should be developed in order to cut off applied thoughts” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> IV 353</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="VIII.239" class="vism-para"><strong>§239. </strong><span>Also its great beneficialness should be understood as the root condition for the perfecting of clear vision and deliverance; for this has been said by the Blessed One: “Bhikkhus, mindfulness of breathing, when developed and much practiced, perfects the four foundations of mindfulness. The four foundations of mindfulness, when developed and much practiced, perfect the seven enlightenment factors. The seven enlightenment factors, when developed and much practiced, perfect clear vision and deliverance” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> III 82</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="VIII.240" class="vism-para"><strong>§240. </strong><span>Again its great beneficialness should be understood to reside in the fact that it causes the final in-breaths and out-breaths to be known; for this is said by the Blessed One: “Rāhula, when mindfulness of breathing is thus developed, thus practiced much, the final in-breaths and out-breaths, too, are known as they cease, not unknown” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 425f.</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="VIII.241" class="vism-para"><strong>§241. </strong><span>Herein, there are three kinds of [breaths that are] final because of cessation, that is to say, final in becoming, final in jhāna, and final in death.

He knows, “My vital formations will continue now for so long and no more.” Automatically he performs all the functions of attending to the body, dressing and robing, etc., after which he closes his eyes, like the Elder Tissa who lived at the Koṭapabbata Monastery, like the Elder Mahā Tissa who lived at the Mahā Karañjiya Monastery, like the Elder Tissa the alms-food eater in the kingdom of Devaputta, like the elders who were brothers and lived at the Cittalapabbata monastery.</span></p><p id="VIII.244" class="vism-para"><strong>§244. </strong><span>Here is one story as an illustration.

Of space (</span><em>ākāsa</em><span>) the </span><em>Majjhima Nikāya Ṭīkā</em><span> says: “Space, which is quite devoid of individual essence, is called empty” (commenting on MN 106), while of time (</span><em>kāla</em><span>) the </span><em>Mūla Ṭīkā </em><span>says: “Though time is determined by the kind of consciousness [e.g. as specified in the first paragraph of the Dhammasaṅgaṇī] and is non-existent (</span><em>avijjamāna</em><span>) as to individual essence, yet as the non-entity (</span><em>abhāva</em><span>) before and after the moment in which those [conascent and co-present] dhammas occur, it is called the ‘container (</span><em>adhikaraṇa</em><span>)’; it is perceived (symbolized) only as the state of a receptacle (</span><em>ādhāra-bhāva</em><span>) (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhs-a">Dhs-a</a><span> 62</span></span><span>). Of Nibbāna (for which see </span><a href="#XVI.46">XVI.46ff.</a><span>), which has its own individual essence, the </span><em>Mūla Ṭīkā</em><span> says “Nibbāna is not like other dhammas; because of its extreme profundity it cannot be made an object of consciousness (</span><em>ālambituṃ</em><span>) by one who has not realized it. That is why it has to be realized by change-of-lineage. It has profundity surpassing any individual essence belonging to the three periods of time” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh-a">Vibh-a</a><span> 38</span></span><span>).</span></span><span class="p"><em>Sabhāva</em><span> has not the extreme vagueness of its parent </span><em>bhāva,</em><span> which can mean anything between “essence” (see e.g. </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhs-a">Dhs-a</a><span> 61</span></span><span>) and “-ness” (e.g. </span><em>natthibhāva</em><span> = non-existingness—</span><a href="#X.35">X.35</a><span>). This may be remembered when </span><em>sabhāva</em><span> is defined as above thus: “It is with essence (</span><em>sahabhāvena</em><span>), thus it is individual essence (</span><em>sabhāva</em><span>)” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 282</span></span><span>), and when it is defined again thus: “A dhamma’s own essence or its existing essence (</span><em>sako vā bhāvo samāno vā bhāvo</em><span>) is its individual essence (</span><em>sabhāva</em><span>)” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 433</span></span><span>). </span><em>Sabhāva </em><span>can also be the basis of a wrong view, if regarded as the sole efficient cause or condition of any formed thing (</span><a href="#XVI.n23">Ch.

The Sanskrit equivalent, </span><em>svabhāva</em><span>, had a great vogue and checkered history in philosophical discussions on the Indian mainland.</span></span><span class="p"><span>This (unlike the word, </span><em>dhamma,</em><span> which has many “referents”) is an instance in which it is of first importance to stick to one rendering. The word is a purely exegetical one; consequently vagueness is undesirable. “Individual essence” has been chosen principally on etymological grounds, and the word “essence” (an admittedly slippery customer) must be understood from the contexts in which it is used and not prejudged. Strictly it refers here to the triple moment of arising etc., of formed dhammas that can have such “existence” in their own right and be experienced as such; and it refers to the realizability of Nibbāna. We are here in the somewhat magical territory of ontology, a subject that is at present undergoing one of its periodical upheavals in Europe, this time in the hands of the existentialists. Consequently it is important to approach the subject with an open mind.</span></span></span><span> </span><em>Whether formed or unformed</em><span>: whether made by conditions going </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[346|288]</span><span>together, coming together, or not so made.</span><span id="VIII.n70" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“‘Made’ is generated. ‘Not so made’ is not made by any conditions at all.” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 281</span></span><span>)</span></span></span><span> </span><em>Fading away is pronounced the best of them</em><span>: of these formed and unformed dhammas, fading away is pronounced the best, is called the foremost, the highest.</span></p><p id="VIII.247" class="vism-para"><strong>§247. </strong><span>Herein </span><em>fading away </em><span>is not mere absence of greed, but rather it is that unformed dhamma which, while given the names “disillusionment of vanity,” etc., in the clause, “that is to say, the disillusionment of vanity, … Nibbāna,” is treated basically as </span><em>fading away</em><span>.</span><span id="VIII.n71" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“That dhamma possessing individual essence and having the characteristic of being not formed is to be treated basically as ‘fading away,’ since it is there that the dhamma of defilement fades away” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 282</span></span><span>).</span></span></span><span> It is called </span><em>disillusionment of vanity</em><span> because on coming to it all kinds of vanity (intoxication), such as the vanity of conceit, and vanity of manhood, are disillusioned, undone, done away with.</span><span id="VIII.n72" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“When they are being abandoned by the noble path, which occurs by making Nibbāna its object, it is said that they are abandoned by reaching that [Nibbāna] which is why he said, ‘Because on coming to it,’ and so on.

By analogy it was extended to the extinction of the five-aggregate process on the Arahant’s death (see It 38). Nibbāna is not the “extinction of a self or of a living lasting being,” such a mistaken opinion being the annihilation view (see e.g. </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 140</span></span><span>, </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> III 109</span></span><span>).</span></span></span><span> </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(294)</span></p><p id="VIII.248" class="vism-para"><strong>§248. </strong><span>This is how peace, in other words, Nibbāna, should be recollected according to its special qualities beginning with disillusionment of vanity.

So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described under the recollection of the Enlightened One, etc., the jhāna factors arise in a single moment. But owing to the profundity of the special qualities of peace, or owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of various kinds, the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption.

They are loving-kindness, compassion, gladness and equanimity. A meditator, who wants to develop firstly loving-kindness among these, if he is a beginner, should sever the impediments and learn the meditation subject. Then, when he has done the work connected with the meal and got rid of any dizziness due to it, he should seat himself comfortably on a well-prepared seat in a secluded place. To start with, he should review the danger in hate and the advantage in patience.</span></p><p id="IX.2" class="vism-para"><strong>§2. </strong><span>Why? Because hate has to be abandoned and patience attained in the development of this meditation subject, and he cannot abandon unseen dangers and attain unknown advantages.</span></p><p><span>Now, the danger in hate should be seen in accordance with such suttas as this: “Friends, when a man hates, is a prey to hate and his mind is obsessed by hate, he kills living things, and …” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> I 216</span></span><span>). And the advantage in patience should be understood according to such suttas as these:</span></p><div class="vism-verse"><div><span>“No higher rule, the Buddhas say, than patience,</span></div><div><span>And no Nibbāna higher than forbearance” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D">D</a><span> II 49</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhp">Dhp</a><span> 184</span></span><span>);</span></div></div><div class="vism-verse"><div><span>“Patience in force, in strong array:</span></div><div><span>’Tis him I call a brahman” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhp">Dhp</a><span> 399</span></span><span>);</span></div></div><div class="vism-verse"><div><span>“No greater thing exists than patience” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> I 222</span></span><span>).</span></div></div><p id="IX.3" class="vism-para"><strong>§3. </strong><span>Thereupon he should embark upon the development of loving-kindness for the purpose of secluding the mind from hate seen as a danger and introducing it to patience known as an advantage.</span></p><p><span>But when he begins, he must know that some persons are of the wrong sort at the very beginning and that loving-kindness should be developed towards certain kinds of persons and not towards certain other kinds at first. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(296)</span></p><p id="IX.4" class="vism-para"><strong>§4. </strong><span>For loving-kindness should not be developed at first towards the following four kinds of persons: an antipathetic person, a very dearly loved friend, a neutral person, and a hostile person. Also it should not be developed specifically (see </span><a href="#IX.49">§49</a><span>) towards the opposite sex, or towards a dead person.</span></p><p id="IX.5" class="vism-para"><strong>§5. </strong><span class="vism-page-bps">[350|292]</span><span>What is the reason why it should not be developed at first towards an antipathetic person and the others? To put an antipathetic person in a dear one’s place is fatiguing. To put a very dearly loved friend in a neutral person’s place is fatiguing; and if the slightest mischance befalls the friend, he feels like weeping. To put a neutral person in a respected one’s or a dear one’s place is fatiguing. Anger springs up in him if he recollects a hostile person. That is why it should not be developed at first towards an antipathetic person and the rest.</span></p><p id="IX.6" class="vism-para"><strong>§6. </strong><span>Then, if he develops it specifically towards the opposite sex, lust inspired by that person springs up in him. An elder supported by a family was asked, it seems, by a friend’s son, “Venerable sir, towards whom should loving-kindness be developed?” The elder told him, “Towards a person one loves.” He loved his own wife. Through developing loving-kindness towards her he was fighting against the wall all the night.</span><span id="IX.n1" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“‘Fighting against the wall’: having undertaken the precepts of virtue and sat down on a seat in his room with the door locked, he was developing loving-kindness. Blinded by lust arisen under cover of the loving-kindness, he wanted to go to his wife, and without noticing the door he beat on the wall in his desire to get out even by breaking the wall down” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 286</span></span><span>).</span></span></span><span> That is why it should not be developed specifically towards the opposite sex.</span></p><p id="IX.7" class="vism-para"><strong>§7. </strong><span>But if he develops it towards a dead person, he reaches neither absorption nor access. A young bhikkhu, it seems, had started developing loving-kindness inspired by his teacher. His loving-kindness made no headway at all. He went to a senior elder and told him, “Venerable sir, I am quite familiar with attaining jhāna through loving-kindness, and yet I cannot attain it. What is the matter?” The elder said, “Seek the sign, friend, [the object of your meditation].” He did so. Finding that his teacher had died, he proceeded with developing loving-kindness inspired by another and attained absorption. That is why it should not be developed towards one who is dead.</span></p><p id="IX.8" class="vism-para"><strong>§8. </strong><span>First of all it should be developed only towards oneself, doing it repeatedly thus: “May I be happy and free from suffering” or “May I keep myself free from enmity, affliction and anxiety and live happily.”</span></p><p id="IX.9" class="vism-para"><strong>§9. </strong><span>If that is so, does it not conflict with what is said in the texts? For there is no mention of any development of it towards oneself in what is said in the Vibhaṅga: “And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart filled with loving-kindness? Just as he would feel loving-kindness on seeing a dearly loved person, so he pervades all beings with loving-kindness” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh">Vibh</a><span> 272</span></span><span>); and in what is said in the Paṭisambhidā: “In what five ways is the mind-deliverance of loving-kindness [practiced] with unspecified pervasion? May all beings be free from enmity, affliction and anxiety and live happily. May all breathing things </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(297)</span><span> … all who are born … all persons … all those who have a personality be free from enmity, affliction and anxiety and live happily” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> II 130</span></span><span>); and in what is said in the Mettā Sutta: “In joy and safety may all beings be joyful at heart” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Sn">Sn</a><span> 145</span></span><span>). [Does it not conflict with those texts?]</span></p><p id="IX.10" class="vism-para"><strong>§10. </strong><span class="vism-page-bps">[351|293]</span><span>It does not conflict. Why not? Because that refers to absorption. But this [initial development towards oneself] refers to [making oneself] an example. For even if he developed loving-kindness for a hundred or a thousand years in this way, “I am happy” and so on, absorption would never arise. But if he develops it in this way: “I am happy. Just as I want to be happy and dread pain, as I want to live and not to die, so do other beings, too,” making himself the example, then desire for other beings’ welfare and happiness arises in him. And this method is indicated by the Blessed One’s saying:</span></p><div class="vism-verse"><div><span>I visited all quarters with my mind</span></div><div><span>Nor found I any dearer than myself;</span></div><div><span>Self is likewise to every other dear;</span></div><div><span>Who loves himself will never harm another (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> I 75</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Ud">Ud</a><span> 47</span></span><span>).</span></div></div><p id="IX.11" class="vism-para"><strong>§11. </strong><span>So he should first, as example, pervade himself with loving-kindness.

And also if he thinks, “Let them take me but not these three,” he has not broken down the barriers either. Why? Because he seeks the harm of him whom he wishes to be taken and seeks the welfare of the other only.

Also attention given to beings is only fourfold, that is to say, as bringing welfare, as removing suffering, as being glad at their success, and as unconcern, [that is to say, impartial neutrality]. And one abiding in the measureless states should practice loving-kindness and the rest like a mother with four sons, namely, a child, an invalid, one in the flush of youth, and one busy with his own affairs; for she wants the child to grow up, wants the invalid to get well, wants the one in the flush of youth to enjoy for long the benefits of youth, and is not at all bothered about the one who is busy with his own affairs.

Why? Because they are not dissociated from </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[374|316]</span><span>joy. But why are their aims not dissociated from joy? Because they are the escape from ill will, etc., which are originated by grief. But the last one belongs only to the remaining single jhāna. Why? Because it is associated with equanimous feeling.

But the Blessed One had no confidence yet in that bhikkhu, since although he had already heard the Dhamma he had nevertheless gone on living there instead of going to do the ascetic’s duties, [and the Blessed One expressed his lack of confidence] thus: “So too, some misguided men merely question me, and when the Dhamma is expounded [to them], they still fancy that they need not follow me” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> IV 299</span></span><span>). However, the bhikkhu had the potentiality for the attainment of Arahantship, and so he advised him again, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(323)</span><span> saying: “Therefore, bhikkhu, you should train thus: ‘My mind shall be steadied, quite steadied internally, and arisen evil unprofitable things shall not obsess my mind and </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[375|317]</span><span>remain.’ You should train thus” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> IV 299</span></span><span>).

When it has reached its culmination, it makes beings its object by simply looking on. So its occurrence is specially occupied with what is non-existent in the ultimate sense [i.e. beings, which are a concept].

This is what he told the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the inhabitants of Jambudīpa pay homage at the Blessed One’s feet, and they say, ‘We will disperse when we have seen the Blessed One.’” The Blessed One said, “But, Moggallāna, where is your elder brother, the General of the Dhamma?”—“At the city of Saṅkassa, venerable sir.”—“Moggallāna, those who wish to see me should come tomorrow to the city of Saṅkassa.

And he saw right down to Avīci, and up to the Realm of the Highest Gods. That day, it seems, was called the day of the Revelation of Worlds (</span><em>loka-vivaraṇa</em><span>).

And when he was asked, “Have you seen the king, venerable sir?,” he asked, But which is better for you, to seek the king or to seek [your] self?” (cf. </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vin">Vin</a><span> I 23</span></span><span>). She replied, “[My] self, venerable sir.” Then he likewise taught her the Dhamma as she sat there, so that, together with the thousand women attendants, she became established in the fruition of stream-entry, while the ministers reached the fruition of non-return, and the king that of Arahantship (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A-a">A-a</a><span> I 322</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhp-a">Dhp-a</a><span> II 124</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XII.83" class="vism-para"><strong>§83. </strong><span>Furthermore, this was performed by the Elder Mahinda, who so acted on the day of his arrival in Tambapaṇṇi Island that the king did not see the others who had come with him (see </span><em>Mahāvaṃsa</em><span> I 103).</span></p><p id="XII.84" class="vism-para"><strong>§84. </strong><span>Furthermore, all miracles of making evident are called an appearance, and all miracles of making unevident are called a vanishing.

The elder attained the fourth jhāna, and the blast failed to move even a single hair on his body. The other bhikkhus would, it seems, have been able to perform all the miracles up to now, but at this point they could not have attained with so rapid a response, which is why the Blessed One would not allow them to tame the royal nāga.</span></p><p id="XII.115" class="vism-para"><strong>§115. </strong><span>The royal nāga thought, “I have been unable to move even a single hair on this monk’s body with the blast from my nose.

Anāthapiṇḍika said, “Venerable sir, why have you come so late?”—“There was a battle between Moggallāna and Nandopananda.”—“Who won, venerable sir? Who was defeated?”—“Moggallāna won; Nanda was defeated.” Anāthapiṇḍika said, “Venerable sir, let the Blessed One consent to my providing meals for seven days in a single series, and to my honouring the elder for seven days.” Then for seven days he accorded great honour to the five hundred bhikkhus with the Enlightened One at their head.</span></p><p id="XII.117" class="vism-para"><strong>§117. </strong><span>So it was with reference to this enlarged form created during this taming of Nandopananda that it was said: “When he makes his body big, does it not then become big, as in the case of the Elder Mahā Moggallāna?” (</span><a href="#XII.105">§105</a><span>).

Consequently, enlargement should be understood only in the way stated.

Herein, just as when a pint measure (</span><em>āḷhaka</em><span>) of milk is poured into a number of pints of water, though the milk becomes completely mixed up with the water, and is present appreciably in all, it is nevertheless not the milk that has increased there, but only the water. And so too, although the clung-to and unclung-to occur mixed up together, it is nevertheless not the clung-to that is enlarged.

But how does the body, whose going [being that of matter] is slow, come to have the same going as the mind, which quickly passes? Its going is not the same in all respects; for in the case of converting the mind to conform with the body, the mind does not come to have the same going as the body in all respects. For it is not that the mind then occurs with the moment of a material state, which passes slowly, instead of passing with its own kind of moment, which is what establishes its individual essence. But rather the mind is called ‘converted to accord with the going of the body’ as long as it goes on occurring in a continuity that conforms with the body until the desired place is arrived at. This is because its passing occurs parallel with that of the body, whose going is slow, owing to the resolution, ‘Let the mind be like this body.’ And likewise, it is while the body keeps occurring in suchwise that its arrival at the desired place comes about in only a few quick passes of the mind instead of passing slowly, as in those who have not developed the roads to power—and this mode of occurrence is due to the possession of the perception of lightness, to say nothing of the resolve, ‘Let this body be like this mind’—that the body is called ‘converted to accord with the going of the mind,’ not because it arrives at the desired place in a single consciousness moment. And when taken thus the simile, ‘Just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm, or bend his outstretched arm’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vin">Vin</a><span> I 5</span></span><span>) can be taken literally. And this must be accepted in this way without reserve, otherwise there is conflict with the Suttas, the Abhidhamma and the Commentary, as well as contradiction of natural law (</span><em>dhammatā</em><span>). ‘Bhikkhus, I see no other one thing that is so quickly transformed as the mind’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> I 10</span></span><span>)—here it is material states that are referred to by the word ‘other’ because they do not pass quickly.

There is no transmigration to an adjacent location (</span><em>desantara-saṅkamana</em><span>), nor does the individual essence become other.

Here, it goes all round (</span><em>pariyāti</em><span>), thus it is penetration (</span><em>pariya</em><span>); the meaning is that it delimits (</span><em>paricchindati</em><span>). The penetration of the heart (</span><em>cetaso pariyaṃ</em><span>) is “penetration of minds” (</span><em>cetopariya</em><span>). It is penetration of hearts and that is knowledge, thus it is knowledge of penetration of minds (</span><em>cetopariyañāṇa</em><span>). [He directs his consciousness] to that, is what is meant.</span></p><p><em>Of other beings</em><span>: of the rest of beings, himself excluded. </span><em>Of other persons</em><span>: this has the same meaning as the last, the wording being varied to suit those susceptible of teaching [in another way], and for the sake of elegance of exposition. </span><em>With his mind the minds</em><span>: with his [manner of] consciousness the [manner of] consciousness of other beings. </span><em>Having penetrated</em><span> (</span><em>paricca</em><span>): having delimited all round. </span><em>He understands</em><span>: he understands them to be of various sorts beginning with that affected by greed.</span></p><p id="XIII.9" class="vism-para"><strong>§9. </strong><span>But how is this knowledge to be aroused? That is successfully done through the divine eye, which constitutes its preliminary work.

So he should seek out another’s [manner of] consciousness by keeping under observation the colour of the blood in the physical heart thus, “This matter is originated by the joy faculty; this is originated by the grief faculty; this is originated by the equanimity faculty,” and so consolidate his knowledge of penetration of hearts.</span></p><p id="XIII.10" class="vism-para"><strong>§10. </strong><span>It is when it has been consolidated in this way that he can gradually get to understand not only all manner of sense-sphere consciousness but those of fine-material and immaterial consciousness as well by tracing one [manner of] consciousness from another without any more seeing the physical heart’s matter. For this is said in the Commentary: “When he wants to know another’s [manner of] consciousness in the immaterial modes, whose physical-heart matter can he observe? Whose material alteration [originated] by the faculties can he look at? No one’s.

They are like the blind in that they are unable to descend upon any place they choose; they go as the blind do without letting go of their sticks. So they recollect without letting go of the succession of aggregates. Ordinary disciples both recollect by means of the succession of aggregates and trace by means of death and rebirth-linking. Likewise, the eighty great disciples. But the chief disciples have nothing to do with the succession of aggregates. When they see the death of one person, they see the rebirth-linking, and again when they see the death of another, they see the rebirth-linking.

Then he should attain the four jhānas in succession and emerge from the fourth jhāna as basis for direct-knowledge. He should then advert to his most recent act of sitting down [for this purpose], next, to the preparation of the seat, to the entry into the lodging, to the putting away of the bowl and [outer] robe, to the time of eating, to the time of returning from the village, to the time of wandering for alms in the village, to the time of entering the village, to the time of setting out from the monastery, to the time of paying homage at the shrine terrace and the Enlightenment-tree terrace, to the time of washing the bowl, to the time of picking up the bowl, to the things done from the time of picking up the bowl back to the mouth washing, to the things done in the early morning, to the things done in the middle watch, in the first watch.

And this meaning should also be illustrated by means of the wood cutter and the hair-cutter as well.</span></p><p id="XIII.27" class="vism-para"><strong>§27. </strong><span>Herein, the knowledge that occurs making its object the period from the last sitting down for this purpose back to the rebirth-linking is not called knowledge of recollection of past lives; but it is called preliminary-work-concentration knowledge; and some call it “knowledge of the past” (</span><em>atītaṃsa-ñāṇa</em><span>), but that is inappropriate to the fine-material sphere.</span></p><p><span>However, when this bhikkhu has got back beyond the rebirth-linking, there arises in him mind-door adverting making its object the mentality-materiality that occurred at the death moment.

The first of these, called “preliminary-work,” etc., in the way already described (</span><a href="#XIII.5">§5</a><span>), are of the sense sphere.

On the occasion when the aeon is destroyed by fire </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(415)</span><span> first of all a great cloud heralding the aeon’s destruction appears, and there is a great downpour all over the hundred thousand million world-spheres. People are delighted, and they bring out all their seeds and sow them. But when the sprouts have grown enough for an ox to graze, then not a drop of rain falls any more even when the asses bray. Rain is withheld from then on. This is what the Blessed One referred to when he said: “Bhikkhus, an occasion comes when for many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many hundreds of thousands of years, there is no rain” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> IV 100</span></span><span>).

They make this announcement: “Good sirs, good sirs, at the end of a hundred thousand years from now there will be the emergence of an aeon. This world will be destroyed. Even the ocean will dry up.

With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, happy or unhappy in their destiny; he understands beings as faring according to their deeds: ‘These worthy beings who were ill-conducted in body, speech and mind, revilers of Noble Ones, wrong in their views, acquirers of kamma due to wrong view, have, on the breakup of the body, after death, appeared in a state of loss, in an unhappy destiny, in perdition in hell; but these worthy beings, who are well conducted in body, speech and mind, not revilers of Noble Ones, right in their views, acquirers of kamma due to right view, have, on the breakup of the body, after death, appeared in a happy destiny, in the heavenly world.’ Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, happy or unhappy in their destiny; he understands beings as faring according to their deeds” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D">D</a><span> I 82</span></span><span>). Herein,] </span><em>to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance: cutūpapātañāṇāya= cutiyā ca upapāte ca ñāṇāya</em><span> (resolution of compound); [the meaning is,] for the </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[474|416]</span><span>kind of knowledge by means of which beings’ passing away and reappearance is known; for knowledge of the divine eye, is what is meant. </span><em>He directs, he inclines his mind</em><span>: he both directs and inclines preliminary-work consciousness. He is the bhikkhu who does the directing of his mind.</span></p><p id="XIII.73" class="vism-para"><strong>§73. </strong><span>But as regards </span><em>with the divine eye</em><span>, etc., it is </span><em>divine</em><span> because of its similarity to the divine; for deities have as divine eye the sensitivity that is produced by kamma consisting in good conduct and is unimpeded by bile, phlegm, blood, etc., and capable of receiving an object even though far off because it is liberated from imperfections. And this eye, consisting in knowledge, which is produced by the power of this bhikkhu’s energy in development, is similar to that, so it is “divine” because it is similar to the divine. Also it is “divine” because it is obtained by means of divine abiding, and because it has divine abiding as its support. And it is “divine” because it greatly illuminates by discerning light. And it is “divine” because it has a great range through seeing visible objects that are behind walls, and so on. All that should be understood according to the science of grammar. It is an </span><em>eye</em><span> in the sense of seeing. Also it is an eye since it is like an eye in its performance of an eye’s function. It is </span><em>purified</em><span> since it is a cause of purification of view, owing to seeing passing away and reappearance.</span></p><p id="XIII.74" class="vism-para"><strong>§74. </strong><span>One who sees only passing away and not reappearance assumes the annihilation view; and one who sees only reappearance and not passing away assumes the view that a new being appears.

Hence it was said above: </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(424)</span><span> “It is ‘purified’ since it is a cause of purification of view, owing to seeing passing away and reappearance.”</span></p><p id="XIII.75" class="vism-para"><strong>§75. </strong><em>It surpasses the human</em><span> in the seeing of visible objects by surpassing the human environment.

And there is no occurrence of exalted consciousness without adverting and preliminary work. Nor is materiality that is only arising able to serve as object condition, nor that which is dissolving. Therefore, it is rightly said that he cannot see with the divine eye materiality at the moments of death and reappearance. If the knowledge of the divine eye has only materiality as its object, then why is it said that he ‘sees beings’? It is said in this way since it is mainly concerned with instances of materiality in a being’s continuity, or because that materiality is a reason for apprehending beings.

He thought, “This gruel is good for me; I shall drink it before it gets cold.” People brought a wooden stool to the doorstep, and he sat down and drank it. The other was disgusted and remarked, “The old man has let his hunger get the better of him and has done what he should be ashamed to do.” The elder wandered for alms, and on returning to the monastery he asked the young bhikkhu, “Have you any footing in this Dispensation, friend?”—“Yes, venerable sir, I am a stream-enterer.”—“Then, friend, do not try for the higher paths; one whose cankers are destroyed has been reviled by you.” The young bhikkhu asked for the elder’s forgiveness and was thereby restored to his former state.</span></p><p id="XIII.85" class="vism-para"><strong>§85. </strong><span>So one who reviles a Noble One, even if he is one himself, should go to him; if he himself is senior, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(426)</span><span> he should sit down in the squatting position and get his forgiveness in this way, “I have said such and such to the venerable one; may he forgive me.” If he himself is junior, he should pay homage, and sitting in the squatting position and holding out his hand palms together, he should get his forgiveness in this way, “I have said such and such to you, venerable sir; forgive me.” If the other has gone away, he should get his forgiveness either by going to him himself or by sending someone such as a co-resident.</span></p><p id="XIII.86" class="vism-para"><strong>§86. </strong><span>If he can neither go nor send, he should go to the bhikkhus who live in that monastery, and, sitting down in the squatting position if they are junior, or acting in the way already described if they are senior, he should get forgiveness by saying, “Venerable sirs, I have said such and such to the venerable one named so and so; may that venerable one forgive me.” And this should also be done when he fails to get forgiveness in his presence.</span></p><p id="XIII.87" class="vism-para"><strong>§87. </strong><span>If it is a bhikkhu who wanders alone and it cannot be discovered where he is living or where he has gone, he should go to a wise bhikkhu and say, “Venerable sir, I have said such and such to the venerable one named so and so. When I remember it, I am remorseful. What shall I do?” He should be told, “Think no more about it; the elder forgives you.

Then one of these three kasiṇas, that is to say, the fire kasiṇa, white kasiṇa, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(428)</span><span> or light kasiṇa, should be brought to the neighbourhood [of the arising of divine-eye knowledge]. He should make this access jhāna his resort and stop there to extend [the kasiṇa]; the intention is that absorption should not be aroused here; for if he does induce absorption, the [kasiṇa] will become the support for basic jhāna, but not for the [direct-knowledge] preliminary work. The light kasiṇa is the best of the three. So either that, or one of the others, should be worked up in the way stated in the Description of the Kasiṇas, and it should be stopped at the level of access and extended there. And the method for extending it should be understood in the way already described there too. It is only what is visible within the area to which the kasiṇa has been extended that can be seen.</span></p><p id="XIII.96" class="vism-para"><strong>§96. </strong><span>However, while he is seeing what is visible, the turn of the preliminary work runs out. Thereupon the light disappears. When that has disappeared, he no longer sees what is visible (cf. </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> III 158</span></span><span>). Then he should again and again attain the basic jhāna, emerge and pervade with light. In this way the light gradually gets consolidated till at length it remains in whatever sized area has been delimited by him in this way, “Let there be light here.” Even if he sits watching all day he can still see visible objects.</span></p><p id="XIII.97" class="vism-para"><strong>§97. </strong><span>And here there is the simile of the man who set out on a journey by night with a grass torch. Someone set out on a journey by night, it seems, with a grass torch. His torch stopped flaming. Then the even and uneven places were no more evident to him. He stubbed the torch on the ground and it again blazed up. In doing so it gave more light than before. As it went on dying out and flaring up again, eventually the sun rose. When the sun had risen, he thought, “There is no further need of the torch,” and he threw it away and went on by daylight.</span></p><p id="XIII.98" class="vism-para"><strong>§98. </strong><span>Herein, the kasiṇa light at the time of the preliminary work is like the light of the torch. His no more seeing what is visible when the light has disappeared owing to the turn of the preliminary work running out while he is seeing what is visible is like the man’s not seeing the even and uneven places owing to the torch’s stopping flaming. His repeated attaining is like the stubbing of the torch. His more powerful pervasion with light by repeating the preliminary work is like the torch’s giving more light than before. The strong light’s </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[479|421]</span><span>remaining in as large an area as he delimits is like the sun’s rising. His seeing even during a whole day what is visible in the strong light after throwing the limited light away is like the man’s going on by day after throwing the torch away.</span></p><p id="XIII.99" class="vism-para"><strong>§99. </strong><span>Herein, when visible objects that are not within the focus of the bhikkhu’s fleshly eye come into the focus of his eye of knowledge—that is to say, visible objects that are inside his belly, belonging to the heart basis, belonging to what is below the earth’s surface, behind walls, mountains and enclosures, or in another world-sphere—</span><span class="vism-page-pts">(429)</span><span> and are as if seen with the fleshly eye, then it should be understood that the divine eye has arisen. And only that is capable of seeing the visible objects here, not the preliminary-work consciousnesses.</span></p><p id="XIII.100" class="vism-para"><strong>§100. </strong><span>But this is an obstacle for an ordinary man. Why? Because wherever he determines, “Let there be light,” it becomes all light, even after penetrating through earth, sea and mountains. Then fear arises in him when he sees the fearful forms of spirits, ogres, etc., that are there, owing to which his mind is distracted and he loses his jhāna. So he needs to be careful in seeing what is visible (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> III 158</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XIII.101" class="vism-para"><strong>§101. </strong><span>Here is the order of arising of the divine eye: when mind-door adverting, which has made its object that visible datum of the kind already described, has arisen and ceased, then, making that same visible datum the object, all should be understood in the way already described beginning, “Either four or five impulsions impel …” (</span><a href="#XIII.5">§5</a><span>) Here also the [three or four] prior consciousnesses are of the sense sphere and have applied and sustained thought.

What reason do they give? It is that the consciousness of the possessor of supernormal power and that of the other arise in a single moment. Their simile is this: just as when a handful of flowers is thrown into the air, the stalk of one flower is probably struck by the stalk of another, and so too, when with the thought, “I will know another’s mind,” the mind of a multitude is adverted to as a mass, then the mind of one is probably penetrated by the mind of the other either at the moment of arising or at the moment of presence or at the moment of dissolution.</span></p><p id="XIII.116" class="vism-para"><strong>§116. </strong><span>That, however, is rejected in the Commentaries as erroneous, because even if one went on adverting for a hundred or a thousand years, there is never co-presence of the two consciousnesses, that is to say, of that with which he adverts </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[483|425]</span><span>and that [of impulsion] with which he knows, and because the flaw of plurality of objects follows if presence [of the same object] to both adverting and impulsion is not insisted on.

Here is the illustration. The possessor of supernormal-power who wants to know another’s mind adverts. The adverting [consciousness] makes [the other’s consciousness that is] present by moment its object and ceases together with it. After that there are four or five impulsions, of which the last is the supernormal-power consciousness, the rest being of the sense sphere. That same [other’s] consciousness, which has ceased, is the object of all these too, and so they do not have different objects because they have an object that is “present by extent.” And while they have a single object it is only the supernormal-power consciousness that actually knows another’s consciousness, not the others, just as in the eye-door it is only eye-consciousness that actually sees the visible datum, not the others.</span></p><p id="XIII.119" class="vism-para"><strong>§119. </strong><span>So this has a present object in what is present by continuity and what is present by extent. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(433)</span><span> Or since what is present by continuity falls within what is present by extent, it can therefore be understood that it has a present object simply in what is present by extent.</span></p><p><span>It </span><em>has an external object</em><span> because it has only another’s mind as its object.</span></p><p><span>This is how knowledge of penetration of minds should be understood to occur with respect to the eight kinds of objects.</span></p><p id="XIII.120" class="vism-para"><strong>§120. </strong><span>(4) </span><em>Knowledge of past lives</em><span> occurs with respect to eight kinds of object, that is to say, as having a limited, exalted, or measureless object, path as object, a past object, and an internal, external, or not-so-classifiable object.

But when their arising is due to kamma that is one, how does there come to be differentiation among them? It is due to dividedness in the cause too. For it is craving, in the form of longing for this or that kind of becoming that, itself having specific forms owing to hankering after the sense-bases included in some kind of becoming or other, contrives, acting as decisive-support, the specific divisions in the kamma that generates such a kind of becoming. As soon as the kamma has acquired the differentiation induced by that [hankering] it generates through effort consisting in appropriate ability a multiple fruit with differentiated individual essences, as though it had itself taken on a multiple form. And the ability here need not be understood as anything other than the able state; for it is simply the effort of producing fruit that is differentiated by the differentiation due to the differentiation in its cause. And the fact of this differentiating effort on the part of kamma that is one being the cause of the multiple faculties will be dealt with below as to logic and texts (note 21).

That is why the heart-basis is not mentioned, not because it is unapprehendable.</span></span><span class="p"><span>“(ii) But the logical reasoning should be understood in this way. In the five constituent becoming, [that is, in the sense sphere and fine-material sphere,] these two elements have as their support produced </span><em>(nipphanna) </em><span>derived matter. Herein, since the visible-data base, etc., and nutritive essence, are found to occur apart from what is bound up with faculties, to make them the support would be illogical. And since these two elements are found in a continuity that is devoid of the femininity and masculinity faculties [i.e. in the Brahmā-world], to make them the support would be illogical too. And in the case of the life faculty that would have to have another function, so to make it the support would be illogical too. So it is the heart-basis that remains to be recognized as their support. For it is possible to say that these two elements have as their support produced derived matter, since existence is bound up with matter in the five-constituent becoming. Whatever has its existence bound up with matter is found to have as its support produced derived matter, as the eye-consciousness-element does. And the distinction ‘in the five-constituent becoming’ is made on account of the mind-consciousness-element; in the four-constituent becoming, [that is, the immaterial sphere,] there is no mind-element. Does there not follow contradiction of the middle term </span><em>(hetu) </em><span>because of establishing faculties as their support? No; because that is disproved by what is seen. For these two elements are not, as in the case of eye-consciousness, controlled by the slackness and keenness, etc., of their physical basis; and accordingly it is not said in the texts that they have the faculties as their condition. Hence their having faculties as their support, in other words, their being controlled by them, is disproved.</span></span><span class="p"><span>“Granted that these two elements have as their support the derived matter consisting of the heart-basis, how is it to be known that it is kamma-originated, has an invariable function, and is to be found located in the heart? It may be said to be kamma-originated because, like the eye, it is the materiality of a physical basis; and because of that it has an invariable function; because it is the materiality of a physical basis and because it is a support for consciousness, is the meaning. It is known that its location is there because of the heart’s exhaustion </span><em>(khijjana) </em><span>in one who thinks of anything, bringing it to mind intently and directing his whole mind to it” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 449–450</span></span><span>).</span></span><span class="p"><span>The word </span><em>hadaya </em><span>(heart), used in a purely mental and not physical sense, occurs in the definitions of the mind-element and mind-consciousness-element in the Vibhaṅga (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh">Vibh</a><span> 88–89</span></span><span>).

Moving forward, etc., should be understood to occur owing to the movement of the [kinds of matter] that are temperature-born, etc., which are interlocked with the consciousness-born kinds moved by that [intimation]</span><span id="XIV.n27" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“It is the mode and the alteration of what? Of consciousness-originated primary elements that have the air-element in excess of capability. What is that capability? It is the state of being consciousness-born and the state of being derived matter. Or alternatively, it can be taken as the mode alteration of the air element. If that is so, then intimation is illogical as derived matter, for there is no derived matter with a single primary as its support, since ‘matter derived from the four great primaries’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 53</span></span><span>) is said. That is not wrong. Alteration of one of the four is that of all four, as with wealth shared among four. And excess of air element in a material group </span><em>(kalāpa) </em><span>does not contradict the words ‘of the air element’; and excess is in capability, not in quantity, otherwise their inseparability would be illogical. According to some it is that of the air element only. In their opinion the state of derived matter is inapplicable </span><em>(durupapāda) </em><span>to intimation, since the alteration of one is not that of all. But this [air element] is apprehended by mind-door impulsion that is next to the non-intimating [apprehension] that is next to the apprehension of the appearance of motion in the movement of the hands, and so on. There is a certain kind of alteration that is separate from the appearance of motion. And the apprehension of the former is next to the apprehension of the latter. How is that to be known? By the apprehension of intention. For no apprehension of intention such as, ‘He is getting this done, it seems’ is met with in the case of trees’ movements, etc., which are devoid of intention. But it is met with in the case of hand movements and so on. Therefore there is a certain kind of alteration that is separate from the appearance of motion, and it is known as the ‘intimator of the intention.’ Also it is known by inference that the apprehension of the alteration is next to the apprehension of the appearance thus: The intimator intimates the meaning to be intimated only when it is apprehended as a cause, not merely as present. For they say accordingly:</span></span><span class="p"><span>Sounds that have entered no objective field Do not awaken any kind of meaning; And also beings merely recognized As such communicate no meanings either.</span></span><span class="p"><span>“If just the apprehension of the alteration is the reason for the apprehension of the intention, why is there no apprehension of intention in unapprehended communication </span><em>(saṅketa)ī </em><span>It is not only just the apprehension of the alteration that is the reason for the apprehension of the intention; but rather it should be taken that the apprehension of the previously-established connection is the decisive support for this. The stiffening, upholding, and movement are due to the air-element associated with the alteration belonging to the intimation, is what is said. What, is it all the air-element that does all those things? It is not like that. For it is the air element given rise to by the seventh impulsion that, by acquiring as its reinforcing conditions the air elements given rise to by the preceding impulsions, moves consciousness-originated matter by acting as cause for its successive arisings in adjacent locations, </span><em>(desantaruppatti—</em><span>cf. </span><a href="#VIII">Ch. VIII</a><span>, n. 54) not the others. The others, however, help it by doing the stiffening and upholding, the successive arising in adjacent locations being itself the movement. So the instrumentality should be taken as attributed when there is the sign [of movement]; otherwise there would not be uninterestedness and momentariness of dhammas. And here the cart to be drawn by seven yokes is given as simile in the Commentary. But when consciousness-born matter moves, the kinds of matter born of temperature, kamma, and nutriment move too because they are bound up with it, like a piece of dry cow-dung thrown into a river’s current.</span></span><span class="p"><span>“Since it has been said that the apprehension of intimation is next to the apprehension of the appearance of motion, how then, is the air element itself as the maker of the movement accompanied by the alteration consisting in the intimation? It is not like that. It is the air elements given rise to by the first impulsion, etc., and which are unable to cause movement in that way and perform only the stiffening and upholding, that should be taken as only accompanied by the alteration belonging to intimation. For it is the alteration coexistent with the intention that is the intimation, because of giving rise to alteration in whatever direction it wishes to cause the occurrence of moving forward and so on. Taking it in this way, it is perfectly logical to say that the origination of intimation belongs to mind-door adverting. Since the intention possessed of the aforesaid alteration is intimated through the apprehension of that alteration, it is said that ‘Its function is to display intention.’ The air element being the cause of the motion of the bodily intimation, is figuratively said, as a state of alteration, to be ‘manifested as the cause of bodily motion.’ ‘Its proximate cause is the consciousness-originated air-element’ is said since the air element’s excessive function is the cause of intimating intention by movement of the body” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 450–452</span></span><span>).

Because of the unreliability of the sensation of cold, like ‘beyond and not beyond.’ For in hot weather, while those who stand in the sun and go into the shade have the sensation of cold, yet those who go to the same place from an underground cave have the sensation of heat. And if coldness were the water element it would be found in a single group </span><em>(kalāpa) </em><span>along with heat; but it is not so found. That is why it may be known that coldness is not the water element.

For in the ultimate sense it is Nibbāna that is called “the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.” </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[578|520]</span><span>But because craving fades away and ceases on coming to that,</span><span id="XVI.n16" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“‘</span><em>On coming to that </em><span>(</span><em>taṃ āgamma</em><span>)’: on reaching that Nibbāna by making it the object” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 533</span></span><span>). </span><em>Āgamma </em><span>(ger. of </span><em>āgacchati—</em><span>to come) is commonly used as an adverb in the sense of “owing to” (e.g. at </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 119</span></span><span>). Here, however, it is taken literally by the Commentaries and forms an essential part of the ontological proof of the positive existence of Nibbāna. The </span><em>Sammohavinodanī</em><span> (commentary on the Āyatana-Vibhaṅga Abhidhamma-bhājaniya) refutes the suggestion of a disputant (</span><em>vitaṇḍavādin</em><span>) who asserts that Nibbāna is “mere destruction” (</span><em>khayamatta</em><span>). The arguments used are merely supplementary to those in §69 here, and so are not quoted. The conclusion of the argument is worth noting, however, because of the emphasis on the words “</span><em>taṃ āgamma</em><span>.” It is this: “It is on coming to Nibbāna that greed, etc., are destroyed. It is the same Nibbāna that is called ‘destruction of greed, destruction of hate, destruction of delusion.’ These are just three terms for Nibbāna—When this was said, he asked: You say ‘On coming to’ (</span><em>āgamma</em><span>); from where have you got this ‘on coming to’?—It is got from the Suttas—Quote the sutta—‘Thus ignorance and craving, on coming to that, are destroyed in that, are abolished in that, nor does anything anywhere … (</span><em>evaṃ avijjā ca taṇhā ca taṃ āgamma tamhi khīṇaṃ tamhi bhaggaṃ na ca kiñci kadāci</em><span> … ).’ When this was said, the other was silent.” The quotation has not been traced.</span></span></span><span> it is therefore called “fading away” and “cessation.” And because there comes to be the giving up, etc., of that [craving] on coming to that [Nibbāna], and since there is not even one kind of reliance here [to be depended upon] from among the reliances consisting in the cords of sense desires, etc., it is therefore called </span><em>giving it up, relinquishing it, letting it go, not relying on it.</em></p><p id="XVI.66" class="vism-para"><strong>§66. </strong><span>It has peace as its characteristic.

The word </span><em>papañca </em><span>is commonly used in the Commentaries in the sense (a) of an impediment or obstacle (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhp-a">Dhp-a</a><span> I 18</span></span><span>), and (b) as a delay, or diffuseness (</span><a href="#XVII.73">XVII.73</a><span>). The sense in which the word is used in the Suttas is that of diversifying and is best exemplified at </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 111</span></span><span>: “Friends, due to eye and to a visible object eye-consciousness arises. The coincidence of the three is contact. With contact as condition there is feeling. What a man feels that he perceives. What he perceives he thinks about. What he thinks about he diversifies (</span><em>papañceti</em><span>). Owing to his having diversified, the evaluation of diversifying perceptions besets a man with respect to past, future, and present visible objects,” and so on. This kind of </span><em>papañca</em><span> is explained by the Commentaries as “due to craving, pride and views” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> I 25</span></span><span>; II 10; II 75, etc.), and it may be taken as the diversifying action, the choosing and rejecting, the approval and disapproval (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 65</span></span><span>), exercised by craving, etc., on the bare material supplied by perception and thought. Consequently, though it is bound up with craving, etc., a false emphasis is given in rendering </span><em>papañca</em><span> in these contexts by “obsession” as is done in PED. </span><em>Nippapañca</em><span> as a term for Nibbāna emphasizes the absence of that.</span></span></span></p><section class="sect-dp5"><h1><span>Discussion on Nibbāna</span></h1><p id="XVI.67" class="vism-para"><strong>§67. </strong><span>[Question 1] Is Nibbāna non-existent because it is unapprehendable, like the hare’s horn? </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[579|521]</span><span>[Answer] That is not so, because it is apprehendable by the [right] means.

Because their absence is an impossibility, since if they are absent their non-presence follows. [Besides, if Nibbāna were absence of present aggregates too,] that would entail the fault of excluding the arising of the Nibbāna element with result of past clinging left, at the path moment, which has present aggregates as its support.</span></p><p><span>[Q. 4] Then will there be no fault if it is non-presence of defilements [that is Nibbāna]?</span></p><p><span>[A.] That is not so. Because it would then follow that the noble path was meaningless.

(The last sentence marked ** appears only in the Udāna Commentary. Readings vary considerably):</span></span><span class="p"><span>“Now, in the ultimate sense the existingness of the Nibbāna-element has been demonstrated by the Fully Enlightened One, compassionate for the whole world, by many sutta passages such as ‘Dhammas without condition,’ ‘Unformed dhammas’ (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhs">Dhs</a><span> 2</span></span><span>), ‘Bhikkhus, there is that base (sphere) where neither earth … ’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Ud">Ud</a><span> 80</span></span><span>), ‘This state is very hard to see, that is to say, the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all substance of becoming’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D">D</a><span> II 36</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 167</span></span><span>), ‘Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the unformed and the way leading to the unformed’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> IV 362</span></span><span>), and so on, and in this sutta, ‘Bhikkhus, there is an unborn …” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:It">It</a><span> 87</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Ud">Ud</a><span> 80</span></span><span>). So even if the wise trust completely in the Dispensation and have no doubts, though they may not yet have had direct perception of it, nevertheless there are persons who come to understand through another’s guidance (reading </span><em>paraneyya-buddhino</em><span>); and the intention here is that this logical reasoning under the heading of deduction (</span><em>niddhāraṇa</em><span>) should be for the purpose of removing their doubts.</span></span><span class="p"><span>“Just as it is owing to full-understanding (reading </span><em>yathā pariññeyyatāya</em><span>) that from the sense desires and from materiality, etc (reading </span><em>rūpādīnaṃ</em><span>), that have something beyond them, there is made known an escape [from them] that is their opposite and whose individual essence is devoid of them, so there must exist an escape that is the opposite of, and whose individual essence is devoid of, all formed dhammas, all of which have the aforesaid individual essence (reading </span><em>evaṃ taṃ-sabhāvānaṃ</em><span>), and it is this escape that is the unformed element.</span></span><span class="p"><span>“Besides, insight knowledge, which has formed dhammas as its object, and also conformity knowledge, abandon the defilements with the abandoning consisting in substitution of opposites, being unable to abandon them with the abandoning consisting in cutting off. Likewise, the kind of knowledge that has conventional truth (</span><em>sammuti-sacca</em><span>) [that is, concepts] as its object, in the first jhāna, etc., abandons the defilements only with the abandoning consisting in suppression, not by cutting them off. So, because the kind of knowledge that has formed dhammas as its object and that which has conventional truth as its object are both incapable of abandoning defilements by cutting them off, there must [consequently] exist an object for the noble-path-knowledge that effects their abandonment by cutting them off, [which object must be] of a kind opposite to both. And it is this that is the unformed element.</span></span><span class="p"><span>“Likewise, the words, ‘Bhikkhus, there is an unborn, an unbecome, an unmade, an unformed’ and so on, which demonstrate the existingness of Nibbāna in the ultimate sense, are not misleading because they are spoken by the Blessed One, like the words, ‘All formations are impermanent, all formations are painful, all </span><em>dhammas </em><span>(states) are not self’ (Dhp 277–79; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> I 286</span></span><span>, etc.).</span></span><span class="p"><span>“Likewise, in certain instances as regards scope, the word ‘Nibbāna’ has the correct ultimate meaning for its scope [precisely] because of the existence of its use as a mere metaphor—like the word ‘lion’ (see </span><a href="#XV.n12">Ch.

Because there is no arising of one state with another state’s conditions, it is called </span><em>not otherness</em><span>.

That is untenable. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(519)</span><span> Why? (1) There is no such sutta; (2) it contradicts suttas; (3) it admits of no profound treatment; and (4) it is ungrammatical.</span></p><p id="XVII.9" class="vism-para"><strong>§9. </strong><span>(1) No sutta describes the dependent origination as simple arising.</span></p><p><span>(2) Anyone who asserts that dependent origination is of that kind involves himself in conflict with the Padesavihāra Sutta. How? The Newly Enlightened One’s abiding (</span><em>vihāra</em><span>) is the bringing of the dependent origination to mind, because, of these words of the Blessed One’s: “Then in the first watch of the night the Blessed One brought to mind the dependent origination in direct and reverse order” [as origination and cessation] (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vin">Vin</a><span> I 1</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Ud">Ud</a><span> 2</span></span><span>). Now, “</span><em>padesavihāra</em><span>” is the abiding (</span><em>vihāra</em><span>) in one part (</span><em>desa</em><span>) of that, according as it is said, “Bhikkhus, I abode in a part of the abiding in which I abode when I was newly enlightened” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> V 12</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> I 107</span></span><span>). And there he abode in the vision of structure of conditions, not in the vision of simple arising, according as it is said, “So I understood feeling with wrong view as its condition, and feeling with right view as its condition, and feeling with wrong thinking as its condition …” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> V 12</span></span><span>), all of which should be quoted in full. So anyone who asserts that dependent origination is simple arising involves himself in conflict with the Padesavihāra Sutta.</span></p><p id="XVII.10" class="vism-para"><strong>§10. </strong><span>There is likewise contradiction of the Kaccāna Sutta. For in the Kaccāna Sutta it is said, “When a man sees correctly with right understanding the origination of the world, Kaccāna, he does not say of the world that it is not” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> II 17</span></span><span>). And there it is the dependent origination in forward order, not simple arising, that, as the origination of the world from its conditions, is set forth in order to eliminate the annihilation view. For the annihilation view is not eliminated by seeing simple arising; but it is eliminated by seeing the chain of conditions as a chain of fruits following on a chain of conditions. So anyone who asserts that the dependent origination is simple arising involves himself in contradiction of the Kaccāna Sutta.</span></p><p id="XVII.11" class="vism-para"><strong>§11. </strong><span>(3) </span><em>It admits of no profound treatment</em><span>: this has been said by the Blessed One, “This dependent origination is profound, Ānanda, and profound it appears” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D">D</a><span> II 55</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> II 92</span></span><span>). And the profundity is fourfold as we shall explain below (</span><a href="#XVII.304">XVII.304f.</a><span>); but there is none of that in simple arising. And this dependent origination is explained [by the teachers] as adorned with the fourfold method (</span><a href="#XVII.309">XVII.309</a><span>); but there is no [need of] any such tetrad of methods in simple arising. So dependent origination is not simple arising, since that admits of no profound treatment.</span></p><p id="XVII.12" class="vism-para"><strong>§12. </strong><span>(4) </span><em>It is ungrammatical</em><span>: </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(520)</span><span> this word </span><em>paṭicca</em><span> (lit. “having depended”; freely “due to,” “dependent”), [being a gerund of the verb </span><em>paṭi + eti</em><span>, to go back to], </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[594|536]</span><span>establishes a meaning [in a formula of establishment by verb] when it is construed as past with the same subject [as that of the principal verb], as in the sentence “Having depended on (</span><em>paṭicca</em><span> = ‘due to’) the eye and visible objects, eye-consciousness arises (</span><em>uppajjati</em><span>)” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> II 72</span></span><span>). But if it is construed here with the word </span><em>uppāda</em><span> (arising), [which is a noun], in a formula of establishment by noun, there is a breach of grammar, because there is no shared subject [as there is in above-quoted sentence], and so it does not establish any meaning al all. So the dependent origination is not simple arising because that is ungrammatical.</span></p><p id="XVII.13" class="vism-para"><strong>§13. </strong><span>Here it might be [argued]: “We shall add the words ‘comes to be’ (</span><em>hoti</em><span>) thus: ‘Having depended, arising comes to be’ (</span><em>paṭicca, samuppādo hoti</em><span>).” That will not do. Why not? Because there is no instance in which it has been added, and because the fallacy of the arising of an arising follows. For in such passages as “</span><em>Paṭiccasamuppādaṃ vo bhikkhave desessāmi. Katamo ca bhikkhave paṭiccasamuppādo … Ayaṃ vuccati bhikkhave paṭiccasamuppādo</em><span> (I shall teach you the dependent origination, bhikkhus. And what is the dependent origination? … This is called the dependent origination, bhikkhus)” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> II 1</span></span><span>), the words “comes to be” (</span><em>hoti</em><span>) are not added in any single instance. And there is no [such expression as] “arising comes to be”: if there were, it would be tantamount to saying that arising itself had an arising too.</span></p><p id="XVII.14" class="vism-para"><strong>§14. </strong><span>And those are wrong who imagine that specific conditionality (</span><em>idappaccayatā</em><span>) is the specific conditions’ [abstract] essence—what is called “abstract essence” being a [particular] mode in ignorance, etc., that acts as cause in the manifestation of formations, etc.—and that the term “dependent origination” is used for an alteration in formations when there is that [particular mode in the way of occurrence of ignorance]. Why are they wrong? Because it is ignorance, etc., themselves that are called causes. For in the following passage it is ignorance, etc., themselves, not their alteration, that are called the causes [of these states]: “Therefore, Ānanda, just this is the cause, this is the source, this is the origin, this is the condition, for ageing-and-death, that is to say, birth … for formations, that is to say, (ignorance)” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D">D</a><span> II 57–63</span></span><span>—the last clause is not in the Dīgha text). Therefore it is the actual states themselves as conditions that should be understood as “dependent origination.” So what was said above (</span><a href="#XVII.4">§4</a><span>) can be understood as rightly said.</span></p><p id="XVII.15" class="vism-para"><strong>§15. </strong><span>If any notion arises in the guise of a literal interpretation of the term “dependent origination” (</span><em>paṭicca-samuppāda</em><span>) to the effect that it is only arising that is stated, it should be got rid of by apprehending the meaning of this expression in the following way. For:</span></p><div class="vism-verse"><div><span>In double form this term relates to a totality of state</span></div><div><span>Produced from a conditionality;</span></div><div><span>Hence the conditions for that sum</span></div><div><span>Through metaphor’s device have come</span></div><div><span>To bear their fruits’ name figuratively</span></div><div><span>In the Blessed One’s exposition.</span></div></div><p id="XVII.16" class="vism-para"><strong>§16. </strong><span>This term “dependent origination,” when applied to the total of states produced from the [total] conditionality, must be taken in two ways. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(521)</span><span> For </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[595|537]</span><span>that [total] ought to be arrived at (</span><em>paṭicco—</em><span>adj.),</span><span id="XVII.n2" class="footnote"><span class="p"><em>Paṭicco </em><span>as a declinable adjective is not in PED. </span><em>Patīyamāna </em><span>(“when it is arrived at”): “When it is gone to by direct confrontation (</span><em>paṭimukhaṃ upeyamāno</em><span>) by means of knowledge’s going; when it is penetrated to (</span><em>abhisamiyamāna</em><span>), is the meaning” (Vism-mhṭ 555). The word </span><em>paṭicca </em><span>(due to, depending on) and the word </span><em>paccaya </em><span>(condition) are both gerunds of </span><em>paṭi + eti </em><span>or </span><em>ayati </em><span>(to go back to).</span></span></span><span> since when it is arrived at (</span><em>paṭiyamāno</em><span>), it leads to [supramundane] welfare and bliss and so the wise [regard] it as worthy to be arrived at (</span><em>paccetuṃ</em><span>); and then, when it arises (</span><em>uppajjamāno</em><span>), it does so “together with” (</span><em>saha</em><span>) and “rightly” (</span><em>sammā</em><span>), not singly or causelessly, thus it is a co-arising (</span><em>samuppādo</em><span>). Consequently: it is to be arrived at (</span><em>paṭicco</em><span>) and it is a co-arising (</span><em>samuppādo</em><span>), thus it is dependent origination (</span><em>paṭicca-samuppāda</em><span>). Again: it arises as a togetherness (</span><em>saha</em><span>), thus it is a co-arising (</span><em>samuppāda</em><span>); but it does so having depended (</span><em>paṭicca—</em><span>ger.) in combination with conditions, not regardless of them. Consequently: it, having depended (</span><em>paṭicca</em><span>), is a co-arising (</span><em>samuppāda</em><span>), thus in this way also it is dependent origination (</span><em>paṭicca-samuppāda</em><span>). And the total of causes is a condition for that [total of states produced from the conditionality], so, because it is a condition for that, this [total of causes] is called, “dependent origination,” using for it the term ordinarily used for its fruit just as in the world molasses, which is a condition for phlegm, is spoken of thus, “Molasses is phlegm,” or just as in the Dispensation the arising of Buddhas, which is a condition for bliss, is spoken of thus, “The arising of Buddhas is bliss” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhp">Dhp</a><span> 194</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XVII.17" class="vism-para"><strong>§17. </strong><span>Or alternatively:</span></p><div class="vism-verse"><div><span>The sum of causes too they call</span></div><div><span>“Facing its counterpart,” so all</span></div><div><span>Is in that sense “dependent,” as they tell;</span></div><div><span>This sum of causes too, as stated,</span></div><div><span>Gives fruits that rise associated,</span></div><div><span>So “co-arising” it is called as well.</span></div></div><p id="XVII.18" class="vism-para"><strong>§18. </strong><span>This total of causes—indicated severally under the heading of each cause, beginning with ignorance—for the manifestation of formations, etc., is called “dependent” (</span><em>paṭicco—</em><span>adj.), taking it as “facing, gone to, its counterpart” (</span><em>paṭimukham ito</em><span>) owing to the mutual interdependence of the factors in the combination, in the sense both that they produce common fruit and that none can be dispensed with. And it is called a “co-arising” (</span><em>samuppādo</em><span>) since it causes the states that occur in unresolved mutual interdependence to arise associatedly. Consequently: it is dependent (</span><em>paṭicco</em><span>) and a co-arising (</span><em>samuppādo</em><span>), thus in this way also it is dependent origination (</span><em>paṭicca-samuppāda</em><span>).</span></p><p id="XVII.19" class="vism-para"><strong>§19. </strong><span>Another method:</span></p><div class="vism-verse"><div><span>This total conditionally, acting interdependently,</span></div><div><span>Arouses states together equally;</span></div><div><span>So this too is a reason here wherefore the Greatest Sage, the Seer,</span></div><div><span>Gave to this term its form thus succinctly.</span></div></div><p id="XVII.20" class="vism-para"><strong>§20. </strong><span class="vism-page-bps">[596|538]</span><span>Among the conditions described under the headings of ignorance, etc., the respective conditions that make the [conditionally-arisen] states beginning with formations arise are incapable of making them arise when not mutually dependent and when deficient.

It is like four creeper-gatherers’ ways of seizing a creeper.</span></p><p id="XVII.29" class="vism-para"><strong>§29. </strong><span>(i) For just as one of four men gathering creepers sees only the root of the creeper first, and after cutting it at the root, he pulls it all out and takes it away and uses it, so the Blessed One teaches the dependent origination from the beginning up to the end thus: “So, bhikkhus, with ignorance as condition there are formations; … with birth as condition ageing-and-death” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 261</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XVII.30" class="vism-para"><strong>§30. </strong><span>(ii) Just as another of the four men sees the middle of the creeper first, and after cutting it in the middle, he pulls out only the upper part and takes it away and uses it, so the Blessed One teaches it from the middle up to the end thus: </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[599|541]</span><span>“When he is delighted with, welcomes, remains committed to that feeling, then delight arises in him.

What is their origin? From what are they born? By what are they produced? These four nutriments have craving as their source, craving as their origin, they are born from craving, produced by craving. Craving: what is its source? … Feeling: … Contact: … The sixfold base: … Mentality-materiality: … Consciousness: … Formations: what is their source? … By what are they produced?

Because the dependent origination is wholly beneficial and because he has himself acquired elegance in instructing. For the dependent origination is entirely beneficial: starting from any one of the four starting points, it leads only to the penetration of the proper way. And the Blessed One has acquired elegance in instructing: it is because he has done so through possession of the four kinds of perfect confidence and the four discriminations and by achieving the fourfold profundity (</span><a href="#XVII.304">§304</a><span>) that he teaches the Dhamma by various methods.</span></p><p id="XVII.34" class="vism-para"><strong>§34. </strong><span>But it should be recognized, in particular, that (i) when he sees that people susceptible of teaching are confused about the analysis of the causes of the process [of becoming], he employs his teaching of it forwards starting from the beginning in order to show that the process carries on according to its own peculiar laws and for the purpose of showing the order of arising. (iii) And it should be recognized that when he surveys the world as fallen upon trouble in the way stated thus, “This world has fallen upon trouble; it is born, ages, dies, passes away, and reappears” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> II 10</span></span><span>), he employs his teaching of it backwards starting from the end in order to show the [laws governing the] various kinds of suffering beginning with ageing and death, which he discovered himself in the early stage of his penetration. And (iv) it should be recognized that he employs his teaching of it backwards from the middle down to the beginning in order to show how the succession of cause and fruit extends back into the past [existence], </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[600|542]</span><span>and again forwards from the past, in accordance with his definition of nutriment as the source [of ignorance] (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 47f.</span></span><span>). And (ii) it should be recognized that he employs his teaching of it forwards from the middle up to the end in order to show how the future [existence] follows on [through rebirth] from arousing in the present causes for [rebirth] in the future.</span></p><p id="XVII.35" class="vism-para"><strong>§35. </strong><span>Of these methods of presentation, that cited here should be understood to be that stated in forward order starting from the beginning in order to show to people susceptible of teaching who are confused about the laws of the process [of becoming] that the process carries on according to its own peculiar laws, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(525)</span><span> and for the purpose of showing the order of arising.</span></p><p id="XVII.36" class="vism-para"><strong>§36. </strong><span>But why is ignorance stated as the beginning here? How then, is ignorance the causeless root-cause of the world like the Primordial Essence of those who assert the existence of a Primordial Essence? It is not causeless. For a cause of ignorance is stated thus, “With the arising of cankers there is the arising of ignorance” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 54</span></span><span>). But there is a figurative way in which it can be treated as the root cause. What way is that? When it is made to serve as a starting point in an exposition of the round [of becoming].</span></p><p id="XVII.37" class="vism-para"><strong>§37. </strong><span>For the Blessed One gives the exposition of the round with one of two things as the starting point: either ignorance, according as it is said, “No first beginning of ignorance is made known, bhikkhus, before which there was no ignorance, and after which there came to be ignorance. And while it is said thus, bhikkhus, nevertheless it is made known that ignorance has its specific condition” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> V 113</span></span><span>); or craving for becoming, according as it is said, “No first beginning of craving for becoming is made known, bhikkhus, before which there was no craving for becoming, and after which there came to be craving for becoming. And while it is said thus, bhikkhus, nevertheless it is made known that craving for becoming has its specific condition” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> V 116</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XVII.38" class="vism-para"><strong>§38. </strong><span>But why does the Blessed One give the exposition of the round with those two things as starting points? Because they are the outstanding causes of kamma that leads to happy and unhappy destinies.</span></p><p id="XVII.39" class="vism-para"><strong>§39. </strong><span>Ignorance is an outstanding cause of kamma that leads to unhappy destinies. Why? Because, just as when a cow to be slaughtered is in the grip of the torment of burning with fire and belabouring with cudgels, and being crazed with torment, she drinks the hot water although it gives no satisfaction and does her harm, so the ordinary man who is in the grip of ignorance performs kamma of the various kinds beginning with killing living things that leads to unhappy destinies, although it gives no satisfaction because of the burning of defilements and does him harm because it casts him into an unhappy destiny.</span></p><p id="XVII.40" class="vism-para"><strong>§40. </strong><span>But craving for becoming is an outstanding cause of kamma that leads to happy destinies. Why? Because, just as that same cow, through her craving for cold water, starts drinking cold water, which gives satisfaction and allays her torment, so the ordinary man in the grip of craving for becoming performs kamma of the various kinds beginning with abstention from killing living things that leads to happy destinies and gives satisfaction because it is free from the </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[601|543]</span><span>burning of defilements and, by bringing him to a happy destiny, allays the torment of suffering [experienced] in the unhappy destinies.</span></p><p id="XVII.41" class="vism-para"><strong>§41. </strong><span>Now, as regards these two states that are starting points in expositions of the process [of becoming], in some instances the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma based on a single one of these states, for instance, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(526)</span><span> “Accordingly, bhikkhus, formations have ignorance as their cause, consciousness has formations as its cause” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> II 31</span></span><span>), etc.; likewise, “Bhikkhus, craving increases in one who dwells seeing enjoyment in things productive of clinging; with craving as condition there is clinging” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> II 84</span></span><span>), and so on. In some instances he does so based on both, for instance: “So, bhikkhus, for the fool who is hindered by ignorance and tethered by craving there arises this body. Now, this body [with its six internal bases] and externally [the six bases due to] mentality-materiality make a duality. Due to this duality there is contact, as well as the six [pairs of] bases, touched through which the fool feels pleasure and pain” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> II 23f.</span></span><span>), and so on.</span></p><p id="XVII.42" class="vism-para"><strong>§42. </strong><span>Of these ways of presentation, that cited here in the form “With ignorance as condition there are formations” should be understood as one based on a single state. This, firstly, is how the exposition should be known “as to different ways of teaching.”</span></p><p id="XVII.43" class="vism-para"><strong>§43. </strong><em>2. </em><span>As to meaning: as to the meaning of the words “ignorance” and so on. Bodily misconduct, etc., for example, “ought not to be found” (</span><em>avindiya</em><span>), in the sense of being unfit to be carried out; the meaning is that it should not be permitted. It finds (</span><em>vindati</em><span>) what ought not to be found (</span><em>avindiya</em><span>), thus it is ignorance (</span><em>avijjā</em><span>). Conversely, good bodily conduct, etc. “ought to be found” (</span><em>vindiya</em><span>). It does not find (</span><em>na vindati</em><span>) what ought to be found (</span><em>vindiya</em><span>), thus it is ignorance (</span><em>avijjā</em><span>). Also it prevents knowing (</span><em>avidita</em><span>) the meaning of collection in the aggregates, the meaning of actuating in the bases, the meaning of voidness in the elements, the meaning of predominance in the faculties, the meaning of reality in the truths, thus it is ignorance (</span><em>avijjā</em><span>). Also it prevents knowing the meaning of suffering, etc., described in four ways as “oppression,” etc. (</span><a href="#XVI.15">XVI.15</a><span>), thus it is ignorance. Through all the kinds of generations, destinies, becoming, stations of consciousness, and abodes of beings in the endless round of rebirths it drives beings on (</span><em>AntaVIrahite saṃsāre … satte JAvāpeti</em><span>), thus it is ignorance (</span><em>avijjā</em><span>). Amongst women, men, etc., which are in the ultimate sense non-existent, it hurries on (</span><em>paramatthato AVIJjamānesu itthi-purisādisu JAvati</em><span>), and amongst the aggregates, etc., which are existent, it does not hurry on (</span><em>vijjamānesu pi khandhādisu na javati</em><span>), thus it is ignorance (</span><em>avijjā</em><span>). Furthermore, it is ignorance because it conceals the physical bases and objects of eye-consciousness, etc., and the dependent origination and dependently-originated states.</span></p><p id="XVII.44" class="vism-para"><strong>§44. </strong><span>That due to (</span><em>paṭicca</em><span>) which fruit comes (</span><em>eti</em><span>) is a condition (</span><em>paccaya</em><span>). “Due to” (</span><em>paṭicca</em><span>) = “not without that”; the meaning is, not dispensing with it. “Comes” (</span><em>eti</em><span>) means both “arises” and “occurs.” Furthermore, the meaning of “condition” is the meaning of “help.” It is ignorance and that is a condition, thus it is “ignorance as condition,” whence the phrase “with ignorance as condition.” </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[602|544]</span><span>“They form the formed” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> III 87</span></span><span>), thus they are formations. Furthermore, formations are twofold, namely, (a) formations with ignorance as condition, and (b) formations given in the texts with the word “formations” (</span><em>saṅkhāra</em><span>). Herein, (a) the three, namely, formations of merit, of demerit, and of the imperturbable, and the three, namely, the bodily, the verbal, and the mental formations, which make six, are “formations with ignorance as condition.” And all these are simply mundane profitable and unprofitable volition.</span></p><p id="XVII.45" class="vism-para"><strong>§45. </strong><span>But (b) these four, namely, (i) the formation consisting of the formed (</span><em>saṅkhata-saṅkhāra</em><span>), </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(527)</span><span> (ii) the formation consisting of the kamma-formed (</span><em>abhisaṅkhata-saṅkhāra</em><span>), (iii) the formation consisting in the act of kamma-forming (forming by kamma—</span><em>abhisaṅkharaṇa-saṅkhāra</em><span>), and (iv) the formation consisting in momentum (</span><em>payogābhisaṅkhāra</em><span>), are the kinds of formations that have come in the texts with the word “formations.”</span></p><p id="XVII.46" class="vism-para"><strong>§46. </strong><span>Herein, (i) all states with conditions, given in such passages as “Formations are impermanent” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> I 158</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D">D</a><span> II 157</span></span><span>), are formations consisting of the formed. (ii) In the Commentaries material and immaterial states of the three planes generated by kamma are called formations consisting of the kamma-formed. These are also included in the passage, “Formations are impermanent.” But there is no instance in the texts where they are found separately. (iii) Profitable and unprofitable volition of the three planes is called the formation consisting in the act of kamma-forming. It is found in the texts in such passages as “Bhikkhus, this man in his ignorance forms the formation of merit” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> II 82</span></span><span>). (iv) But it is bodily and mental energy that is called the formation consisting in momentum. This is given in the texts in such passages as “The wheel, having gone as far as the impetus (</span><em>abhisaṅkhāra</em><span>) carried it, stood as though it were fixed” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> I 112</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XVII.47" class="vism-para"><strong>§47. </strong><span>And not only these, but many other kinds of formations are given in the texts with the word “formation” (</span><em>saṅkhāra</em><span>), in the way beginning, “When a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and feeling, friend Visākha, first his verbal formation ceases, then his bodily formation, then his mental formation” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 302</span></span><span>). But there is no formation among them not included by (i) “formations consisting of the formed.”</span></p><p id="XVII.48" class="vism-para"><strong>§48. </strong><span>What is said next after this in the [rest of the exposition] beginning, “With formations as condition, consciousness” should be understood in the way already stated. But as to those words not yet dealt with: It cognizes (</span><em>vijānāti</em><span>), thus it is consciousness (</span><em>viññāṇa—</em><span>see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 292</span></span><span>). It bends [towards an object] (</span><em>namati</em><span>), thus it is mentality (</span><em>nāma</em><span>). It is molested (</span><em>ruppati</em><span>), thus it is materiality (</span><em>rūpa—</em><span>see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> III 87</span></span><span>). It provides a range for the origins (</span><em>āye tanoti</em><span>) and it leads on what is actuated (</span><em>āyatañ ca nayati</em><span>), thus it is a base (</span><em>āyatana—</em><span>see </span><a href="#XV.4">XV.4</a><span>). It touches (</span><em>phusati</em><span>), thus it is contact (</span><em>phassa</em><span>). It is felt (</span><em>vedayati</em><span>), thus it is feeling (</span><em>vedanā—</em><span>see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 293</span></span><span>). It frets (or it thirsts—</span><em>paritassati</em><span>), thus it is craving (</span><em>taṇhā</em><span>). It clings (</span><em>upādiyati</em><span>), thus it is clinging (</span><em>upādāna</em><span>). It becomes (</span><em>bhavati</em><span>) and it makes become (</span><em>bhāvayati</em><span>), thus it is becoming (</span><em>bhava</em><span>). The act of being born is birth. The act of growing old is ageing. By means of it they die, thus it is death. The act of sorrowing is sorrow. The act of lamenting is lamentation. It makes [beings] suffer (</span><em>dukkhayati</em><span>), thus it is pain (</span><em>dukkha</em><span>); or it consumes in two ways (</span><em>DVedhā </em><span class="vism-page-bps">[603|545]</span><em>KHAṇati—</em><span>see </span><a href="#IV.100">IV.100</a><span>) by means of [the two moments (</span><em>khaṇa</em><span>)] arising and presence, thus it is pain (</span><em>dukkha</em><span>). The state of a sad mind (</span><em>dummana-bhāva</em><span>) is grief (</span><em>domanassa</em><span>). Great misery (</span><em>bhuso āyāso</em><span>) is despair (</span><em>upāyāsa</em><span>). </span><em>There is</em><span> means “is generated.”</span></p><p id="XVII.49" class="vism-para"><strong>§49. </strong><span>And the words “There is” should be construed with all the terms, not only with those beginning with sorrow; for otherwise, when “With ignorance as condition, formations” was said, it would not be evident what they did, but by construing it with the words “There is” (or “there are”), since “ignorance as condition” stands for “it is ignorance and that is a condition,” consequently </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(528)</span><span> the defining of the condition and the conditionally-arisen state is effected by the words “with ignorance as condition there are formations.” And so in each instance.</span></p><p id="XVII.50" class="vism-para"><strong>§50. </strong><span>Thus signifies the process described.

Detailed Exposition</span></h1><p id="XVII.58" class="vism-para"><strong>§58. </strong><span>This, firstly, is the brief treatment. The following method, however, is in detail.</span></p><section class="sect-dp5"><h1><span>(1) Ignorance</span></h1><p><span>According to the Suttanta method </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(530)</span><span> ignorance is unknowing about the four instances beginning with suffering. According to the Abhidhamma method it is unknowing about the eight instances [that is to say, the above-mentioned four] together with [the four] beginning with the past; for this is said: “Herein, what is ignorance? It is unknowing about suffering, [unknowing about the origin of suffering, unknowing about the cessation of suffering, unknowing about the way leading to the cessation of suffering], unknowing about the past, unknowing about the future, unknowing about the past and future, unknowing about specific conditionality and conditionally-arisen states” (cf. </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhs">Dhs</a><span> §1162</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XVII.59" class="vism-para"><strong>§59. </strong><span>Herein, while ignorance about any instance that is not the two supra-mundane truths can also arise as object (see </span><a href="#XVII.102">§102</a><span>), nevertheless here it is only intended [subjectively] as concealment. For when [thus] arisen it keeps the truth of </span><em>suffering</em><span> concealed, preventing penetration of the true individual function and characteristic of that truth. Likewise, origin, cessation, and the path, bygone five aggregates called </span><em>the past</em><span>, coming five aggregates called </span><em>the future</em><span>, both of these together called </span><em>the past and future</em><span>, and both specific conditionality and conditionally-arisen states together called </span><em>specific conditionality and conditionally-arisen states—</em><span>all of which it keeps concealed, preventing their true individual </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[606|548]</span><span>functions and characteristics being penetrated thus: “This is ignorance, these are formations.” That is why it is said, “It is unknowing about suffering … unknowing about specific conditionality and conditionally-arisen states.”</span></p></section><section class="sect-dp5"><h1><span>(2) Formations</span></h1><p id="XVII.60" class="vism-para"><strong>§60. </strong><em>Formations</em><span> are the six mentioned in brief above thus, “the three, namely, formations of merit, etc., and the three, namely, the bodily formation, etc.” (</span><a href="#XVII.44">§44</a><span>); but in detail here the [first] three formations are twenty-nine volitions, that is to say, the formation of merit consisting of thirteen volitions, counting the eight sense-sphere profitable volitions that occur in giving, in virtue, etc., and the five fine-material profitable volitions that occur in development [of meditation]; then the formation of demerit consisting of the twelve unprofitable volitions that occur in killing living things, etc.; then the formation of the imperturbable consisting in the four profitable volitions associated with the immaterial sphere, which occur in development [of those meditations].</span></p><p id="XVII.61" class="vism-para"><strong>§61. </strong><span>As regards the other three, the bodily formation is bodily volition, the verbal formation is verbal volition, and the mental formation is mental volition. This triad is mentioned in order to show that at the moment of the accumulation of the kamma the formations of merit, etc., occur in these [three] kamma doors. For the eight sense-sphere profitable and twelve unprofitable volitions, making twenty, are the bodily formation when they occur in the body door and produce bodily intimation. Those same volitions </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(531)</span><span> are called the verbal formation when they occur in the speech door and produce verbal intimation. But volition connected with direct-knowledge is not included here in these two cases because it is not a condition for [resultant rebirth-linking] consciousness later. And like direct-knowledge volition, so also volition connected with agitation is not included; therefore that too should not be included as a condition for [rebirth-linking] consciousness. However, all these have ignorance as their condition. And all the twenty-nine volitions are the mental formation when they arise in the mind door without originating either kind of intimation. So this triad comes within the first triad, and accordingly, as far as the meaning is concerned, ignorance can be understood as condition simply for formations of merit and so on.</span></p><p id="XVII.62" class="vism-para"><strong>§62. </strong><span>Herein, it might be [asked]: How can it be known that these formations have ignorance as their condition?—By the fact that they exist when ignorance exists. For when unknowing—in other words, ignorance—of suffering, etc., is unabandoned in a man, owing firstly to his unknowing about suffering and about the past, etc., then he believes the suffering of the round of rebirths to be pleasant and he embarks upon the three kinds of formations which are the cause of that very suffering. Owing to his unknowing about suffering’s origin he embarks upon formations that, being subordinated to craving, are actually the cause of suffering, imagining them to be the cause of pleasure. And owing to his unknowing about cessation and the path, he misperceives the cessation of suffering to be in some particular destiny [such as the Brahmā-world] that is not in fact cessation; he misperceives the path to cessation, believing it to consist in sacrifices, mortification for immortality, etc., which are not in fact the path to cessation; and so while aspiring to the cessation of suffering, he embarks upon </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[607|549]</span><span>the three kinds of formations in the form of sacrifices, mortification for immortality, and so on.</span></p><p id="XVII.63" class="vism-para"><strong>§63. </strong><span>Furthermore, his non-abandonment of that ignorance about the four truths in particular prevents him from recognizing as suffering the kind of suffering called the fruit of merit, which is fraught with the many dangers beginning with birth, ageing, disease and death, and so he embarks upon the formation of merit classed as bodily, verbal, and mental formations, in order to attain that [kind of suffering], like one desiring celestial nymphs [who jumps over] a cliff. Also, not seeing how that fruit of merit reckoned as pleasure eventually breeds great distress owing to the suffering in its change and that it gives little satisfaction, he embarks upon the formation of merit of the kinds already stated, which is the condition for that very [suffering in change], like a moth that falls into a lamp’s flame, and like the man who wants the drop of honey and licks the honey-smeared knife-edge. Also, not seeing the danger in the indulgence of sense desires, etc., with its results, [wrongly] perceiving pleasure and overcome by defilements, he embarks upon the formation of demerit that occurs in the three doors [of kamma], like a child who plays with filth, and like a man who wants to die and eats poison. Also, unaware of the suffering due to formations and the suffering-in-change [inherent] in kamma-results in the immaterial sphere, owing to the perversion of [wrongly perceiving them as] eternal, etc., he embarks upon the formation of the imperturbable which is a mental formation, like one who has lost his way and takes the road to a goblin city.</span></p><p id="XVII.64" class="vism-para"><strong>§64. </strong><span>So formations exist only when ignorance exists, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(532)</span><span> not when it does not; and that is how it can be known that these formations have ignorance as their condition.</span></p><p><span>This is said too: “Not knowing, bhikkhus, in ignorance, he forms the formation of merit, forms the formation of demerit, forms the formation of the imperturbable. As soon as a bhikkhu’s ignorance is abandoned and clear vision arisen, bhikkhus, with the fading away of ignorance and the arising of clear vision he does not form even formations of merit” (cf. </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> II 82</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XVII.65" class="vism-para"><strong>§65. </strong><span>Here it might be said: “Let us then firstly agree that ignorance is a condition for formations. But it must now be stated for which formations, and in which way it is a condition.”</span></p><p><span>Here is the reply: “Twenty-four conditions have been stated by the Blessed One as follows.”</span></p><section class="sect-dp6"><h1><span>The 24 conditions</span></h1><p id="XVII.66" class="vism-para"><strong>§66. </strong><span>“(1) Root-cause condition, (2) object condition, (3) predominance condition, (4) proximity condition, (5) contiguity condition, (6) conascence condition, (7) mutuality condition, (8) support condition, (9) decisive-support condition, (10) prenascence condition, (11) postnascence condition, (12) repetition condition, (13) kamma condition, (14) kamma-result condition, (15) nutriment condition, (16) faculty condition, (17) jhāna condition, (18) path condition, (19) association condition, (20) dissociation condition, (21) presence condition, (22) absence </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[608|550]</span><span>condition, (23) disappearance condition, (24) non-disappearance condition” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭṭh">Paṭṭh</a><span> I 1</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XVII.67" class="vism-para"><strong>§67. </strong><span>(1) Herein, it is a root-cause and a condition, thus it is </span><em>root-cause condition</em><span>. It is by its being a root-cause that it is a condition; what is meant is that it is a condition owing to its status as root-cause. The same method applies in the case of object condition and the rest.</span></p><p><span>Herein, “cause” (</span><em>hetu</em><span>) is a term for a part of a syllogism, for a reason, and for a root. For with the words “proposition” (</span><em>paṭiññā</em><span>), “cause” (</span><em>hetu</em><span> = middle term), etc., in the world it is a member of a syllogism (</span><em>vacanāvayava</em><span>) that is called a cause. But in the Dispensation, in such passages as “Those states that are produced from a cause” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vin">Vin</a><span> I 40</span></span><span>), it is a reason (</span><em>kāraṇa</em><span>); and in such passages as “Three profitable [root-] causes, three unprofitable [root-]causes” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhs">Dhs</a><span> §1053</span></span><span>), it is a root (</span><em>mūla</em><span>) that is called a cause. The last is intended here.</span></p><p id="XVII.68" class="vism-para"><strong>§68. </strong><span>As to “condition” (</span><em>paccaya</em><span>), the word-meaning here is this: It [the fruit] comes from that, depending thereon (</span><em>paṭicca etasmā eti</em><span>), thus that is a condition; (</span><em>paccaya</em><span>, see note 2) the meaning is, [a state] occurs by not dispensing with that. What is meant is: when a state is indispensable to another state’s presence or arising, the former is a condition for the latter. But as to characteristic, a condition has the characteristic of assisting; for any given state </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(533)</span><span> that assists the presence or arising of a given state is called the latter’s condition. The words condition, cause, reason, source, originator, producer, etc., are one in meaning though different in the letter. So, since it is a cause in the sense of a root, and a condition in the sense of assistance, briefly a state that is assistantial in the sense of a root is a [root-]cause condition.</span></p><p id="XVII.69" class="vism-para"><strong>§69. </strong><span>The intention of [some] teachers is that it establishes the profitable, etc., state in what is profitable, etc., as paddy seeds, etc., do for paddy, etc., and as the colour of gems, etc., do for the lustre of gems, and so on.</span><span id="XVII.n10" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“This refers to the teacher Revata” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 582</span></span><span>).</span></span></span><span> But if that is so, then [it follows that] the state of root-cause condition does not apply to the kinds of materiality originated by it, for it does not establish any profitableness, etc., in them. Nevertheless, it is a condition for them, for this is said: “Root-causes are a condition, as root-cause condition, for the states associated with a root-cause and for the kinds of materiality originated thereby” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭṭh">Paṭṭh</a><span> I 1</span></span><span>). Again, the indeterminateness of root-causeless consciousness is established without it. And the profitableness, etc., of those with root-cause is bound up with wise attention, etc., not with the associated root-causes. And if the profitableness, etc., resided in the associated root-causes as an individual essence, then either the non-greed bound up with the root-cause in the associated states would be only profitable or it would be only indeterminate; but since it can be both, profitableness, etc., in the root-causes must still be sought for, just as in the associated states [such as wise attention, and so on].</span></p><p id="XVII.70" class="vism-para"><strong>§70. </strong><span>But when the root-causes’ sense of root is taken as establishing stableness, rather than as establishing profitableness, etc., there is no contradiction. For states that have obtained a root-cause condition are firm, like trees, and stable; </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[609|551]</span><span>but those without root-cause are, like moss [with roots no bigger than] sesame seeds, etc., unstable. So an assistantial state may be understood as a root-cause condition, since it establishes stableness through being of assistance in the sense of a root.</span></p><p id="XVII.71" class="vism-para"><strong>§71. </strong><span>(2) As to the others that follow, a state that assists by being an object is an </span><em>object condition</em><span>. Now, there are no states that are not object conditions; for the passage beginning “The visible-data base [is a condition, as object condition,] for the eye-consciousness element” concludes thus: “When any states, as states of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants, arise contingent upon any states, these [latter] states are conditions, as object condition, for those [former] states” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭṭh">Paṭṭh</a><span> I 1</span></span><span>).</span><span id="XVII.n11" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“‘</span><em>Which are contingent upon other such states</em><span>’: because it is said without distinction of all visible-data bases … and of all mental-data bases, there is consequently no dhamma (state) among the formed, unformed, and conceptual dhammas, classed as sixfold under visible data, etc., that does not become an object condition” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 584</span></span><span>).</span></span></span><span> For just as a weak man both gets up and stands by hanging on to (</span><em>ālambitvā</em><span>) a stick or rope, so states of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants always arise and are present contingent upon visible data, etc., as their object (</span><em>ārammaṇa = ālambana</em><span>). Therefore all states that are objects of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants should be understood as object condition. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(534)</span></p><p id="XVII.72" class="vism-para"><strong>§72. </strong><span>(3) A state that assists in the sense of being foremost is a </span><em>predominance condition</em><span>. It is of two kinds as conascent and as object. Herein, because of the passage beginning “Predominance of zeal is a condition, as predominance condition, for states associated with zeal and for the kinds of materiality originated thereby” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭṭh">Paṭṭh</a><span> I 2</span></span><span>), it is the four states called zeal, [purity of] consciousness, energy, and inquiry, that should be understood as predominance condition; but not simultaneously, for when consciousness occurs with emphasis on zeal and putting zeal foremost, then it is zeal and not the others that is predominant. So with the rest. But the state, by giving importance to which, immaterial states occur, is their </span><em>object-predominance</em><span>. Hence it is said: “When any states, as states of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants, arise by giving importance to any states, these [latter] states are a condition, as predominance condition, for those [former] states” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭṭh">Paṭṭh</a><span> I 2</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XVII.73" class="vism-para"><strong>§73. </strong><span>(4), (5) A state that assists by being proximate is a </span><em>proximity condition</em><span>. A state that assists by being contiguous is a </span><em>contiguity condition</em><span>. The explanation of this pair of conditions is very diffuse, but substantially it is this:</span><span id="XVII.n12" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“Proximity and contiguity conditions are not stated in accordance with the distinction between making occur and giving opportunity, as the absence and disappearance conditions are: rather they are stated as the causes of the regular order of consciousness [in the cognitive series]” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 585</span></span><span>).</span></span></span><span> the regular order of consciousness begins thus, mind element is proximate (next) after eye-consciousness, mind-consciousness element is proximate (next) after mind element, and this is established only by each preceding consciousness, not otherwise; consequently, a state that is capable of arousing an appropriate kind </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[610|552]</span><span>of consciousness proximate (next) to itself is a proximity condition. Hence it is said: “Proximity condition: eye-consciousness and the states associated therewith are a condition, as proximity condition, for mind element and for the states associated therewith” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭṭh">Paṭṭh</a><span> I 2</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XVII.74" class="vism-para"><strong>§74. </strong><span>(5) Proximity condition is the same as contiguity condition. The difference here is only in the letter, there is none in the meaning; just as in the case of the words “growth” and “continuity” (</span><a href="#XIV.66">XIV.66</a><span>), etc., and as in the case of the “terminology dyad,” “language dyad,” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhs">Dhs</a><span> §1306</span></span><span>) and so on.</span></p><p id="XVII.75" class="vism-para"><strong>§75. </strong><span>The opinion of [certain] teachers</span><span id="XVII.n13" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“This refers to the Elder Revata too” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 586</span></span><span>).</span></span></span><span> is that proximity condition refers to proximity of aim (fruit) and contiguity condition refers to proximity of time. But that is contradicted by such statements as “The profitable [consciousness] belonging to the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception in one who emerges from cessation is a condition, as contiguity condition, for fruition attainment [consciousness]” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭṭh">Paṭṭh</a><span> I 160</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XVII.76" class="vism-para"><strong>§76. </strong><span>Now, they say in this context that “the ability of states to produce [their fruit] is not diminished, but the influence of meditative development prevents states from arising in proximity.” But that only establishes that there is no proximity of time; and we also say the same, namely, that there is no proximity of time there owing to the influence of development. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(535)</span><span> But since there is no proximity of time, the state of contiguity condition is therefore impossible [according to them] since their belief is that the contiguity condition depends on proximity of time (cf. </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> II 363</span></span><span>). Instead of adopting any such misinterpretation, the difference should be treated as residing in the letter only, not in the meaning. How? There is no interval (</span><em>antara</em><span>) between them, thus they are proximate (</span><em>anantara</em><span>); they are quite without interval because [even the distinction of] co-presence is lacking, thus they are contiguous (</span><em>samanantara</em><span>).</span><span id="XVII.n14" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“The state </span><em>of proximity condition </em><span>is the ability to cause arising proximately (without interval) because there is no interval between the cessation of the preceding and the arising of the subsequent.

(iv) What does rebirth-linking [consciousness] have as its object?</span></p><p id="XVII.134" class="vism-para"><strong>§134. </strong><span class="vism-page-bps">[625|567]</span><span>(i) Including the rebirth-linking of non-percipient beings there are twenty kinds of rebirth-linking.</span></p><p><span>(ii) There are nineteen kinds of rebirth-linking consciousnesses, as already described.</span></p><p><span>(iii) Herein, rebirth-linking by means of the unprofitable-resultant root-causeless mind-consciousness element (56) comes about in the states of loss.

IV, n. 24</a><span>), thus it is sense-desire clinging. Also, it is sense-desire and it is clinging, thus it is sense-desire clinging. Clinging (</span><em>upādāna</em><span>) is firm grasping; for here the prefix </span><em>upa</em><span> has the sense of firmness, as in </span><em>upāyāsa</em><span> (great misery—see </span><a href="#XVII.48">§48</a><span>) and </span><em>upakuṭṭha</em><span> (great pox),</span><span id="XVII.n41" class="footnote"><span class="p"><em>Upakuṭṭha—</em><span>“great pox” or “great leprosy”: not in PED; see </span><em>kuṭṭha.</em></span></span><span> and so on. Likewise, it is [false] view and it is clinging, thus it is [false-] view clinging; or, it clings to </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[649|591]</span><span>[false] view, thus it is [false-] view clinging; for in [the case of the false view] “The world and self are eternal” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D">D</a><span> I 14</span></span><span>), etc., it is the latter kind of view that clings to the former. Likewise, it clings to rite and ritual, thus it is rules-and-vows clinging; also, it is rite and ritual and it is clinging, thus it is rules-and-vows clinging; for ox asceticism, ox vows, etc. (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 387f.</span></span><span>), are themselves kinds of clinging, too, because of the misinterpretation (insistence) that purification comes about in this way. Likewise, they indoctrinate by means of that, thus that is doctrine; they cling by means of that, thus that is clinging. What do they indoctrinate with? What do they cling to? Self. The clinging to doctrines of self is self-doctrine clinging. Or by means of that they cling to a self that is a mere doctrine of self; thus that is self-doctrine clinging. This, firstly, is the “analysis of meaning.”</span></p><p id="XVII.242" class="vism-para"><strong>§242. </strong><em>2. </em><span>But as regards </span><em>the brief and full account of states</em><span>, firstly, in brief sense-desire clinging is called “firmness of craving” since it is said: “Herein, what is sense-desire clinging? That which in the case of sense desires is lust for sense desires, greed for sense desires, delight in sense desires, craving for sense desires, fever of sense desires, infatuation with sense desires, committal to sense desires: that is called sense-desire clinging” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhs">Dhs</a><span> §1214</span></span><span>). “Firmness of craving” is a name for the subsequent craving itself, which has become firm by the influence of previous craving, which acts as its decisive-support condition. But some have said: Craving is the aspiring to an object that one has not yet reached, like a thief’s stretching out his hand in the dark; clinging is the grasping of an object that one has reached, like the thief’s grasping his objective. These states oppose fewness of wishes and contentment and so they are the roots of the suffering due to seeking and guarding (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D">D</a><span> II 58f.</span></span><span>). The remaining three kinds of clinging are in brief simply [false] view.</span></p><p id="XVII.243" class="vism-para"><strong>§243. </strong><span>In detail, however, sense-desire clinging is the firm state of the craving described above as of one-hundred-and-eight kinds with respect to visible data and so on. [False-] view clinging is the ten-based wrong view, according as it is said: “Herein what is [false-] view clinging? There is no giving, no offering, … [no good and virtuous ascetics and brahmans who have themselves] realized by direct-knowledge and declare this world and the other world: such view as this … such perverse assumption is called [false-]view clinging” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh">Vibh</a><span> 375</span></span><span>; </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhs">Dhs</a><span> §1215</span></span><span>). Rules-and-vows clinging is the adherence [to the view that] purification comes through rules and vows, according as it is said: “Herein, what is rules-and-vows clinging? … That purification comes through a rite, that purification comes through a ritual, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(570)</span><span> that purification comes through a rite and ritual: such view as this … such perverse assumption is called rules-and-vows clinging” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhs">Dhs</a><span> §1216</span></span><span>). Self-doctrine clinging is the twenty-based [false] view of individuality, according as it is said: “Herein, what is self-doctrine clinging? Here the untaught ordinary man … untrained in good men’s Dhamma, sees materiality as self … such perverse assumption is called self-doctrine clinging” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhs">Dhs</a><span> §1217</span></span><span>). This is the “brief and full account of states.”</span></p><p id="XVII.244" class="vism-para"><strong>§244. </strong><em>3. As to order</em><span>: here order is threefold (see </span><a href="#XIV.211">XIV.211</a><span>), that is to say, order of arising, order of abandoning, and order of teaching. Herein, order of arising of </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[650|592]</span><span>defilements is not meant literally because there is no first arising of defilements in the beginningless round of rebirths. But in a relative sense it is this: usually in a single becoming the misinterpretation of (insistence on) eternity and annihilation are preceded by the assumption of a self. After that, when a man assumes that this self is eternal, rules-and-vows clinging arises in him for the purpose of purifying the self. And when a man assumes that it breaks up, thus disregarding the next world, sense-desire clinging arises in him. So self-doctrine clinging arises first, and after that, [false-] view clinging, and rules-and-vows clinging or sense-desire clinging. This, then, is their order of arising in one becoming.</span></p><p id="XVII.245" class="vism-para"><strong>§245. </strong><span>And here [false-] view clinging, etc., are abandoned first because they are eliminated by the path of stream-entry. Sense-desire clinging is abandoned later because it is eliminated by the path of Arahantship. This is the order of their abandoning.</span></p><p id="XVII.246" class="vism-para"><strong>§246. </strong><span>Sense-desire clinging, however, is taught first among them because of the breadth of its objective field and because of its obviousness. For it has a broad objective field because it is associated with eight kinds of consciousness ((22)–(29)). The others have a narrow objective field because they are associated with four kinds of consciousness ((22), (23), (26) and (27)). And usually it is sense-desire clinging that is obvious because of this generation’s love of attachment (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 167</span></span><span>), not so the other kinds. One possessed of sense-desire clinging is much given to display and ceremony (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 265</span></span><span>) for the purpose of attaining sense desires. [False-] view clinging comes next to the [sense-desire clinging] since that [display and ceremony] is a [false-] view of his.</span><span id="XVII.n42" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>Ee has “</span><em>sassatan ti</em><span>”; Ae has “</span><em>sā’ssa diṭṭhī ti”; </em><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh-a">Vibh-a</a></span><span> (Be), “</span><em>na sassatadiṭṭhī ti</em><span>.”</span></span></span><span> And that is then divided in two as rules-and-vows clinging and self-doctrine clinging. And of these two, rules-and-vows clinging is taught first, being gross, because it can be recognized on seeing [it in the forms of] ox practice and dog practice. And self-doctrine clinging is taught last because of its subtlety. This is the “order of teaching.”</span></p><section class="sect-dp6"><h1><span>How Craving is a Condition for Clinging</span></h1><p id="XVII.247" class="vism-para"><strong>§247. </strong></p><div class="vism-verse"><div><span>For the first in a single way;</span></div><div><span>But for the three remaining kinds</span></div><div><span>In sevenfold or eightfold way.</span></div></div><p id="XVII.248" class="vism-para"><strong>§248. </strong><span>As regards the four kinds of clinging taught in this way, craving for sense desires is a condition in one way, as decisive-support, for the first kind, namely, sense-desire clinging, because it arises in relation to the objective field in which craving delights.

As to meaning</em><span>: Herein, it becomes (</span><em>bhavati</em><span>), thus it is becoming (</span><em>bhava</em><span>). That is twofold as kamma-process becoming and rebirth-process becoming, according as it is said: “Becoming in two ways: there is kamma-process becoming and there is rebirth-process becoming” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh">Vibh</a><span> 137</span></span><span>). Herein, the kamma process itself as becoming is “kamma-process becoming”; likewise the rebirth process itself as becoming is “rebirth-process becoming.” And here, rebirth is becoming since it becomes; but just as “The arising of Buddhas is bliss” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Dhp">Dhp</a><span> 194</span></span><span>) is said because it causes bliss, so too kamma should be understood as “becoming,” using for it the ordinary term for its fruit, since it causes becoming. This, firstly, is how the exposition should be known here “as to meaning.”</span></p><p id="XVII.251" class="vism-para"><strong>§251. </strong><em>2. As to state</em><span>: firstly, kamma-process becoming in brief is both volition and the states of covetousness, etc., associated with the volition and reckoned as kamma too, according as it is said: “Herein, what is kamma-process becoming? The formation of merit, the formation of demerit, the formation of the imperturbable, either with a small (limited) plane or with a large (exalted) plane: that is called kamma-process becoming. Also all kamma that leads to becoming is called kamma-process becoming” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh">Vibh</a><span> 137</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XVII.252" class="vism-para"><strong>§252. </strong><span>Here the formation of merit is, in terms of states, the thirteen kinds of volition ((1)–(13)), the formation of demerit is the twelve kinds ((22)–(33)), and the formation of the imperturbable is the four kinds ((14)–(17)). So with the words </span><em>either with a small (limited) plane or with a large (exalted) plane</em><span> the insignificance or magnitude of these same volitions’ result is expressed here. But with the words </span><em>also all kamma that leads to becoming</em><span> the covetousness, etc., associated with volition are expressed.</span></p><p id="XVII.253" class="vism-para"><strong>§253. </strong><span>Rebirth-process becoming briefly is aggregates generated by kamma. It is of nine kinds, according as it is said: “Herein, what is rebirth-process becoming? Sense-desire becoming, fine-material becoming, immaterial becoming, percipient becoming, non-percipient becoming, neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient becoming, one-constituent becoming, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(572)</span><span> four-constituent becoming, five-constituent becoming: this is called rebirth-process becoming” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh">Vibh</a><span> 17</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XVII.254" class="vism-para"><strong>§254. </strong><span>Herein, the kind of becoming called “having sense desires” is </span><em>sense-desire becoming</em><span>. Similarly with the </span><em>fine-material</em><span> and </span><em>immaterial</em><span> kinds of becoming. It is the becoming of those possessed of perception, or there is perception here in becoming, thus it is </span><em>percipient becoming</em><span>. The opposite kind is </span><em>non-percipient becoming</em><span>. Owing to the absence of gross perception and to the presence of subtle </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[652|594]</span><span>perception there is neither perception nor non-perception in that kind of becoming, thus it is </span><em>neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient becoming</em><span>. It is becoming constituted out of the materiality aggregate only, thus it is </span><em>one-constituent becoming</em><span>, or that kind of becoming has only one constituent, [the materiality aggregate, or dimension,] thus it is one-constituent becoming. And similarly the </span><em>four-constituent </em><span>[has the four mental aggregates, or dimensions,] and the </span><em>five-constituent</em><span> [has the material and the four mental aggregates, or dimensions].</span></p><p id="XVII.255" class="vism-para"><strong>§255. </strong><span>Herein, sense-desire becoming is five aggregates acquired through kamma (clung to). Likewise the fine-material becoming. Immaterial becoming is four. Percipient becoming is four and five. Non-percipient becoming is one aggregate that is acquired through kamma (clung to). Neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient becoming is four. One-constituent becoming, etc., are respectively one, four, and five aggregates as aggregates that are acquired through kamma (clung to).</span></p><p><span>This is how the exposition should be known here “as to state.”</span></p><p id="XVII.256" class="vism-para"><strong>§256. </strong><em>3. As to purpose</em><span>: although formations of merit, etc., are of course dealt with in the same way in the description of becoming and in the description of formations (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh">Vibh</a><span> 135</span></span><span>, 137), nevertheless the repetition has a purpose. For in the former case it was because it was a condition, as past kamma, for rebirth-linking here [in this becoming], while in the latter case it is because it is a condition, as present kamma, for rebirth-linking in the future [becoming]. Or alternatively, in the former instance, in the passage beginning, “Herein, what is the formation of merit? It is profitable volition of the sense sphere” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh">Vibh</a><span> 135</span></span><span>), it was only volitions that were called “formations”; but here, with the words “All kamma that leads to becoming” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh">Vibh</a><span> 137</span></span><span>), the states associated with the volition are also included. And in the former instance it was only such kamma as is a condition for consciousness that was called ‘formations’; but now also that which generates non-percipient becoming is included.</span></p><p id="XVII.257" class="vism-para"><strong>§257. </strong><span>But why so many words? In the clause “With ignorance as condition there are formations,” only profitable and unprofitable states are expressed as the formation of merit, etc.; but in the clause “With clinging as condition, becoming,” profitable and unprofitable and also functional states are expressed because of the inclusion of rebirth-process becoming. So this repetition has a purpose in each case. This is how the exposition should be known “as to purpose here.”</span></p><p id="XVII.258" class="vism-para"><strong>§258. </strong><em>4. As to analysis, synthesis</em><span> means as to both the analysis and the synthesis of becoming that has clinging as its condition. The kamma with sense-desire clinging as its condition that is performed and generates sense-desire becoming is “kamma-process becoming.” The aggregates generated by that are “rebirth-process becoming”; similarly in the case of fine-material and immaterial becoming. So </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(573)</span><span> there are two kinds of sense-desire becoming with sense-desire clinging as condition, included in which are percipient becoming and five-constituent becoming. And there are two kinds of fine-material becoming, included in which are percipient, non-percipient, one-constituent, and five-constituent becoming. And there are two kinds of immaterial becoming, included in which are percipient becoming, neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[653|595]</span><span>becoming, and four-constituent becoming. So, together with what is included by them, there are six kinds of becoming with sense-desire clinging as condition. Similarly too with the [three] remaining kinds of clinging as condition. So, as to analysis, there are, together with what is included by them, twenty-four kinds of becoming with clinging as condition.</span></p><p id="XVII.259" class="vism-para"><strong>§259. </strong><em>5. As to synthesis</em><span>, however, by uniting kamma-process becoming and rebirth-process becoming there is, together with what is included by it, one kind of sense-desire becoming with sense-desire clinging as its condition. Similarly with fine-material and immaterial becoming. So there are three kinds of becoming. And similarly with the remaining [three] kinds of clinging as condition. So by synthesis, there are, together with what is included by them, twelve kinds of becoming with clinging as condition.</span></p><p id="XVII.260" class="vism-para"><strong>§260. </strong><span>Furthermore, without distinction the kamma with clinging as its condition that attains sense-desire becoming is kamma-process becoming. The aggregates generated by that are rebirth-process becoming. Similarly in the fine-material and immaterial becoming. So, together with what is included by them, there are two kinds of sense-desire becoming, two kinds of fine-material becoming, and two kinds of immaterial becoming. So, by synthesis, there are six kinds of becoming by this other method. Or again, without making the division into kamma-process becoming and rebirth-process becoming, there are, together with what is included by them, three kinds of becoming as sense-desire becoming, and so on. Or again, without making the division into sense-desire becoming, etc., there are, together with what is included by them, two kinds of becoming, as kamma-process becoming and rebirth-process becoming. And also without making the division into kamma process and rebirth process there is, according to the words “With clinging as condition, becoming,” only one kind of becoming.</span></p><p><span>This is how the exposition of becoming with clinging as condition should be known here “as to analysis and synthesis.”</span></p><p/><p id="XVII.261" class="vism-para"><strong>§261. </strong><em>6.

For the ordinary man is like a madman, and without considering “Is this right or not?” and aspiring by means of any of the kinds of clinging to any of the kinds of becoming, he performs any of the kinds of kamma. Therefore when some say that the fine-material and immaterial kinds of becoming do not come about through rules-and-vows clinging, that should not be accepted: what should be accepted is that all kinds come about through all kinds.</span></p><p id="XVII.262" class="vism-para"><strong>§262. </strong><span>For example, someone thinks in accordance with hearsay or [false] view that sense desires come to be fulfilled in the human world among the great warrior (</span><em>khattiya</em><span>) families, etc., and in the six divine worlds of the sense sphere. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(574)</span><span> Misled by listening to wrong doctrine, etc., and imagining that “by this kamma sense desires will come to be fulfilled,” he performs for the purpose of attaining them acts of bodily misconduct, etc., through sense-desire clinging.

The aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirth-process becoming.

The kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is kamma-process becoming. The aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirth-process becoming. But percipient, non-percipient, neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient, one-constituent, four-constituent, and five-constituent kinds of becoming are included in that, too.

But when the cutting off of ignorance is effected, he is liberated from them just as the arm caught [in the coils] is liberated when the snake’s head is cut off, according as it is said, “With the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:S">S</a><span> II 1</span></span><span>), and so on. So this is an exposition of the basic state whereby there is bondage for him who grasps it, and liberation for him who lets it go: it is not an exposition of a simple beginning.</span></p><p><span>This is how the Wheel of Becoming should be understood to have no known beginning. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(578)</span></p><p/><p id="XVII.282" class="vism-para"><strong>§282. </strong><em>3.</em><span> This Wheel of Becoming consists in the occurrence of formations, etc., with ignorance, etc., as the respective reasons.

So this Wheel of Becoming should be known “as to the kinds of profundity” in whichever way is appropriate.</span></p><p id="XVII.305" class="vism-para"><strong>§305. </strong><span>(a) Herein, the meaning of ageing-and-death produced and originated with birth as condition is profound owing to difficulty in understanding its origin with birth as condition thus: Neither does ageing-and death not come about from birth, nor, failing birth, does it come about from something else; it arises [only] from birth with precisely that nature [of ageing-and-death]. And the meaning of birth with becoming as condition … and the meaning of formations produced and originated with ignorance as condition are treatable in like manner. That is why this Wheel of Becoming is profound in meaning. This, firstly, is the profundity of meaning here. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(584)</span><span> For it is the fruit of a cause that is called “meaning,” according as it is said, “Knowledge about the fruit of a cause is the discrimination of meaning” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh">Vibh</a><span> 293</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XVII.306" class="vism-para"><strong>§306. </strong><span>(b) The meaning of ignorance as condition for formations is profound since it is difficult to understand in what mode and on what occasion</span><span id="XVII.n46" class="footnote"><span class="p"><em>Avatthā—</em><span>“occasion”: not in PED.</span></span></span><span> ignorance is a condition for the several formations … The meaning of birth as a condition for ageing-and-death is similarly profound.

That is why this Wheel of Becoming is profound in penetration. For here the meaning of ignorance as unknowing and unseeing and non-penetration of the truth is profound; so is the meaning of formations as forming and accumulating with and without greed; so is the meaning of consciousness as void, uninterested, and manifestation of rebirth-linking without transmigration; so is the meaning of mentality-materiality as simultaneous arising, as resolved into components or not, and as bending [on to an object] (</span><em>namana</em><span>) and being molested (</span><em>ruppana</em><span>); so is the meaning of the sixfold base as predominance, world, door, field, and possession of objective field; so is the meaning of contact as touching, impingement, coincidence, and concurrence; so is the meaning of feeling as the experiencing of the stimulus of an object, as pleasure or pain or neutrality, as soulless, and as what is felt; so is the meaning of craving as a delighting in, as a committal to, as a current, as a bindweed, as a river, as the ocean of craving, and as impossible to fill; so is the meaning of clinging as grasping, seizing, misinterpreting, adhering, and hard to get by; so is the meaning of becoming as accumulating, forming, and flinging into the various kinds of generation, destiny, station, and abode; so is the meaning of birth as birth, coming to birth, descent [into the womb], rebirth, and manifestation; and so is the meaning of ageing-and-birth as destruction, fall, break-up and change. This is profundity of </span><em>penetration</em><span>.</span></p><p id="XVII.309" class="vism-para"><strong>§309. </strong><em>6.</em><span> [As to methods:] Then </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(585)</span><span> there are four methods of treating the meaning here. They are (a) the method of identity, (b) the method of diversity, (c) the method of uninterest,</span><span id="XVII.n47" class="footnote"><span class="p"><em>Avyāpāra—</em><span>“uninterest”: here the equivalent of</span><em> anābhoga, </em><span>see </span><a href="#IV.171">IV.171</a><span> and </span><a href="#IX.108">IX.108</a><span>. The perhaps unorthodox form “uninterest” has been used to avoid the “unselfish” sense sometimes implied by “disinterestedness.” </span><em>Vyāpāra </em><span>is clearly intended throughout this work as “motivated action” in contrast with “blind action of natural forces.” The word “interest” has therefore been chosen to bring out this effect.</span></span></span><span> and (d) the method of ineluctable regularity. So this Wheel of Becoming should also be known accordingly “as to the kinds of method.”</span><span id="XVII.n48" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>The dependent origination, or structure of conditions, appears as a flexible formula with the intention of describing the ordinary human situation of a man in his world (or indeed any conscious event where ignorance and craving have not entirely ceased). That situation is always complex, since it is implicit that consciousness with no object, or being (</span><em>bhava—</em><span>becoming, or however rendered) without consciousness (of it), is impossible except as an artificial abstraction. The dependent origination, being designed to portray the essentials of that situation in the limited dimensions of words and using only elements recognizable in experience, is not a logical proposition (Descartes’ </span><em>cogito </em><span>is not a logical proposition). Nor is it a temporal cause-and-effect chain: each member has to be examined as to its nature in order to determine what its relations to the others are (e.g. whether successive in time or conascent, positive or negative, etc., etc.). A purely cause-and-effect chain would not represent the pattern of a situation that is always complex, always subjective-objective, static-dynamic, positive-negative, and so on. Again, there is no evidence of any historical development in the various forms given </span><em>within the limit of the Sutta Piṭaka </em><span>(leaving aside the Paṭisambhidāmagga), and historical treatment within that particular limit is likely to mislead, if it is hypothesis with no foundation.</span></span><span class="p"><span>Parallels with European thought have been avoided in this translation. But perhaps an exception can be made here, with due caution, in the case of Descartes. The revolution in European thought started by his formula </span><em>cogito ergo sum </em><span>(“I think, therefore I am”) is not yet ended. Now, it will perhaps not escape notice that the two elements, “I think” and “I am,” in what is not a logical proposition parallel to some extent the two members of the dependent origination, consciousness and being (becoming). In other words, consciousness activated by craving and clinging as the dynamic factory, guided and blinkered by ignorance (“I think” or “consciousness with the conceit ‘I am’”), conditions being (“therefore I am”) in a complex relationship with other factors relating subject and object (not accounted for by Descartes). The parallel should not be pushed too far. In fact it is only introduced because in Europe the dependent origination seems to be very largely misunderstood with many strange interpretations placed upon it, and because the </span><em>cogito </em><span>does seem to offer some sort of reasonable approach. In this work, for convenience because of the special importance attached here to the aspect of the death-rebirth link, the dependent origination is considered from only one standpoint, namely, as applicable to a period embracing a minimum of three lives. But this is not the only application. With suitable modifications it is also used in the Vibhaṅga to describe the structure of the complex in each one of the 89 single type-consciousnesses laid down in the </span><em>Dhammasaṅgaṇī</em><span>; and Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa says: “This structure of conditions is present not only in (a continuity period consisting of) multiple consciousnesses but also in each single consciousness as well” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vibh-a">Vibh-a</a><span> 199–200</span></span><span>). Also the Paṭisambhidāmagga gives five expositions, four describing dependent origination in one life, the fifth being made to present a special inductive generalization to extend what is observable in this life (the fact that consciousness is always preceded by consciousness, cf. this Ch. §83f.—i.e. that it always has a past and is inconceivable without one) back beyond birth, and (since craving and ignorance ensure its expected continuance) on after death. There are, besides, various other, differing applications indicated by the variant forms given in the suttas themselves.</span></span></span></p><p id="XVII.310" class="vism-para"><strong>§310. </strong><span class="vism-page-bps">[665|607]</span><span>(a) Herein, the non-interruption of the continuity in this way, “With ignorance as condition there are formations; with formations as condition, consciousness,” just like a seed’s reaching the state of a tree through the state of the shoot, etc., is called the “method of identity.” One who sees this rightly abandons the annihilation view by understanding the unbrokenness of the continuity that occurs through the linking of cause and fruit.

One who sees it wrongly clings to the moral-inefficacy-of-action view, because he does not perceive that the causative function of ignorance, etc., is established as a law by their respective individual essences.</span></p><p id="XVII.313" class="vism-para"><strong>§313. </strong><span>(d) The production of only formations, etc., respectively and no others with ignorance, etc., as the respective reasons, like that of curd, etc., with milk, etc., as the respective reasons, is called the “method of ineluctable regularity.” One who sees this rightly abandons the no-cause view and the moral-inefficacy-of-action view by understanding how the fruit accords with its condition. One who sees it wrongly by apprehending it as non-production of anything from anything, instead of apprehending the occurrence of the fruit in accordance with its conditions, clings to the no-cause view and to the doctrine of fatalism.

Contemplation of destruction is the understanding by means of which he resolves the compact into its elements and sees that it is impermanent in the sense of destruction. Its completion starts with contemplation of dissolution, and so there is abandoning of perception of compactness then, but before that there is not, because it has not been completed. (9) The seeing of the dissolution of formations both by actual experience and by inference and the directing of attention to their cessation, in other words, their dissolution, is </span><em>contemplation of fall</em><span>; through it accumulation [of kamma] is abandoned; his consciousness does not incline with craving to the occurrence of that [aggregate-process of existence] for the purpose of which one accumulates [kamma]. (10) Seeing change in the two ways through aging and through death in what is born, or seeing another essence subsequent to the delimitation of such and such [an essence supervening] in what was discerned by means of the material septad, and so on, is ‘</span><em>contemplation of change</em><span>’; by its means he abandons the ‘</span><em>perception of lastingness</em><span>,’ the assumption of stability. (11)–(13) The three beginning with ‘</span><em>contemplation of the signless</em><span>’ are the same as the three beginning with contemplation of impermanence. (11) ‘</span><em>The sign</em><span>’ is the mere appearance of formations as if graspable entities, which is due to the individualization of particular functions and which, owing to perception of unity in continuity and in mass, is assumed to be temporarily enduring or permanent. (12) ‘</span><em>Desire</em><span>’ is longing for pleasure, or it is desire consisting in greed, and so on; it means inclinationto formations owing to craving. (13) ‘</span><em>Misinterpreting</em><span>’ is misinterpreting as self. It is owing to their opposing the ‘</span><em>sign</em><span>,’ etc., that the contemplations of impermanence, etc., are called by the names of ‘signless,’ etc.; so they should be regarded as opposed to the apprehension of a sign, etc., just as they are to the perception of permanence, and so on. (14) Insight that occurs by knowing an object consisting of a visible datum, etc., and by seeing the dissolution of the consciousness that had that visible datum, etc., as its object, and by apprehending voidness through the dissolution thus, ‘Only formations dissolve, there is nothing beyond the death of formations,’ is the higher understanding, and that is insight into states, thus it is ‘</span><em>insight into states that is higher understanding</em><span>’; by its means he abandons the view accompanied by craving that is the misinterpretation occurring as grasping at a permanent core, and so on. (15) ‘</span><em>Correct knowledge and vision</em><span>’ is a term for the seeing of mentality-materiality with its conditions; by its means he abandons the ‘</span><em>misinterpreting due to confusion</em><span>’ that begins thus, ‘Was I in the past?’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 8</span></span><span>) and that begins thus, ‘Thus the world is created by an Overlord’ (?). (16) The knowledge consisting in the seeing of danger in all kinds of becomings, etc., which has arisen owing to the appearance of terror is ‘</span><em>contemplation of danger</em><span>’; by its means he abandons the craving occurring as ‘</span><em>misinterpreting due to reliance</em><span>’ because he does not see any reliance or support. (17) The knowledge of reflection that is the means to deliverance from formations is ‘</span><em>contemplation of reflection</em><span>’; by its means he abandons the ignorance that is ‘</span><em>non-reflection</em><span>’ on impermanence, etc., and is opposed to reflection on them. (18) Equanimity about formations and conformity knowledge are ‘</span><em>contemplation of turning away</em><span>’; for owing to it the mind retreats and recoils from all formations, like a water drop on a lotus leaf, so by its means he abandons the ‘</span><em>misinterpretation due to bondage</em><span>,’ which is the occurrence of the defilements consisting of the fetters of sense desire, and so on.

In this connection Vism-mhṭ quotes the following text: “Friends, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who declares the attainment of Arahantship in my presence has always arrived there by four paths or by one of them. What four? Here, friends, a bhikkhu develops insight preceded by serenity. While he is developing insight preceded by serenity the path is born in him. He cultivates, develops, repeats that path. As he does so his fetters are abandoned and his inherent tendencies are brought to an end. Again, friends, a bhikkhu develops serenity preceded by insight … He develops serenity and insight yoked equally. Again, friends, a bhikkhu’s mind is seized by agitation about highest states. When that consciousness settles down internally, becomes steady, unified and concentrated, then the path is born in him … his inherent tendencies are brought to an end” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:A">A</a><span> II 157</span></span><span>).</span></span></span><span> The distraction due to that is agitation.

He rose up into the air with supernormal power and alighted near the elder, who was sitting in his daytime quarters. He paid homage to him, doing his duty, and sat down at one side. To the question, “Why have you come unexpectedly, friend Dhammadinna?” he replied, “I have come to ask a question, venerable sir.” He was told, “Ask, friend. If we know, we shall say.” He asked a thousand questions.</span></p><p id="XX.112" class="vism-para"><strong>§112. </strong><span>The elder replied without hesitation to each question. To the remark, “Your knowledge is very keen, venerable sir; when was this state attained by you?” he replied, “Sixty years ago, friend.” “Do you practice concentration, venerable sir?”—“That is not difficult, friend.”—“Then make an elephant, venerable sir.” The elder made an elephant all white. “Now, venerable sir, make that elephant come straight at you with his ears outstretched, his tail extended, putting his trunk in his mouth and making a horrible trumpeting.” The elder did so. Seeing the frightful aspect of the rapidly approaching elephant, he sprang up and made to run away. Then the elder with cankers destroyed put out his hand, and catching him by the hem of his robe, he said, “Venerable sir, is there any timidity in one whose cankers are destroyed?”</span></p><p id="XX.113" class="vism-para"><strong>§113. </strong><span class="vism-page-bps">[721|663]</span><span>Then he recognized that he was still an ordinary man. He knelt at Dhammadinna’s feet and said, “Help me, friend Dhammadinna.”—“Venerable sir, I will help you; that is why I came. Do not worry.” Then he expounded a meditation subject to him. The elder took the meditation subject and went up on to the walk, and with the third footstep he reached Arahantship. The elder was a bhikkhu of hating temperament, it seems. Such bhikkhus waver on account of illumination.</span></p><p id="XX.114" class="vism-para"><strong>§114. </strong><em>2. Knowledge </em><span>is knowledge due to insight.

For it is not through the connectedness of states that the characteristic of impermanence becomes apparent to one who rightly observes rise and fall, but rather the characteristic becomes more thoroughly evident through their disconnectedness, as if they were iron darts. ‘</span><em>When the postures are exposed</em><span>’ means when the concealment of the pain that is actually inherent in the postures is exposed.

For when material and immaterial states have arisen mutually steadying each other, [mentality and materiality, for example,] then, owing to misinterpreting that as a unity, compactness of mass is assumed through failure to subject formations to pressure. And likewise compactness of function is assumed when, although definite differences exist in such and such states’ functions, they are taken as one. And likewise compactness of object is assumed when, although differences exist in the ways in which states that take objects make them their objects, those objects are taken as one. But when they are seen after resolving them by means of knowledge into these elements, they disintegrate like froth subjected to compression by the hand. They are mere states (</span><em>dhamma</em><span>) occurring due to conditions and void.

This refers to the way in which insight arrives [at the path] and is expressed literally.</span></p><p id="XXI.73" class="vism-para"><strong>§73. </strong><span>However, in the Paṭisambhidā insight knowledge is expressed as follows: (i) It is expressed firstly as the void liberation by its liberating from misinterpreting [formations]: “Knowledge of contemplation of impermanence is the void liberation since it liberates from interpreting [them] as permanent; knowledge of contemplation of pain is the void liberation since it liberates from interpreting </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[745|687]</span><span>[them] as pleasant; knowledge of contemplation of not-self is the void liberation since it liberates from interpreting [them] as self” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> II 67</span></span><span>). (ii) Then it is expressed as the signless liberation by liberating from signs: “Knowledge of contemplation of impermanence is the signless liberation since it liberates from the sign [of formations] as permanent; knowledge of contemplation of pain is the signless liberation since it liberates from the sign [of formations] as pleasant; knowledge of contemplation of not-self is the signless liberation since it liberates from the sign [of formations] as self” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> II 68</span></span><span>). </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(659)</span><span> (iii) Lastly it is expressed as the desireless liberation by its liberating from desire: “Knowledge of contemplation of impermanence is the desireless liberation since it liberates from desire [for formations] as permanent; knowledge of contemplation of pain is the desireless liberation since it liberates from the desire [for them] as pleasant; knowledge of contemplation of not-self is the desireless liberation since it liberates from the desire [for them] as self” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> II 68</span></span><span>). But although stated in this way, insight knowledge is not literally signless because there is no abandoning of the sign of formations [as formed, here, as distinct from their sign as impermanent and so on]. It is however literally void and desireless. And it is at the moment of the noble path that the liberation is distinguished, and that is done according to insight knowledge’s way of arrival at the path.</span><span id="XXI.n35" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“Why is signless insight unable to give its own name to the path when it has come to the point of arrival at the path? Of course, signless insight is mentioned in the suttas thus, ‘Develop the signless and get rid of the inherent tendency to conceit’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Sn">Sn</a><span> 342</span></span><span>). Nevertheless, though it eliminates the signs of permanence, of lastingness, and of self, it still possesses a sign itself and is occupied with states that possess a sign. Again, the Abhidhamma is the teaching in the ultimate sense, and in the ultimate sense the cause of a signless path is wanting. For the signless liberation is stated in accordance with the contemplation of impermanence, and in that the faith faculty predominates. But the faith faculty is not represented by any one of the factors of the path. And so it cannot give its name to the path since it forms no part of it. In the case of the other two, the desireless liberation is due to the contemplation of pain, and the void liberation is due to the contemplation of not-self. Now the concentration faculty predominates in the desireless liberation and the understanding faculty in the void liberation. So since these are factors of the path as well, they can give their own names to the path; but there is no signless path because the factor is wanting. So some say. But there are others who say that there is a signless path, and that although it does not get its name from the way insight arrives at it, still it gets its name from a special quality of its own and from its object. In their opinion the desireless and void paths should also get their names from special qualities of their own and from their objects too. That is wrong. Why? Because the path gets its names for two reasons, that is, because of its own nature and because of what it opposes—the meaning is, because of its individual essence and because of what it is contrary to. For the desireless path is free from desire due to greed, etc., and the void path is free from greed too, so they both get their names from their individual essence. Similarly, the desireless path is the contrary of desire and the void path is the contrary of misinterpretation as self, so they get their names from what they oppose. On the other hand, the signless path gets its name only from its own nature owing to the non-existence in it of the signs of greed, etc., or of the signs of permanence, etc., but not owing to what it opposes. For it does not oppose the contemplation of impermanence, which has as its object the sign of formations [as formed], but remains in agreement with it. So a signless path is altogether inadmissible by the Abhidhamma method. This is why it is said, ‘This refers to the way in which insight arrives at the path and is expressed in the literal sense’ (§72).</span></span><span class="p"><span>“However, by the Suttanta method a signless path is admissible. For according to that, in whatever way insight leading to emergence (see §83) effects its comprehending it still leads on to emergence of the path, and when it is at the point of arrival it gives its own name to the path accordingly—when emerging owing to comprehension as impermanent the path is signless, when emerging owing to comprehension as painful it is desireless, and when emerging owing to comprehension as not-self it is void. Taking this as a sutta commentary, therefore, three liberations are differentiated here. But in the Paṭisambhidā the deliverance from misinterpreting, from the sign and from desire, are taken respectively as the arrival of the three kinds of comprehension at that deliverance, and what is described is a corresponding state of void liberation, etc., respectively in the paths that follow upon that deliverance. There is no question of treating that literally, which is why he said, ‘However, in the Paṭisambhidā insight knowledge’ and so on” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 846–848</span></span><span>).</span></span></span><span> That, it </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[746|688]</span><span>should be understood, is why only two liberations are stated [in the Abhidhamma], namely, the desireless and the void.</span></p><p><span>This, firstly, is the treatise on the liberations here.</span></p></section><section class="sect-dp5"><h1><span>The Seven Kinds of Noble Persons</span></h1><p id="XXI.74" class="vism-para"><strong>§74. </strong><span>It was said above, “It becomes a condition for the classification of noble persons into seven kinds.” (</span><a href="#XXI.66">§66</a><span>) Herein, there are firstly these seven kinds of noble person: (1) the faith devotee, (2) one liberated by faith, (3) the body witness, (4) the both-ways liberated, (5) the Dhamma devotee, (6) one attained to vision, and (7) one liberated by understanding.

For while some elders say that it is the jhāna used as the basis for insight [leading to emergence] that governs the difference in the [number of] enlightenment factors, path factors, and jhāna factors, and some say that it is the aggregates made the object of insight that govern it, and some say that it is the personal bent that governs it,</span><span id="XXI.n39" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“The first ‘</span><em>some</em><span>’ refers to the Elder Tipiṭaka Cūḷa-Nāga.

In each case there are seven enlightenment factors, eight path factors, and five jhāna factors. For while their preliminary insight can be accompanied by joy and it can be accompanied by equanimity, when their insight reaches the state of equanimity about formations at the time of emergence it is accompanied by joy.</span></p><p id="XXI.113" class="vism-para"><strong>§113. </strong><span>When paths are made to arise by using the second, third, and fourth jhānas in the fivefold reckoning as the basis for insight, then the jhāna in those paths has respectively four, three, and two factors. In each case, however, the path factors number seven, and in the fourth case there are six enlightenment factors. This difference is due both to governance by the basic jhāna and to governance by insight. For again, while their preliminary insight can be accompanied by joy and it can be accompanied by equanimity, their insight leading to emergence is accompanied by joy only.</span></p><p id="XXI.114" class="vism-para"><strong>§114. </strong><span>However, when the path is produced by making the fifth jhāna the basis for insight, then the jhāna factors number two, that is, equanimity and unification </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[754|696]</span><span>of the mind, and there are six enlightenment factors and seven path factors. This difference too is due to both kinds of governance. For in this case the preliminary insight is either accompanied by joy or accompanied by equanimity, but that leading to emergence is accompanied by equanimity only. The same method applies in the case of the path made to arise by making the immaterial jhānas the basis for insight.</span></p><p><span>Also when, after emerging from jhāna made the basis for insight, the path has been produced by comprehending no matter what formations [unrelated to that jhāna], then it is the attainment emerged from at the point nearest to the path that makes it like itself, as the colour of the soil does an monitor lizard’s colour.</span></p><p id="XXI.115" class="vism-para"><strong>§115. </strong><span>But in the case of the second elder’s theory the path is like the attainment, whatever it may be, which was instrumental in producing the path through the comprehension of any of its states after emergence from it. And here governance by insight should be understood in the same way as before.</span></p><p id="XXI.116" class="vism-para"><strong>§116. </strong><span>In the case of the third elder’s theory the path is like that jhāna, whichever it may be, that suits the personal bent, which jhāna was instrumental in producing the path through the comprehension of any of its states in using it as the basis for insight. But this is not accomplished by mere bent alone unless the jhāna has been made the basis for insight or unless the jhāna has been comprehended; and this meaning should be illustrated by the Nandakovāda Sutta (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> III 277</span></span><span>, and Commentary). And here too, governance by insight should be understood in the same way as before.</span></p><p><span>This, firstly, is how it should be understood that equanimity about formations governs the [numbers of] enlightenment factors, path factors, and jhāna factors.</span></p><p id="XXI.117" class="vism-para"><strong>§117. </strong><span>[</span><em>Progress.</em><span>] But if [insight] has from the start only been able to suppress defilements with difficulty, with effort and with prompting, then it is called “of difficult progress.” </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(668)</span><span> The opposite kind is called “of easy progress.” And when the manifestation of the path, the goal of insight, is slowly effected after defilements have been suppressed, then it is called “of sluggish direct-knowledge.” The opposite kind is called “of swift direct-knowledge.” So this equanimity about formations stands at the arrival point and gives its own name to the path in each case, and so the path has four names [according to the kind of progress] (see </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:D">D</a><span> III 228</span></span><span>).</span></p><p id="XXI.118" class="vism-para"><strong>§118. </strong><span>For one bhikkhu this progress is different in the four paths, while for another it is the same. For Buddhas, however, the four paths are of easy progress and swift direct-knowledge. Likewise in the case of the General of the Dhamma [the Elder Sāriputta]. But in the Elder Mahā Moggallāna’s case the first path was of easy progress and swift direct-knowledge, but the others were of difficult progress and sluggish direct-knowledge.</span></p><p id="XXI.119" class="vism-para"><strong>§119. </strong><span>[</span><em>Predominance.</em><span>] And as with the kinds of progress, so also with the kinds of predominance,</span><span id="XXI.n40" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>The four predominances are those of zeal (desire), energy, consciousness, and inquiry.

A noble disciple who seeks the attainment of fruition should go into solitary retreat. He should see formations with insight according to rise and fall and so on.

They should be told: “In that case a non-returner becomes an Arahant and an Arahant, a Paccekabuddha and a Paccekabuddha, a Buddha. For that reason, and because it is contradicted as well by the text quoted above, none of that should be accepted. Only this should be accepted: fruition itself, not path, arises also in the trainer. And if the path he has arrived at had the first jhāna, his fruition will have the first jhāna too when it arises. If the path has the second, so will the fruition. And so with the other jhānas.”</span></p><p><span>This, firstly, is how attaining comes about. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(701)</span></p><p id="XXIII.12" class="vism-para"><strong>§12. </strong><span>(vi) It is made to last in three ways, because of the words: “Friend, there are three conditions for the persistence of the signless mind-deliverance: they are the non-bringing to mind of all signs, the bringing to mind of the signless element, and the </span><em>prior volition</em><span>” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M">M</a><span> I 296–297</span></span><span>).

Herein, of all signs means the sign of materiality, sign of feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. Of course, a man does not bring all those to mind at once, but this is said in order to include all.

This is in brief.</span></p><p id="XXIII.32" class="vism-para"><strong>§32. </strong><span>But the detail is this. When a bhikkhu who desires to attain cessation has finished all that has to do with his meal and has washed his hands and feet well, he sits down on a well-prepared seat in a secluded place. Having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, established mindfulness in front of him, he attains the first jhāna, and on emerging he sees the formations in it with insight as impermanent, painful, not-self.</span></p><p id="XXIII.33" class="vism-para"><strong>§33. </strong><span>This insight is threefold as insight that discerns formations, insight for the attainment of fruition, and insight for the attainment of cessation. Herein, insight that discerns formations, whether sluggish or keen, is the proximate cause only for a path. Insight for the attainment of fruition, which is only valid when keen, is similar to that for the development of a path. Insight for the attainment of cessation is only valid when it is not over-sluggish and not over-keen. Therefore he sees those formations with insight that is not over-sluggish and not over-keen.</span></p><p id="XXIII.34" class="vism-para"><strong>§34. </strong><span>After that, he attains the second jhāna, and on emerging he sees formations with insight in like manner.

Likewise he attains the base consisting </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[797|739]</span><span>of nothingness. On emerging from that he does the fourfold preparatory task, that is to say, about (a) non-damage to others’ property, (b) the Community’s waiting, (c) the Master’s summons, and (d) the limit of the duration. </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(706)</span></p><p id="XXIII.35" class="vism-para"><strong>§35. </strong><span>(a) Herein, </span><em>non-damage to others’ property</em><span> refers to what the bhikkhu has about him that is not his personal property: a robe and bowl, or a bed and chair, or a living room, or any other kind of requisite kept by him but the property of various others. It should be resolved</span><span id="XXIII.n14" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“‘</span><em>It should be resolved</em><span>’: the thought should be aroused. For here the resolve consists in arousing the thought. In the non-arising of consciousness-originated materiality, etc., and in the absence of support by a postnascence condition, etc., the physical body continues the same only for seven days; after that it suffers wastage. So he limits the duration to seven days when he attains cessation, they say” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 903</span></span><span>).</span></span></span><span> that such property will not be damaged, will not be destroyed by fire, water, wind, thieves, rats, and so on. Here is the form of the resolve: “During these seven days let this and this not be burnt by fire; let it not be swept off by water; let it not be spoilt by wind; let it not be stolen by thieves; let it not be devoured by rats, and so on.” When he has resolved in this way, they are not in danger during the seven days.</span></p><p id="XXIII.36" class="vism-para"><strong>§36. </strong><span>If he does not resolve in this way, they may be destroyed by fire, etc., as in the case of the Elder Mahā Nāga. The elder, it seems, went for alms into the village where his mother, a lay follower, lived. She gave him rice gruel and seated him in the sitting hall. The elder sat down and attained cessation. While he was sitting there the hall caught fire. The other bhikkhus each picked up their seats and fled. The villagers gathered together, and seeing the elder, they said, “What a lazy monk! What a lazy monk!” The fire burned the grass thatch, the bamboos, and timbers, and it encircled the elder. People brought water and put it out. They removed the ashes, did repairs,</span><span id="XXIII.n15" class="footnote"><span class="p"><em>Paribhaṇḍa—</em><span>“repair work”: this meaning is not given in PED; cf. </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> IV 157</span></span><span> (patching of old robes), and </span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> I 291</span></span><span>.</span></span></span><span> scattered flowers, and then stood respectfully waiting. The elder emerged at the time he had determined. Seeing them, he said, “I am discovered!,” and he rose up into the air and went to Piyaṅgu Island. This is “non-damage to others’ property.”</span></p><p id="XXIII.37" class="vism-para"><strong>§37. </strong><span>There is no special resolving to be done for what is his own personal property such as the inner and outer robes or the seat he is sitting on. He protects all that by means of the attainment itself, like those of the venerable Sañjīva. And this is said: “There was success by intervention of concentration in the venerable Sañjīva. There was success by intervention of concentration in the venerable Sāriputta” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Paṭis">Paṭis</a><span> I 212</span></span><span>—see </span><a href="#XII.30">XII.30</a><span>).</span></p><p id="XXIII.38" class="vism-para"><strong>§38. </strong><span>(b) </span><em>The Community’s waiting</em><span> is the Community’s expecting. The meaning is: till this bhikkhu comes there is no carrying out of acts of the Community. And here it is not the actual Community’s waiting that is the preparatory task, but the adverting to the waiting. So it should be adverted to in this way: “While I am sitting for seven days in the attainment of cessation, if the Community wants to enact a resolution, etc., I shall emerge before any bhikkhu comes to summon me.” </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(707)</span><span> One who attains it after doing this emerges at exactly that time.</span></p><p id="XXIII.39" class="vism-para"><strong>§39. </strong><span class="vism-page-bps">[798|740]</span><span>But if he does not do so, then perhaps the Community assembles, and not seeing him, it is asked, “Where is the bhikkhu so and so?” They reply, “He has attained cessation.” The Community dispatches a bhikkhu, telling him, “Go and summon him in the name of the Community.” Then as soon as the bhikkhu stands within his hearing and merely says, “The Community is waiting for you, friend,” he emerges. Such is the importance of the Community’s order. So he should attain in such-wise that, by adverting to it beforehand, he emerges by himself.</span></p><p id="XXIII.40" class="vism-para"><strong>§40. </strong><span>(c) </span><em>The Master’s summons</em><span>: here too it is the adverting to the Master’s summons that is the preparatory task. So that also should be adverted to in this way: “While I am sitting for seven days in the attainment of cessation, if the Master, after examining a case, makes known a course of training, or teaches the Dhamma, the origin of which discourse is some need that has arisen,</span><span id="XXIII.n16" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>The word </span><em>atthuppatti</em><span> (“the origin being a need arisen”) is a technical commentarial term. “There are four kinds of origins (</span><em>uppatti</em><span>) or setting forth of suttas (</span><em>sutta-nikkhepa</em><span>): on account of the speaker’s own inclination (</span><em>attajjhāsaya</em><span>), on account of another’s inclination (</span><em>parajjhāsaya</em><span>), as the result of a question asked (</span><em>pucchāvasika</em><span>), and on account of a need arisen (</span><em>atthuppattika</em><span>)’ (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:M-a">M-a</a><span> I 15</span></span><span>, see also Ch. </span><a href="#III.88">III.88</a><span>).</span></span></span><span> I shall emerge before anyone comes to summon me.” For when he has seated himself after doing so, he emerges at exactly that time.</span></p><p id="XXIII.41" class="vism-para"><strong>§41. </strong><span>But if he does not do so, when the Community assembles, the Master, not seeing him, asks, “Where is the bhikkhu so and so?” They reply, “He has attained cessation.” Then he dispatches a bhikkhu, telling him, “Go and summon him in my name.” As soon as the bhikkhu stands within his hearing and merely says, “The Master calls the venerable one,” he emerges. Such is the importance of the Master’s summons. So he should attain in such wise that, by adverting to it beforehand, he emerges himself.</span></p><p id="XXIII.42" class="vism-para"><strong>§42. </strong><span>(d) </span><em>The limit of duration</em><span> is the limit of life’s duration. For this bhikkhu should be very careful to determine what the limit of his life’s duration is. He should attain only after adverting in this way: “Will my own vital formations go on occurring for seven days or will they not?” For if he attains it without adverting when the vital formations are due to cease within seven days, then since the attainment of cessation cannot ward off his death because there is no dying during cessation,</span><span id="XXIII.n17" class="footnote"><span class="p"><span>“‘</span><em>Vital formations</em><span>’ are the same as 1ife span; though some say that they are the life span, heat and consciousness. These are the object only of his normal consciousness. There is no death during cessation because dying takes place by means of the final life-continuum [consciousness]. He should attain only after adverting thus, ‘Let sudden death not occur.’ For in the case of sudden death he would not be able to declare final knowledge, advise the bhikkhus, and testify to the Dispensation’s power. And there would be no reaching the highest path in the case of a non-returner” (</span><span class="vism-bibref"><a href="#bib:Vism-mhṭ">Vism-mhṭ</a><span> 904</span></span><span>).</span></span></span><span> he consequently emerges from the attainment meanwhile. So he should attain only after adverting to that. For it is said that while it may be permissible to omit adverting to others, this must be adverted to.</span></p><p id="XXIII.43" class="vism-para"><strong>§43. </strong><span>Now, when he has thus attained the base consisting of nothingness and emerged and done this preparatory task, he then attains the base consisting of </span><span class="vism-page-bps">[799|741]</span><span>neither perception nor non-perception. Then after one or two turns of consciousness have passed, he becomes without consciousness, he achieves cessation. But why do consciousnesses not go on occurring in him after the two consciousnesses? Because the effort is directed to cessation. For this bhikkhu’s mounting through the eight attainments, coupling together the states of serenity and insight, </span><span class="vism-page-pts">(708)</span><span> is directed to successive cessation, not to attaining the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception. So it is because the effort is directed to cessation that no more than the two consciousnesses occur.</span></p><p id="XXIII.44" class="vism-para"><strong>§44. </strong><span>But if a bhikkhu emerges from the base consisting of nothingness without having done this preparatory task and then attains the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception, he is unable then to become without consciousness: he returns to the base consisting of nothingness and settles down there.</span></p><p id="XXIII.45" class="vism-para"><strong>§45. </strong><span>And here the simile of the man and the road not previously travelled may be told. A man who had not previously travelled a certain road came to a ravine cut by water, or after crossing a deep morass he came to a rock heated by a fierce sun. Then without arranging his inner and outer garments, he descended into the ravine but came up again for fear of wetting his belongings and remained on the bank, or he walked up on to the rock but on burning his feet he returned to the near side and waited there.</span></p><p id="XXIII.46" class="vism-para"><strong>§46. </strong><span>Herein, just as the man, as soon as he had descended into the ravine, or walked up on to the hot rock, turned back and remained on the near side because he had not seen to the arrangement of his inner and outer garments, so too as soon as the meditator has attained the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception, he turns back and remains in the base consisting of nothingness because the preparatory task has not been done.</span></p><p id="XXIII.47" class="vism-para"><strong>§47. </strong><span>Just as when a man who has travelled that road before comes to that place, he puts his inner garment on securely, and taking the other in his hand, crosses over the ravine, or so acts as to tread only lightly on the hot rock and accordingly gets to the other side, so too, when the bhikkhu does the preparatory task and then attains the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception, then he achieves cessation, which is the other side, by becoming without consciousness.</span></p><p id="XXIII.48" class="vism-para"><strong>§48. </strong><span>(vii) </span><em>How is it made to last</em><span>?
