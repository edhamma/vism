<p><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id53" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> <strong>Q.</strong> Now, if a yogin who dwells in pure virtue aspires to accomplish excellent good merits and wishes to acquire the benefits of the austerities, he should consider thus: “Why should one acquire the benefits of the austerities”?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Because of the varying disposition of the yogin. For paucity of wishes, for contentment with little, for freedom from doubt, for the destruction of craving, for the increase of energy, for the sake of using little and not accepting the offerings made to others, for solitude, for the cutting down of clinging and for the protection of moral virtue. These (the merits of the austerities) are the equipment of concentration. These are (practices of) the ancient lineage of the Ariyas. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id54" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> These are the excellent considerations.</p>

<h2>‘Dirt-rags’<a class="headerlink" href="#dirt-rags" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>How does one undertake to observe (the austerity of) ‘dirt-rags’? One sees the fault of asking householders for robes and the merit of ‘dirt-rags’ (and undertakes thus :) “I refuse the offerings of householders and observe (the austerity of) ‘dirt-rags’”.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of the observance of ‘dirt-rags’? (‘Dirt-rags’) are just as useful as householders’ robes <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id70" id="id18" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>18<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> and are enough. One does not depend on others. There is no fear of losing, and one is not attached. Thieves do not want ‘dirt-rags’. (‘Dirt-rags’) are always sufficient for one’s purpose. <span class="target" id="page-bps1995-29"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps1995-29"><span class="std std-ref">29</span></a>/92</span></p>
<p>In getting (‘dirt-rags’) one is not troubled and (this observance) will be an example to good folk. This observance is proper to those who are doubt-free and virtuous. One lives happily in this life. (This observance) will cause one to be liked by the people, and cause them to practise rightly. These are the benefits of the observance of ‘dirt-rags’ praised by the Buddha. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id71" id="id19" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>19<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How many kinds of ‘dirt-rags’ are there? Who observes? <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id72" id="id20" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>20<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> How does one fail?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> There are two kinds of ‘dirt-rags’. The first: ‘dirt-rags’ which are ownerless, the second: ‘dirt-rags’ which are thrown away by people.</p>
<p>Those which one picks up in a cemetery, from a dirt-heap, in the street, or from the road-side and cuts, dyes, pieces together, sews to completion and uses, are called “ ‘dirt-rags’ which are ownerless”. Remnants of cut-cloth, torn pieces of cattle-bitten, mouse-gnawed or burnt cloth and cloth thrown away, cloth on corpses, and cast-off cloth of ascetics are called “ ‘dirt-rags’ which are thrown away by people”.</p>
<p>What is the observance of ‘dirt-rags’? When a bhikkhu refuses the offerings of householders, it is called the observance of ‘dirt-rags’.</p>
<p>How does one fail? When a bhikkhu accepts the offerings of householders, it is called failing.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous teachings<a class="headerlink" href="#miscellaneous-teachings" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>And again one fulfils eight teachings through these thirteen austerities. In the <em>Abhidhamma</em> these eight are taught: “‘Measured food’ and ‘one-eating’ are involved in ‘no food after time’. ‘Dwelling under a tree’, ‘dwelling in a dewy place’, ‘dwelling among the graves’ are involved in ‘dwelling in a peaceful place’, because, if one gathers funds for building a house, or if one likes to (do remunerative) work, keeps animals or is attached to ‘dwelling in a peaceful place’, one’s mind is not at ease. Thus thinking one dwells in peace ‘under a tree’, ‘among the graves’ or ‘in a dewy place’ ”. Thus the eight are fulfilled.</p>
<p>By these eight austerities three teachings are fulfilled: the first: ‘dwelling in a peaceful place’, the second: ‘dirt-rags’, the third: ‘begged food’. If these three are pure, the austerities are fulfilled. Therefore the Buddha taught the Venerable Elder Nanda thus: “Always you should observe ‘dwelling in a peaceful place’, ‘dirt-rags’ and ‘begged food’. You should not nurse your body and life. You should not see the objects of lust.” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id100" id="id48" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>48<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> There are thirteen austerities taught by the Buddha. These are precepts of the Buddha. These are called austerity-factors. Here the skilful, unskilful and the non-characterizable <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id102" id="id50" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>50<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> should not be taught, because the unskilful man is full of lust. He does not remove lust. He lives in wickedness. He is greedy of worldly advantages. Therefore, unskill is (not) austerity.</p>
<p>How many kinds of teachings are there? There are two teachings of austerities: non-greed and non-delusion. The Buddha has said, “If a bhikkhu who observes (the austerity of) ‘dirt-rags’ is endowed with paucity of wishes, is contented with little, enjoys tranquillity, is doubt-free and relies on freedom, then he is called one who observes (the austerity of) ‘dirt-rags’ ”. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id103" id="id51" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>51<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> The other austerities are all greedless and delusion-free. By means of this greedlessness, a bhikkhu removes ignorance in thirteen places. And again by this greed lessness which the Buddha made possible (a bhikkhu) arouses in his mind aversion, and being free from doubt, reasonably removes the stain of lust and crookedness. By this freedom from delusion, he removes weariness of the flesh and crookedness. These are the two teachings of austerities. These are greedlessness and freedom from delusion. <span class="target" id="page-bps1995-38"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps1995-38"><span class="std std-ref">38</span></a>/101</span></p>
<p>Which of the three persons observe the austerities’? The man of greed and the man of delusion observe the austerities. The man of hate cannot’ observe the austerities. The man of greed and the man of delusion can observe the austerities. The man of greed accomplishes heedfulness through attachment. If he becomes heedless, he overcomes greed. Delusion is non-doubting. By means of the austerities a bhikkhu can fulfil heedfulness. If he is heedful, he can overcome delusion well. That is why the man of greed and the man of delusion observe the austerities.</p>
<p>Heedless men suffer and do evil. A heedless man should not observe (because if he does, he will increase his sufferings), just as a person afflicted with a disease of phlegm worsens on taking hot drinks.</p>
<p>And again there is a tradition. A heedless man should dwell ‘in a peaceful place’ or ‘under a tree’. Why should he dwell ‘in a peaceful place’? Because there are no worldly troubles there.</p>
<p>How many seasons are there for the observance of austerities? Eight months are the period for three austerities, namely, ‘dwelling under a tree’, ‘dwelling in a dewy place’ and ‘dwelling among the graves’. The Buddha has permitted dwelling in roofed places in the rainy season. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id104" id="id52" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>52<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> ‘Who is an observer and teacher of the austerities’?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> There is one who is an observer and teacher of the austerities. There is one who is an observer but not a teacher of austerities. There is one who is not an observer but only a teacher of austerities, and there is one who is neither an observer nor a teacher of austerities.</p>
<p>Who is ‘an observer and teacher of austerities’? The Consummate One who has fulfilled the observance of the austerities.</p>
<p>Who is ‘an observer but not a teacher of austerities’? The Consummate One who has not fulfilled the observance of the austerities.</p>
<p>Who is ‘not an observer but only a teacher of austerities’? The learner or the commoner who has fulfilled the observance of the austerities.</p>
<p>Who is ‘neither an observer nor a teacher of austerities’? The learner or the commoner who has not fulfilled the observance of the austerities.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the salient characteristic, function and manifestation of the austerities?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Paucity of wishes is the salient characteristic. Contentment is the function. Non-doubting is the manifestation.</p>
<p>And again non-attachment is the salient characteristic. Moderation is the function. Non-retrogression is the manifestation.</p>
<p>What are the initial, medial and final stages of the austerities? The undertaking to observe is the initial stage. Practice is the medial stage and rejoicing is the final stage. <span class="target" id="page-bps1995-39"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps1995-39"><span class="std std-ref">39</span></a>/102</span></p>
