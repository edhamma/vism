<h2>2 Ways of Discerning Cause and Condition<a class="headerlink" href="#ways-of-discerning-cause-and-condition" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p id="xix-2"><a class="reference internal" href="#xix-2"><span class="std std-ref">§2</span></a> The bhikkhu who wants to accomplish this sets about seeking the cause and condition for that mentality-materiality; just as when a skilled physician encounters a disease he seeks its origin, or just as when a compassionate man sees a tender little child lying on its back in the road he wonders who its parents are.</p>
<section id="neither-created-by-a-creator-nor-causeless">
<h3>2.1 1. Neither Created by a Creator nor Causeless<a class="headerlink" href="#neither-created-by-a-creator-nor-causeless" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p id="xix-3"><a class="reference internal" href="#xix-3"><span class="std std-ref">§3</span></a> To begin with, he considers thus: “Firstly this mentality-materiality is not causeless, because if that were so, it would follow that [having no causes to differentiate it,] it would be identical everywhere always and for all. It has no Overlord, etc., because of the non-existence of any Overlord, etc. (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-16.html#xvi-85"><span class="std std-ref">XVI.85</span></a>), over and above mentality-materiality. And because, if people then argue that mentality-materiality itself is its Overlord, etc., then it follows that their mentality-materiality, which they call the Overlord, etc., would itself be causeless. Consequently there must be a cause and a condition for it. What are they?”</p>
<p id="xix-4"><a class="reference internal" href="#xix-4"><span class="std std-ref">§4</span></a> Having thus directed his attention to mentality-materiality’s cause and condition, he first discerns the cause and condition for the material body in this way: “When this body is born it is not born inside a blue, red or white lotus or water-lily, etc., or inside a store of jewels or pearls, etc.; on the contrary, like a worm in rotting flesh, in a rotting corpse, in rotting dough, in a drain, in a cesspool, etc., it is born in between the receptacle for undigested food and the receptacle for digested food, behind the belly lining, in front of the backbone, surrounded by the bowel and the entrails, in a place that is stinking, disgusting, repulsive, and extremely cramped, being itself stinking, disgusting, and repulsive. When it is born thus, its causes (root-causes) are the four things, namely, ignorance, craving, clinging, and kamma,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">599</span></code>  since it is they that bring about its birth; and nutriment is its condition, since it is that that consolidates it. So five things constitute its cause and condition. And of these, the three beginning with ignorance are the decisive-support for this body, as the <em>[622/680]</em> mother is for her infant, and kamma begets it, as the father does the child; and nutriment sustains it, as the wet-nurse does the infant.”</p>
</section>
<section id="its-occurance-is-always-due-to-conditions">
<h3>2.2 2. Its Occurance is Always Due to Conditions<a class="headerlink" href="#its-occurance-is-always-due-to-conditions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p id="xix-5"><a class="reference internal" href="#xix-5"><span class="std std-ref">§5</span></a> After discerning the material body’s conditions in this way, he again discerns the mental body in the way beginning: “Due to eye and to visible object eye-consciousness arises” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.html#s" id="id1"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>II 72</em> ;  <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.html#m" id="id2"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 111</em> ). When he has thus seen that the occurrence of mentality-materiality is due to conditions, then he sees that, as now, so in the past too its occurrence was due to conditions, and in the future too its occurrence will be due to conditions.</p>
<p id="xix-6"><a class="reference internal" href="#xix-6"><span class="std std-ref">§6</span></a> When he sees it in this way, all his uncertainty is abandoned, that is to say, the five kinds of uncertainty about the past stated thus: “Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past?” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.html#m" id="id3"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 8</em> ), and also the five kinds of uncertainty about the future stated thus: “Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.html#m" id="id4"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 8</em> ); and also the six kinds of uncertainty about the present stated thus: “Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Whence will this being have come? Whither will it be bound?” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.html#m" id="id5"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 8</em> ).</p>

<section id="general-and-particular-conditions">
<h3>2.3 3. General and Particular Conditions<a class="headerlink" href="#general-and-particular-conditions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p id="xix-7"><a class="reference internal" href="#xix-7"><span class="std std-ref">§7</span></a> Another sees the conditions for mentality as two-fold, according to what is common to all and to what is not common to all, and that for materiality as fourfold, according to kamma, and so on.</p>
<p id="xix-8"><a class="reference internal" href="#xix-8"><span class="std std-ref">§8</span></a> The condition for mentality is twofold, as that which is common to all and that which is not common to all. Herein, the six doors beginning with the eye and the six objects beginning with visible data are a condition-common-to-all for mentality because the occurrence of all kinds [of mentality] classified as profitable, etc., is due to that [condition]. But attention, etc., are not common to all; for wise attention, hearing the Good Dhamma, etc., are a condition only for the profitable,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">600</span></code>  while the opposite kinds are a condition for the unprofitable. Kamma, etc., are a condition for the resultant mentality; and the life-continuum, etc., are a condition for the functional.</p>
<p id="xix-9"><a class="reference internal" href="#xix-9"><span class="std std-ref">§9</span></a> Kamma, consciousness, temperature, and nutriment constitute this fourfold condition for materiality beginning with kamma. Herein it is only when it is past that kamma is a condition for kamma-originated materiality; consciousness is a condition, when it is arising, for consciousness-originated materiality.

<p>Of these, (i) the volition, either profitable or unprofitable, of the first of the seven impulsion consciousnesses in a single cognitive series of impulsions is called kamma to be experienced here and now: it gives its result in this same <em>[625/683]</em> selfhood. But if it cannot do so, it is called (iv) lapsed kamma (<em>ahosi-kamma</em>), according to the triad described thus, “There has been (<em>ahosi</em>) kamma, there has been no kamma-result, there will be no kamma-result” (see  <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.html#patis" id="id10"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>II 78</em> ). (ii) The volition of the seventh impulsion that accomplishes its purpose is called kamma to be experienced on rebirth: it gives its result in the next selfhood.

(iii) The volition of the five impulsions between these two is called <em>kamma to be experienced in some subsequent becoming</em>: it gives its result in the future when it gets the opportunity, and however long the round of rebirths continues it never becomes lapsed kamma.</p>

(xi) And when result has already been produced in the provision of rebirth-linking by other kamma, <em>frustrating</em> kamma frustrates and obstructs the pleasure or pain that arises and does not allow it to last. (xii) Supplanting kamma is itself both profitable and unprofitable;  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">602</span></code>  and it supplants other, weaker kamma, prevents its resulting and usurps that kamma’s opportunity in order to cause its own result.

<p id="xix-25"><a class="reference internal" href="#xix-25"><span class="std std-ref">§25</span></a> The knowledge that has been established by the overcoming of doubt about the three periods of time by discerning the conditions of mentality-materiality according to the various methods should be understood as “purification by overcoming doubt.” Other terms for it are “knowledge of the relations of states” and “correct knowledge” and “right vision.”</p>
<p id="xix-26"><a class="reference internal" href="#xix-26"><span class="std std-ref">§26</span></a> For this is said: “Understanding of discernment of conditions thus, ‘Ignorance is a condition, formations are conditionally arisen, and both these states are conditionally arisen,’ is knowledge of the causal relationship of states” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.html#patis" id="id17"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 50</em> ). And:</p>
<p>“When he brings to mind as impermanent, what states does he correctly know and see? How is there right seeing? How, by inference from that, are all formations clearly seen as impermanent?

<p>“When he brings to mind as impermanent, he correctly knows and sees the sign. Hence ‘right seeing’ is said. Thus, by inference from that, all formations are clearly seen as impermanent.

Hence ‘right seeing’ is said. Thus, by inference from that, all states are clearly seen as not-self. Herein doubt is abandoned. <em>[630/688]</em> “Correct knowledge and right seeing and overcoming of doubt  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">605</span></code> —are these things different in meaning and different in the letter or are they one in meaning and only the letter is different?

<p>“If the fruit were to arise from present kamma, the fruit would have arisen in the same moment in which the kamma was being accumulated; and that is not seen, nor is it desirable. For in the world (i.e. among non-Buddhists) kamma has never been shown to give fruit while it is actually being effected; nor is there any text to that effect—But is it not also the fact that no fruit has ever been shown to come from a vanished cause either? Or even a cock to crow because of that?—Certainly it has not been shown where the connectedness of material things is broken off. But the simile does not apply because there is connectedness of immaterial things here. For when the fruit arises from kamma that is actually past it does so because of kamma having been performed and because of storage. For this is said: ‘Because profitable sense-sphere kamma has been performed, stored up, there comes to be eye-consciousness’ ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.html#dhs" id="id20"><span>[Dhs]</span></a> <em>§431</em> ).</p>
<p>“Since consciousness has efficient power only at the instant of its arising, with the acquisition of a proximity condition, etc., it therefore only gives rise to materiality while it is arising. But since materiality has efficient power at the instant of its presence, with the acquisition of a postnascence condition, etc., it is therefore said that ‘temperature and nutriment are conditions at the instant of their presence for temperature-originated and nutriment-originated materiality.’ Temperature and nutriment give rise to materiality at the instant of their own presence by acquiring outside temperature and nutriment as their condition, is the meaning” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.html#vism-mht" id="id21"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>768</em> ).</p>

<p>“To be experienced here and now” means kamma whose fruit is to be experienced in this present selfhood. “To be experienced on rebirth” means kamma whose fruit is to be experienced [in the becoming] next to the present becoming. “To be experienced in some subsequent existence” means kamma whose fruit is to be experienced in some successive selfhood other than either that here and now or next to that here and now. “Lapsed kamma” is kamma of which it has to be said, “There has been kamma, but there has not been, is not, and will not be kamma-result.” “The volition of the first impulsion, which has efficient power by not being prevented by opposition and by having acquired the distinction of a condition, and which has definitely occurred as a prior kamma-formation of the appropriate kind, giving its fruit in this same selfhood, is called ‘<em>to be experienced here and now.</em>’ For while that first-impulsion volition, being effective in the way stated, is helpful to what is associated with its special qualities in the impulsion continuity, yet because it wields little power over aspects and because it has little result owing to lack of repetition, it is not, like the other two kinds, kamma that looks beyond the occurring continuity and looks to obtain an opportunity; it gives its fruit here only as mere result during the course of becoming, like a mere flower. ‘<em>But if it cannot do so</em>’: kamma’s giving of result comes about only through the due concurrence of conditions consisting of (suitable) essentials of becoming, means, etc., failing which it is unable to give its result in that selfhood. ‘<em>That accomplishes its purpose</em>’: that fulfils its purpose consisting in giving, etc., and in killing, etc. For the seventh impulsion to which this refers is the final impulsion in the series, and when it has acquired distinction in the way already stated and has acquired the service of repetition by the previous impulsions, it gives its result in the next selfhood and is called ‘to be experienced on rebirth‘” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.html#vism-mht" id="id23"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>769</em> ).</p>

<p>“‘Weighty’ kamma is very reprehensible unprofitable kamma and very powerful profitable kamma. ‘Habitual’ kamma is what is habitually, continually done and repeated. ‘Death-threshold’ kamma is what is remembered with great vividness at the time next before death; what is meant is that there is no question about what is done at the time of death. ‘That has been often repeated’: he draws a distinction between this kind of kamma as stated and the ‘habitual’ kind and he likewise excludes kamma to be experienced here and now from it because the bringing on of rebirth-linking is admitted; for the tetrad beginning with the ‘weighty’ is stated as productive of rebirth-linking. “Herein, the weighty ripens first of all and that is why it is so called. When weighty kamma is lacking, what has been much done ripens. When that is lacking, death-threshold kamma ripens. When that too is lacking, then kamma done in previous births, which is called ‘kamma [stored up] by being performed,’ ripens.

<p>“‘Productive’ kamma is what produces resultant continuity by providing rebirth-linking and so on. ‘Consolidating’ kamma prolongs the occurrence of the continuity of pleasure or pain, or the endurance of materiality. ‘Frustrating’ kamma slowly diminishes the endurance of pleasure or pain when they occur. It cuts off the result of other kamma without giving any result of its own. ‘Supplanting’ kamma, however, cuts off weak kamma and makes its own result arise. This is their difference” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.html#vism-mht" id="id28"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>771</em> ).</p>

<p>“Another method is this: when some kamma has been done and there is, either in rebirth-linking or in the course of an existence, the arising of material instances due to the result of kamma performed, that kamma is ‘<em>productive</em>.’ When some kamma has been performed and the desirable or undesirable fruit generated by other kamma has its production facilitated and its endurance aided and lengthened by the suppression of conditions that would interfere with it and by the arousing of conditions that would strengthen it, that kamma is ‘<em>supporting</em>.’ When some kamma has been performed and profitable fruit or unprofitable fruit generated by productive kamma is obstructed by it respectively in the form of sickness or of disquieting of elements, that is ‘<em>frustrating</em>’ kamma. But when some kamma has been done by which the fruit of other kamma is ruined and cut off by being supplanted by what cuts it off although it was fit for longer endurance because of the efficacy of the kamma that was producing it, that kamma is ‘<em>supplanting</em>’” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.html#vism-mht" id="id30"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>772</em> ).</p>

<p>“Because it is a speciality of the Buddha and because it is the province of the knowledge that is not shared by disciples (see  <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.html#patis" id="id32"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 121f.</em> ), it is called ‘not shared by disciples.’ That is why only a part can be known; it cannot all be known because it is not the province of such knowledge” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.html#vism-mht" id="id33"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>772</em> ).</p>
