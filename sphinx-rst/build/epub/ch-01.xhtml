</div>
<div class="line">Develops consciousness and understanding,</div>

<div class="line">He succeeds in disentangling this tangle” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id1"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>I 13</em> ).</div>
</div>
<p>This was said. But why was it said? While the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī, it seems, a certain deity came to him in the night, and in order to do away with his doubts, he asked this question:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“The inner tangle and the outer tangle—</div>
<div class="line">This generation is entangled in a tangle.</div>
<div class="line">And so I ask of Gotama this question:</div>
<div class="line">Who succeeds in disentangling this tangle?” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id2"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>I 13</em> ).</div>
</div>
<p id="i-2"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-2"><span class="std std-ref">§2</span></a> Here is the meaning in brief. <em>Tangle</em> is a term for the network of craving. For that is a tangle in the sense of lacing together, like the tangle called network of branches in bamboo thickets, etc., because it goes on arising again and again up and down <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id127" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>42<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  among the objects [of consciousness] beginning with what is visible. But it is called <em>the inner tangle and the outer tangle</em> because it arises [as craving] for one’s own requisites and another’s, for one’s own person and another’s, and for the internal and external bases [for consciousness]. Since it arises in this way, <em>this generation is entangled in a tangle.</em> As the bamboos, etc., are entangled by the bamboo tangle, etc., so too this generation, in other words, this order of living beings, is all entangled by the tangle of craving—the meaning is that it is intertwined, interlaced by it.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2</span></code>  And because it is entangled like this, <em>so I ask of Gotama this question,</em> that is why I ask this. He addressed the Blessed One by his clan name as <em>Gotama. Who</em> <em>[6/64]</em> <em>succeeds in disentangling this tangle:</em> who may disentangle this tangle that keeps the three kinds of existence entangled in this way?—What he asks is, who is capable of disentangling it?</p>
<p id="i-3"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-3"><span class="std std-ref">§3</span></a> However, when questioned thus, the Blessed One, whose knowledge of all things is unimpeded, deity of deities, excelling Sakka (Ruler of Gods), excelling Brahmā, fearless in the possession of the four kinds of perfect confidence, wielder of the ten powers, all-seer with unobstructed knowledge, uttered this stanza in reply to explain the meaning:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“When a wise man, established well in virtue,</div>
<div class="line">Develops consciousness and understanding,</div>
<div class="line">Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious</div>
<div class="line">He succeeds in disentangling this tangle.”</div>
</div>
<p id="i-4"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-4"><span class="std std-ref">§4</span></a></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">My task is now to set out the true sense,</div>
<div class="line">Divided into virtue and the rest,</div>
<div class="line">Of this same verse composed by the Great Sage.</div>
<div class="line">There are here in the Victor’s Dispensation</div>
<div class="line">Seekers gone forth from home to homelessness,</div>
<div class="line">And who although desiring purity</div>
<div class="line">Have no right knowledge of the sure straight way</div>
<div class="line">Comprising virtue and the other two,</div>
<div class="line">Right hard to find, that leads to purity—</div>
<div class="line">Who, though they strive, here gain no purity.</div>
<div class="line">To them I shall expound the comforting <em>Path</em></div>
<div class="line"><em>Of Purification</em>, pure in expositions,</div>
<div class="line">Relying on the teaching of the dwellers</div>
<div class="line">In the Great Monastery; <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id129" id="id4" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>43<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  let all those</div>
<div class="line">Good men who do desire purity</div>
<div class="line">Listen intently to my exposition.</div>
</div>
<p id="i-5"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-5"><span class="std std-ref">§5</span></a> Herein, <em>purification</em> should be understood as Nibbāna, which being devoid of all stains, is utterly pure. <em>The path of purification</em> is the path to that purification; it is the means of approach that is called the path. The meaning is, I shall expound that path of purification.</p>
<p id="i-6"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-6"><span class="std std-ref">§6</span></a> In some instances this path of purification is taught by insight alone, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id130" id="id5" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>44<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  according as it is said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>[7/65]</em> “Formations are all impermanent:</div>
<div class="line">When he sees thus with understanding</div>
<div class="line">And turns away from what is ill,</div>
<div class="line">That is the path to purity” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#dhp" id="id6"><span>[Dhp]</span></a> <em>277</em> ).  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3</span></code></div>
</div>
<p>And in some instances by jhāna and understanding, according as it is said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“He is near unto Nibbāna</div>
<div class="line">In whom are jhāna and understanding” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#dhp" id="id7"><span>[Dhp]</span></a> <em>372</em> ).</div>
</div>
<p>And in some instances by deeds (kamma), etc., according as it is said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“By deeds, vision and righteousness,</div>
<div class="line">By virtue, the sublimest life—</div>
<div class="line">By these are mortals purified,</div>
<div class="line">And not by lineage and wealth” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id8"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>III 262</em> ).</div>
</div>
<p>And in some instances by virtue, etc., according as it is said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“He who is possessed of constant virtue,</div>
<div class="line">Who has understanding, and is concentrated,</div>
<div class="line">Who is strenuous and diligent as well,</div>
<div class="line">Will cross the flood so difficult to cross” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id9"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>I 53</em> ).</div>
</div>
<p>And in some instances by the foundations of mindfulness, etc., according as it is said: “Bhikkhus, this path is the only way for the purification of beings … for the realization of Nibbāna, that is to say, the four foundations of mindfulness” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#d" id="id10"><span>[D]</span></a> <em>II 290</em> ); and similarly in the case of the right efforts, and so on. But in the answer to this question it is taught by virtue and the other two.</p>
<p id="i-7"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-7"><span class="std std-ref">§7</span></a> Here is a brief commentary [on the stanza]. <em>Established well in virtue</em>: standing on virtue. It is only one actually fulfilling virtue who is here said to “stand on virtue.” So the meaning here is this: being established well in virtue by fulfilling virtue. <em>A man:</em> a living being. <em>Wise:</em> possessing the kind of understanding that is born of kamma by means of a rebirth-linking with triple root-cause. <em>Develops consciousness and understanding</em>: develops both concentration and insight. For it is concentration that is described here under the heading of “consciousness,” and insight under that of “understanding.” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id132" id="id11" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>45<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  <em>Ardent</em> (<em>ātāpin</em>): possessing energy. For it is energy that is called “ardour” (<em>ātāpa</em>) in the sense of burning up and consuming (<em>ātāpana-paritāpana</em>) defilements. He has that, thus he is ardent. <em>Sagacious:</em> it is <em>[8/66]</em> understanding that is called “sagacity”; possessing that, is the meaning. This word shows protective understanding. For understanding is mentioned three times in the reply to the question. Herein, the first is naïve understanding, the second is understanding consisting in insight, while the third is the protective understanding that guides all affairs. He sees fear (<em>bhayaṃ ikkhati</em>) in the round of rebirths, thus he is a <em>bhikkhu. He succeeds in disentangling this tangle</em>:  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4</span></code>  Just as a man standing on the ground and taking up a well-sharpened knife might disentangle a great tangle of bamboos, so too, he—this bhikkhu who possesses the six things, namely, this virtue, and this concentration described under the heading of consciousness, and this threefold understanding, and this ardour—standing on the ground of virtue and taking up with the hand of protective-understanding exerted by the power of energy the knife of insight-understanding well-sharpened on the stone of concentration, might disentangle, cut away and demolish all the tangle of craving that had overgrown his own life’s continuity. But it is at the moment of the path that he is said to be disentangling that tangle; at the moment of fruition he has disentangled the tangle and is worthy of the highest offerings in the world with its deities. That is why the Blessed One said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“When a wise man, established well in virtue,</div>
<div class="line">Develops consciousness and understanding,</div>
<div class="line">Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious</div>
<div class="line">He succeeds in disentangling this tangle.”</div>
</div>
<p id="i-8"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-8"><span class="std std-ref">§8</span></a> Herein there is nothing for him to do about the [naïve] understanding on account of which he is called <em>wise</em>; for that has been established in him simply by the influence of previous kamma. But the words <em>ardent</em> and <em>sagacious</em> mean that by persevering with energy of the kind here described and by acting in full awareness with understanding he should, having become well established in virtue, develop the serenity and insight that are described as <em>concentration</em> and <em>understanding.</em> This is how the Blessed One shows the path of purification under the headings of virtue, concentration, and understanding there.</p>
<p id="i-9"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-9"><span class="std std-ref">§9</span></a> What has been shown so far is the three trainings, the dispensation that is good in three ways, the necessary condition for the threefold clear-vision, etc., the avoidance of the two extremes and the cultivation of the middle way, the means to surmounting the states of loss, etc., the abandoning of defilements in three aspects, prevention of transgression etc., purification from the three kinds of defilements, and the reason for the states of stream-entry and so on. How?</p>
<p id="i-10"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-10"><span class="std std-ref">§10</span></a> Here the training of higher virtue is shown by <em>virtue;</em> the training of higher consciousness, by <em>concentration;</em> and the training of higher understanding, by <em>understanding.</em></p>
<p><em>The dispensation’s goodness in the beginning is shown by virtue.</em> Because of the passage, “And what is the beginning of profitable things? Virtue that is quite purified” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id12"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>V 143</em> ), and because of the passage beginning, “The not doing of any evil” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#dhp" id="id13"><span>[Dhp]</span></a> <em>183</em> ), <em>virtue</em> is the beginning of the dispensation. And that is good because it brings about the special qualities of non-remorse, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id134" id="id14" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>46<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  and so on. Its goodness in the <em>[9/67]</em> middle is shown by <em>concentration</em>.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">5</span></code>  Because of the passage beginning, “Entering upon the profitable” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#dhp" id="id15"><span>[Dhp]</span></a> <em>183</em> ), <em>concentration</em> is the middle of the dispensation. And that is good because it brings about the special qualities of supernormal power, and so on. Its goodness in the end is shown by <em>understanding.</em> Because of the passage, “The purifying of one’s own mind—this is the Buddhas’ dispensation” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#dhp" id="id16"><span>[Dhp]</span></a> <em>183</em> ), and because understanding is its culmination, <em>understanding</em> is the end of the dispensation. And that is good because it brings about equipoise with respect to the desired and the undesired. For this is said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“Just as a solid massive rock</div>
<div class="line">Remains unshaken by the wind,</div>
<div class="line">So too, in face of blame and praise</div>
<div class="line">The wise remain immovable” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#dhp" id="id17"><span>[Dhp]</span></a> <em>81</em> ).</div>
</div>
<p id="i-11"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-11"><span class="std std-ref">§11</span></a> Likewise the necessary condition for the triple clear-vision is shown by <em>virtue.</em> For with the support of perfected virtue one arrives at the three kinds of clear-vision, but nothing besides that. The necessary condition for the six kinds of direct-knowledge is shown by <em>concentration.</em> For with the support of perfected concentration one arrives at the six kinds of direct-knowledge, but nothing besides that. The necessary condition for the categories of discrimination is shown by <em>understanding.</em> For with the support of perfected understanding one arrives at the four kinds of discrimination, but not for any other reason. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id135" id="id18" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>47<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>And the avoidance of the extreme called devotion to indulgence of sense desires is shown by <em>virtue.</em> The avoidance of the extreme called devotion to mortification of self is shown by <em>concentration.</em> The cultivation of the middle way is shown by <em>understanding.</em></p>
<p id="i-12"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-12"><span class="std std-ref">§12</span></a> <em>Likewise the means for surmounting the states of loss is shown by virtue</em>; the means for surmounting the element of sense desires, by <em>concentration;</em> and the means for surmounting all becoming, by <em>understanding.</em></p>
<p><em>And the abandoning of defilements by substitution of opposites is shown by virtue</em>; that by suppression is shown by <em>concentration;</em> and that by cutting off is shown by <em>understanding.</em></p>
<p id="i-13"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-13"><span class="std std-ref">§13</span></a> <em>Likewise prevention of defilements’ transgression is shown by virtue;</em> prevention of obsession (by defilement) is shown by <em>concentration;</em> prevention of inherent tendencies is shown by <em>understanding.</em></p>
<p><em>And purification from the defilement of misconduct is shown by virtue;</em> purification from the defilement of craving, by <em>concentration</em>; and purification from the defilement of (false) views, by <em>understanding.</em></p>
<p id="i-14"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-14"><span class="std std-ref">§14</span></a> <em>[10/68]</em>  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">6</span></code>  Likewise the reason for the states of stream-entry and once-return is shown by <em>virtue;</em> that for the state of non-return, by <em>concentration</em>; that for Arahantship by <em>understanding.</em> For the stream-enterer is called “perfected in the kinds of virtue”; and likewise the once-returner. But the non-returner is called “perfected in con-centration.” And the Arahant is called “perfected in understanding” (see  <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id19"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>I 233</em> ).</p>
<p id="i-15"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-15"><span class="std std-ref">§15</span></a> So thus far these nine and other like triads of special qualities have been shown, that is, the three trainings, the dispensation that is good in three ways, the necessary condition for the threefold clear-vision, the avoidance of the two extremes and the cultivation of the middle way, the means for surmounting the states of loss, etc., the abandoning of defilements in three aspects, prevention of transgression, etc., purification from the three kinds of defilements, and the reason for the states of stream-entry, and so on.</p>

<h2>2 II. Virtue</h2>
<p id="i-16"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-16"><span class="std std-ref">§16</span></a> However, even when this path of purification is shown in this way under the headings of virtue, concentration and understanding, each comprising various special qualities, it is still only shown extremely briefly. And so since that is insufficient to help all, there is, in order to show it in detail, the following set of questions dealing in the first place with virtue:</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>What is virtue?</p></li>
<li><p>In what sense is it virtue?</p></li>
<li><p>What are its characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the benefits of virtue?</p></li>
<li><p>How many kinds of virtue are there?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the defiling of it?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the cleansing of it?</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="i-17"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-17"><span class="std std-ref">§17</span></a> Here are the answers:</p>
</section>
<section id="i-what-is-virtue">
<h2>3 (i) What is virtue?</h2>
<p>It is the states beginning with volition present in one who abstains from killing living things, etc., or in one who fulfils the practice of the duties. For this is said in the Paṭisambhidā: “What is virtue? There is virtue as volition, virtue as consciousness-concomitant, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id139" id="id20" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>48<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  virtue as restraint,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">7</span></code>  virtue as non-transgression” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id21"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 44</em> ).</p>
<p>Herein, <em>virtue as volition</em> is the volition present in one who abstains from killing living things, etc., or in one who fulfils the practice of the duties. <em>Virtue as consciousness-concomitant</em> is the abstinence in one who abstains from killing living things, and so on. Furthermore, <em>virtue as volition</em> is the seven volitions [that accompany the first seven] of the [ten] courses of action (kamma) in one who abandons the killing of living things, and so on. <em>Virtue as consciousness-concomitant</em> is the [three remaining] states consisting of non-covetousness, non-ill will, and right view, stated in the way beginning, “Abandoning covetousness, he dwells with a mind free from covetousness” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#d" id="id22"><span>[D]</span></a> <em>I 71</em> ).</p>
<p id="i-18"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-18"><span class="std std-ref">§18</span></a> <em>[11/69]</em> <em>Virtue as restraint</em> should be understood here as restraint in five ways: restraint by the rules of the community (<em>pātimokkha</em>), restraint by mindfulness, restraint by knowledge, restraint by patience, and restraint by energy. Herein, “restraint by the Pātimokkha” is this: “He is furnished, fully furnished, with this Pātimokkha restraint. (Vibh 246)” “Restraint by mindfulness” is this: “He guards the eye faculty, enters upon restraint of the eye faculty” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#d" id="id23"><span>[D]</span></a> <em>I 70</em> ). “Restraint by knowledge” is this:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“The currents in the world that flow, Ajita,” said the Blessed One,</div>
<div class="line">“Are stemmed by means of mindfulness;</div>
<div class="line">Restraint of currents I proclaim,</div>
<div class="line">By understanding they are dammed” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#sn" id="id24"><span>[Sn]</span></a> <em>1035</em> );</div>
</div>
<p>and use of requisites is here combined with this. But what is called “restraint by patience” is that given in the way beginning, “He is one who bears cold and heat” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id25"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 10</em> ). And what is called “restraint by energy” is that given in the way beginning, “He does not endure a thought of sense desires when it arises” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id26"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 11</em> ); purification of livelihood is here combined with this. So this fivefold restraint, and the abstinence, in clansmen who dread evil, from any chance of transgression met with, should all be understood to be “virtue as restraint.”</p>
<p><em>Virtue as non-transgression</em> is the non-transgression, by body or speech, of precepts of virtue that have been undertaken.</p>
<p>This, in the first place, is the answer to the question, “What is virtue?”  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">8</span></code>  Now,</p>

<section id="ii-in-what-sense-is-it-virtue">
<h2>4 (ii) In what sense is it virtue?</h2>
<p id="i-19"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-19"><span class="std std-ref">§19</span></a> as to the rest— (ii) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">In</span> <span class="pre">what</span> <span class="pre">sense</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">it</span> <span class="pre">virtue?</span></code> It is virtue (<em>sīla</em>) in the sense of composing (<em>sīlana</em>). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id140" id="id27" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>49<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  What is this composing? It is either a coordinating (<em>samādhāna</em>), meaning non-inconsistency of bodily action, etc., due to virtuousness; or it is an upholding (<em>upadhāraṇa</em>), <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id140" id="id28" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>49<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> meaning a state of basis (<em>ādhāra</em>) owing to its serving as foundation for profitable states. For those who understand etymology admit only these two meanings. Others, however, comment on the meaning here in the way beginning, “The meaning of virtue (<em>sīla</em>) is the meaning of head (<em>sira</em>), the meaning of virtue is the meaning of cool (<em>sītala</em>).”</p>
</section>
<section id="iii-what-are-its-characteristic-etc">
<h2>5 (iii) What are its characteristic, etc.?</h2>
<p id="i-20"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-20"><span class="std std-ref">§20</span></a> (iii) Now, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">what</span> <span class="pre">are</span> <span class="pre">its</span> <span class="pre">characteristic,</span> <span class="pre">function,</span> <span class="pre">manifestation,</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">proximate</span> <span class="pre">cause?</span></code> Here:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The characteristic of it is composing</div>
<div class="line">Even when analyzed in various ways,</div>
<div class="line">As visibility is of visible data</div>
<div class="line">Even when analyzed in various ways.</div>
</div>
<p>Just as visibleness is the characteristic of the visible-data base even when analyzed into the various categories of blue, yellow, etc., because even when analyzed into these categories it does not exceed visible-ness, so also this same composing, described above as the coordinating of bodily action, etc., and as the foundation of <em>[12/70]</em> profitable states, is the characteristic of virtue even when analyzed into the various categories of volition, etc., because even when analyzed into these categories it does not exceed the state of coordination and foundation.</p>
<p id="i-21"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-21"><span class="std std-ref">§21</span></a> While such is its characteristic:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Its function has a double sense:</div>
<div class="line"><em>Action</em> to stop misconduct, then</div>
<div class="line"><em>Achievement</em> as the quality</div>
<div class="line">Of blamelessness in virtuous men.</div>
</div>
<p>So what is called virtue should be understood to have the function (nature) of stopping misconduct as its function (nature) in the sense of action, and a blameless function (nature) as its function (nature) in the sense of achievement. For under [these headings of] characteristic, etc., it is action (<em>kicca</em>) or it is achievement (<em>sampatti</em>) that is called “function” (<em>rasa—</em>nature).</p>
<p id="i-22"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-22"><span class="std std-ref">§22</span></a></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Now, virtue, so say those who know,</div>
<div class="line">Itself as purity will show;</div>
<div class="line">And for its proximate cause they tell</div>
<div class="line">The pair, conscience and shame, as well.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">9</span></code></div>
</div>
<p>This virtue is manifested as the kinds of purity stated thus: “Bodily purity, verbal purity, mental purity” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id29"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>I 271</em> ); it is manifested, comes to be apprehended, as a pure state. But conscience and shame are said by those who know to be its proximate cause; its near reason, is the meaning. For when conscience and shame are in existence, virtue arises and persists; and when they are not, it neither arises nor persists.</p>
<p>This is how virtue’s characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause, should be understood.</p>

Also it is said further: “Householder, there are these five benefits for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. What five? Here, householder, one who is virtuous, possessed of virtue, obtains a large fortune as a consequence of diligence; this is the first benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. Again, of one who is virtuous, possessed of virtue, a fair name is spread abroad; this is the second benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. Again, whenever one who is virtuous, possessed of virtue, enters an assembly, whether of khattiyas (warrior-nobles) or brahmans or householders or ascetics, he does so without fear or hesitation; this is the third benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. Again, one who is virtuous, possessed of virtue, dies unconfused; this is the fourth benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. Again, one who is virtuous, possessed of virtue, on the breakup of the body, after death, reappears in a happy destiny, in the heavenly world; this is the fifth benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#d" id="id31"><span>[D]</span></a> <em>II 86</em> ). There are also the many benefits of virtue beginning with being dear and loved and ending with destruction of cankers described in the passage beginning, “If a bhikkhu should wish, ‘May I be dear to my fellows in the life of <em>[13/71]</em> purity and loved by them, held in respect and honoured by them,’ let him perfect the virtues” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id32"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 33</em> ).

<h2>7 (v) How many kinds of virtue are there?</h2>
<p id="i-25"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-25"><span class="std std-ref">§25</span></a> <strong>TODO: enumeration?</strong><em>[14/72]</em> (v) Now, here is the answer to the question, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">How</span> <span class="pre">many</span> <span class="pre">kinds</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">virtue</span> <span class="pre">are</span> <span class="pre">there?</span></code></p>
<p>1. Firstly all this virtue is of one kind by reason of its own characteristic of composing.</p>
<p>2. It is of two kinds as keeping and avoiding.</p>
<p>3. Likewise as that of good behaviour and that of the beginning of the life of purity,</p>
<p>4. As abstinence and non-abstinence,</p>
<p>5. As dependent and independent,</p>
<p>6. As temporary and lifelong,</p>
<p>7. As limited and unlimited,</p>
<p>8. As mundane and supramundane.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">11</span></code></p>
<p>9. It is of three kinds as inferior, medium, and superior.</p>
<p>10. Likewise as giving precedence to self, giving precedence to the world, and giving precedence to the Dhamma,</p>
<p>11. As adhered to, not adhered to, and tranquillized.</p>
<p>12. As purified, unpurified, and dubious.</p>
<p>13. As that of the trainer, that of the non-trainer, and that of the neither-trainer-nor-non-trainer.</p>
<p>14. It is of four kinds as partaking of diminution, of stagnation, of distinction, of penetration.</p>
<p>15. Likewise as that of bhikkhus, of bhikkhunīs, of the not-fully-admitted, of the laity,</p>
<p>16. As natural, customary, necessary, due to previous causes,</p>
<p>17. As virtue of Pātimokkha restraint, of restraint of sense faculties, of purification of livelihood, and that concerning requisites.</p>
<p>18. It is of five kinds as virtue consisting in limited purification, etc.; for this is said in the Paṭisambhidā: “Five kinds of virtue: virtue consisting in limited purification, virtue consisting in unlimited purification, virtue consisting in fulfilled purification, virtue consisting in unadhered-to purification, virtue consisting in tranquillized purification” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id33"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 42</em> ).</p>
<p>19. Likewise as abandoning, refraining, volition, restraint, and non-transgression.</p>
<section id="monad">
<h3>7.1 1. Monad</h3>
<p id="i-26"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-26"><span class="std std-ref">§26</span></a> <em>1.</em> Herein, in the section dealing with that of one kind, the meaning should be understood as already stated.</p>
</section>
<section id="dyads">
<h3>7.2 2.–8. Dyads</h3>
<p><em>2.</em> In the section dealing with that of two kinds: fulfilling a training precept announced by the Blessed One thus: “This should be done” is <em>keeping</em>; not doing what is prohibited by him thus: “This should not be done” is <em>avoiding</em>. Herein, the word-meaning is this: they keep (<em>caranti</em>) within that, they proceed as people who fulfil the virtues, thus it is keeping (<em>cāritta</em>); they preserve, they protect, they avoid, thus it is <em>[15/73]</em> <em>avoiding</em>. Herein, <em>keeping</em> is accomplished by faith and energy; <em>avoiding</em>, by faith and mindfulness. This is how it is of two kinds as keeping and avoiding.</p>
<p id="i-27"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-27"><span class="std std-ref">§27</span></a> <em>3.</em> In the second dyad good behaviour is the best kind of behaviour. Good behaviour itself is <em>that of good behaviour;</em> or what is announced for the sake of good behaviour is <em>that of good behaviour.</em> This is a term for virtue other than that which has livelihood as eighth. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id141" id="id34" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>50<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  It is the initial stage of the life of purity consisting in the path, thus it is <em>that of the beginning of the life of purity.</em> This is a term for the virtue that has livelihood as eighth. It is the initial stage of the path because it has actually to be purified in the prior stage too. Hence it is said: “But his bodily action, his verbal action, and his livelihood have already been purified earlier” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id35"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>III 289</em> ). Or the training precepts called “lesser and minor” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#d" id="id36"><span>[D]</span></a> <em>II 154</em> )  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">12</span></code>  are <em>that of good behaviour;</em> the rest are <em>that of the beginning of the life of purity.</em> Or what is included in the Double Code (the bhikkhus’ and bhikkhunīs’ Pātimokkha) is <em>that of the beginning of the life of purity;</em> and that included in the duties set out in the Khandhakas [of Vinaya] is <em>that of good behaviour.</em> Through its perfection <em>that of the beginning of the life of purity</em> comes to be perfected. Hence it is said also “that this bhikkhu shall fulfil the state consisting in the beginning of the life of purity without having fulfilled the state consisting in good behaviour—that is not possible” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id37"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>III 14–15</em> ). So it is of two kinds as that of good behaviour and that of the beginning of the life of purity.</p>
<p id="i-28"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-28"><span class="std std-ref">§28</span></a> <em>4.</em> In the third dyad virtue as <em>abstinence</em> is simply abstention from killing living things, etc.; the other kinds consisting in volition, etc., are virtue as <em>non-abstinence.</em> So it is of two kinds as abstinence and non-abstinence.</p>
<p id="i-29"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-29"><span class="std std-ref">§29</span></a> <em>5.</em> In the fourth dyad there are two kinds of dependence: dependence through craving and dependence through [false] views. Herein, that produced by one who wishes for a fortunate kind of becoming thus, “Through this virtuous conduct [rite] I shall become a [great] deity or some [minor] deity” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id38"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 102</em> ), is <em>dependent</em> through craving. That produced through such [false] view about purification as “Purification is through virtuous conduct” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vibh" id="id39"><span>[Vibh]</span></a> <em>374</em> ) is <em>dependent</em> through [false] view. But the supramundane, and the mundane that is the prerequisite for the aforesaid supramundane, are <em>independent.</em> So it is of two kinds as dependent and independent.</p>
<p id="i-30"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-30"><span class="std std-ref">§30</span></a> <em>6.</em> In the fifth dyad <em>temporary</em> virtue is that undertaken after deciding on a time limit. <em>Lifelong</em> virtue is that practiced in the same way but undertaking it for as long as life lasts. So it is of two kinds as temporary and lifelong.</p>
<p id="i-31"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-31"><span class="std std-ref">§31</span></a> <em>7.</em> In the sixth dyad the <em>limited</em> is that seen to be limited by gain, fame, relatives, limbs, or life. The opposite is <em>unlimited.</em> And this is said in the Paṭisambhidā: “What is the virtue that has a limit? There is virtue that has gain as its limit, there is virtue that has fame as its limit, there is virtue that has relatives as its limit, there is virtue that has limbs as its limit, there is virtue that has life as its limit. What is virtue that <em>[16/74]</em> has gain as its limit? Here someone with gain as cause, with gain as condition, with gain as reason, transgresses a training precept as undertaken: that virtue has gain as its limit” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id40"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 43</em> ),  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">13</span></code>  and the rest should be elaborated in the same way. Also in the answer dealing with the <em>unlimited</em> it is said: “What is virtue that does not have gain as its limit? Here someone does not, with gain as cause, with gain as condition, with gain as reason, even arouse the thought of transgressing a training precept as undertaken, how then shall he actually transgress it? That virtue does not have gain as its limit” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id41"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 44</em> ), and the rest should be elaborated in the same way. So it is of two kinds as limited and unlimited.</p>
<p id="i-32"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-32"><span class="std std-ref">§32</span></a> <em>8.</em> In the seventh dyad all virtue subject to cankers is <em>mundane;</em> that not subject to cankers is <em>supramundane.</em> Herein, the <em>mundane</em> brings about improvement in future becoming and is a prerequisite for the escape from becoming, according as it is said: “Discipline is for the purpose of restraint, restraint is for the purpose of non-remorse, non-remorse is for the purpose of gladdening, gladdening is for the purpose of happiness, happiness is for the purpose of tranquillity, tranquillity is for the purpose of bliss, bliss is for the purpose of concentration, concentration is for the purpose of correct knowledge and vision, correct knowledge and vision is for the purpose of dispassion, dispassion is for the purpose of fading away [of greed], fading away is for the purpose of deliverance, deliverance is for the purpose of knowledge and vision of deliverance, knowledge and vision of deliverance is for the purpose of complete extinction [of craving, etc.] through not clinging. Talk has that purpose, counsel has that purpose, support has that purpose, giving ear has that purpose, that is to say, the liberation of the mind through not clinging” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vin" id="id42"><span>[Vin]</span></a> <em>V 164</em> ). The <em>supramundane</em> brings about the escape from becoming and is the plane of reviewing knowledge. So it is of two kinds as mundane and supramundane.</p>

<section id="triads">
<h3>7.3 9.–13. Triads</h3>
<p id="i-33"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-33"><span class="std std-ref">§33</span></a> <em>9.</em> In the first of the triads the <em>inferior</em> is produced by inferior zeal, [purity of] consciousness, energy, or inquiry; the <em>medium</em> is produced by medium zeal, etc.; the <em>superior</em>, by superior (zeal, and so on). That undertaken out of desire for fame is <em>inferior;</em> that undertaken out of desire for the fruits of merit is <em>medium</em>; that undertaken for the sake of the noble state thus, “This has to be done” is <em>superior.</em> Or again, that defiled by self-praise and disparagement of others, etc., thus, “I am possessed of virtue, but these other bhikkhus are ill-conducted and evil-natured” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id43"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 193</em> ), is <em>inferior</em>; undefiled mundane virtue is <em>medium</em>; supramundane is <em>superior</em>. Or again, that motivated by craving, the purpose of which is to enjoy continued existence, is <em>inferior</em>; that practiced for the purpose of one’s own deliverance is <em>medium</em>; the virtue of the perfections practiced for the deliverance of all beings is <em>superior.</em> So it is of three kinds as inferior, medium, and superior.</p>
<p id="i-34"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-34"><span class="std std-ref">§34</span></a> <em>10.</em> In the second triad that practiced out of self-regard by one who regards self and desires to abandon what is unbecoming to self  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">14</span></code>  is virtue <em>giving precedence to self.</em> That practiced out of regard for the world and out of desire to ward off the censure of the world is virtue <em>giving precedence to the world.</em> That practiced out of regard for the Dhamma and out of desire to honour the majesty of the Dhamma is virtue <em>giving precedence to the Dhamma</em>. So it is of three kinds as giving precedence to self, and so on.</p>
<p id="i-35"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-35"><span class="std std-ref">§35</span></a> <em>11.</em> In the third triad the virtue that in the dyads was called dependent (no. 5) is <em>adhered-to</em> because it is adhered-to through craving and [false] view. That practiced <em>[17/75]</em> by the magnanimous ordinary man as the prerequisite of the path, and that associated with the path in trainers, are <em>not-adhered-to.</em> That associated with trainers’ and non-trainers’ fruition is <em>tranquillized.</em> So it is of three kinds as adhered-to, and so on.</p>
<p id="i-36"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-36"><span class="std std-ref">§36</span></a> <em>12.</em> In the fourth triad that fulfilled by one who has committed no offence or has made amends after committing one is <em>pure.</em> So long as he has not made amends after committing an offence it is <em>impure</em>. Virtue in one who is dubious about whether a thing constitutes an offence or about what grade of offence has been committed or about whether he has committed an offence is <em>dubious</em>. Herein, the meditator should purify impure virtue. If dubious, he should avoid cases about which he is doubtful and should get his doubts cleared up. In this way his mind will be kept at rest. So it is of three kinds as pure, and so on.</p>
<p id="i-37"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-37"><span class="std std-ref">§37</span></a> <em>13.</em> In the fifth triad the virtue associated with the four paths and with the [first] three fruitions <em>is that of the trainer.</em> That associated with the fruition of Arahantship <em>is that of the non-trainer.</em> The remaining kinds are <em>that of the neither-trainer-nor-non-trainer.</em> So it is of three kinds as that of the trainer, and so on.</p>
<p id="i-38"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-38"><span class="std std-ref">§38</span></a> But in the world the nature of such and such beings is called their “habit” (<em>sīla</em>) of which they say: “This one is of happy habit (<em>sukha-sīla</em>), this one is of unhappy habit, this one is of quarrelsome habit, this one is of dandified habit.” Because of that it is said in the Paṭisambhidā figuratively: “Three kinds of virtue (habit): profitable virtue, unprofitable virtue, indeterminate virtue” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id44"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 44</em> ). So it is also called of three kinds as profitable, and so on. Of these, the unprofitable is not included here since it has nothing whatever to do with the headings beginning with the characteristic, which define virtue in the sense intended in this [chapter]. So the threefoldness should be understood only in the way already stated.</p>

<section id="tetrads">
<h3>7.4 14.–17. Tetrads</h3>
<p id="i-39"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-39"><span class="std std-ref">§39</span></a> <em>14.</em> In the first of the tetrads:</p>
<div class="line-block">

<div class="line">With wrong thoughts often in his mind</div>
<div class="line">His faculties he will not guard—</div>
<div class="line">Virtue in such a constitution</div>

<div class="line">But has dispassion for his goal—</div>
<div class="line">His virtue through such aspiration</div>

<p>So it is of four kinds as partaking of diminution, and so on.</p>
<p id="i-40"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-40"><span class="std std-ref">§40</span></a> <em>15.</em> In the second tetrad there are training precepts announced for bhikkhus to keep irrespective of what is announced for bhikkhunīs. This is the virtue <em>of bhikkhus</em>. There are training precepts announced for bhikkhunīs to keep irrespective of what is announced for bhikkhus. This is the virtue of <em>bhikkhunīs.</em> The ten precepts of virtue for male and female novices are the virtue <em>of the not fully admitted</em>. The five training precepts—ten when possible—as a permanent undertaking and eight as the factors of the Uposatha Day, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id142" id="id45" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>51<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  for male and female lay followers are the virtue <em>of the laity</em>.

<p id="i-41"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-41"><span class="std std-ref">§41</span></a> <em>16.</em> In the third tetrad the non-transgression on the part of Uttarakuru human beings is <em>natural virtue</em>. Each clan’s or locality’s or sect’s own rules of conduct are <em>customary virtue</em>. The virtue of the Bodhisatta’s mother described thus: “It is the necessary rule, Ānanda, that when the Bodhisatta has descended into his mother’s womb, no thought of men that is connected with the cords of sense desire comes to her” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#d" id="id46"><span>[D]</span></a> <em>II 13</em> ), is <em>necessary virtue</em>. But the virtue of such pure beings as Mahā Kassapa, etc., and of the Bodhisatta in his various births is virtue <em>due to previous causes</em>. So it is of four kinds as natural virtue, and so on.</p>
<section id="virtue-of-the-fourfold-purification">
<h4>7.4.1 Virtue of the fourfold purification</h4>
<p id="i-42"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-42"><span class="std std-ref">§42</span></a> <em>17.</em> In the fourth tetrad:</p>
<p>(a) The virtue described by the Blessed One thus: “Here a bhikkhu dwells restrained with the Pātimokkha restraint, possessed of the [proper] conduct and resort, and seeing fear in the slightest fault, he trains himself by undertaking the precepts of training, ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vibh" id="id47"><span>[Vibh]</span></a> <em>244</em> )” is <em>virtue of Pātimokkha restraint</em>.</p>
<p>(b) That described thus: “On seeing a visible object with the eye,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">16</span></code>  he apprehends neither the signs nor the particulars through which, if he left the eye faculty unguarded, evil and unprofitable states of covetousness and grief might invade him; he enters upon the way of its restraint, he guards the eye faculty, undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear … On smelling an odour with the nose … On tasting a flavour with the tongue … On <em>[19/77]</em> touching a tangible object with the body … On cognizing a mental object with the mind, he apprehends neither the signs nor the particulars through which, if he left the mind faculty unguarded, evil and unprofitable states of covetousness and grief might invade him; he enters upon the way of its restraint, he guards the mind faculty, undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id48"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 180</em> ), is <em>virtue of restraint of the sense faculties</em>.</p>
<p>(c) Abstinence from such wrong livelihood as entails transgression of the six training precepts announced with respect to livelihood and entails the evil states beginning with “Scheming, talking, hinting, belittling, pursuing gain with gain” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id49"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>II 75</em> ) is <em>virtue of livelihood purification</em>.</p>
<p>(d) Use of the four requisites that is purified by the reflection stated in the way beginning, “Reflecting wisely, he uses the robe only for protection from cold” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id50"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 10</em> ) is called <em>virtue concerning requisites</em>.</p>

<p><em>Restrained with the Pātimokkha restraint</em>: here “Pātimokkha” (Rule of the Community) <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id143" id="id51" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>52<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  is the virtue of the training precepts; for it frees (<em>mokkheti</em>) him who protects (<em>pāti</em>) it, guards it, it sets him free (<em>mocayati</em>) from the pains of the states of loss, etc., that is why it is called <em>Pātimokkha</em>. “Restraint” is restraining; this is a term for bodily and verbal non-transgression. The Pātimokkha itself as restraint is “Pātimokkha restraint.” “Restrained with the Pātimokkha restraint” is restrained by means of the restraint consisting in that Pātimokkha; he has it, possesses it, is the meaning. <em>Dwells</em>: bears himself in one of the postures.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">17</span></code></p>
<p id="i-44"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-44"><span class="std std-ref">§44</span></a> The meaning of <em>possessed of [the proper] conduct and resort</em>, etc., should be understood in the way in which it is given in the text. For this is said: “Possessed of [the proper] conduct and resort: there is [proper] conduct and improper conduct. Herein, what is improper conduct? Bodily transgression, verbal transgression, bodily and verbal transgression—this is called improper conduct. Also all unvirtuousness is improper conduct. Here someone makes a livelihood by gifts of bamboos, or by gifts of leaves, or by gifts of flowers, fruits, bathing powder, and tooth sticks, or by flattery, or by bean-soupery, or by fondling, or by going on errands on foot, or by one or other of the sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by the Buddhas—this is called improper conduct. Herein, what is [proper] conduct? Bodily <em>[20/78]</em> non-transgression, verbal non-transgression, bodily and verbal non-transgression—this is called [proper] conduct. Also all restraint through virtue is [proper] conduct. Here someone “does not make a livelihood by gifts of bamboos, or by gifts of leaves, or by gifts of flowers, fruits, bathing powder, and tooth sticks, or by flattery, or by bean-soupery, or by fondling, or by going on errands on foot, or by one or other of the sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by the Buddhas—this is called [proper] conduct.”</p>
<p id="i-45"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-45"><span class="std std-ref">§45</span></a> “[Proper] resort: there is [proper] resort and improper resort. Herein, what is improper resort? Here someone has prostitutes as resort, or he has widows, old maids, eunuchs, bhikkhunīs, or taverns as resort; or he dwells associated with kings, kings’ ministers, sectarians, sectarians’ disciples, in unbecoming association with laymen; or he cultivates, frequents, honours, such families as are faithless, untrusting, abusive and rude, who wish harm, wish ill, wish woe, wish no surcease of bondage, for bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs, for male and female devotees  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">18</span></code> —this is called improper resort. Herein, what is [proper] resort? Here someone does not have prostitutes as resort … or taverns as resort; he does not dwell associated with kings … sectarians’ disciples, in unbecoming association with laymen; he cultivates, frequents, honours, such families as are faithful and trusting, who are a solace, where the yellow cloth glows, where the breeze of sages blows, who wish good, wish well, wish joy, wish surcease of bondage, for bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs, for male and female devotees—this is called [proper] resort. Thus he is furnished with, fully furnished with, provided with, fully provided with, supplied with, possessed of, endowed with, this [proper] conduct and this [proper] resort. Hence it is said, ’Possessed of [the proper] conduct and resort’” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vibh" id="id52"><span>[Vibh]</span></a> <em>246–247</em> ).</p>
<p id="i-46"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-46"><span class="std std-ref">§46</span></a> Furthermore, [proper] conduct and resort should also be understood here in the following way; for improper conduct is twofold as bodily and verbal. Herein, what is bodily improper conduct? “Here someone acts disrespectfully before the Community, and he stands jostling elder bhikkhus, sits jostling them, stands in front of them, sits in front of them, sits on a high seat, sits with his head covered, talks standing up, talks waving his arms … walks with sandals while elder bhikkhus walk without sandals, walks on a high walk while they walk on a low walk, walks on a walk while they walk on the ground … stands pushing elder bhikkhus, sits pushing them, prevents new bhikkhus from getting a seat … and in the bath house … without asking elder bhikkhus he puts wood on [the stove] … bolts the door … and at the bathing place he enters the water jostling elder bhikkhus, enters it in front of them, bathes jostling them, bathes in front of them, comes out jostling them, comes out in front of them … and entering inside a house he goes jostling elder bhikkhus, goes in front of them, pushing forward he goes in front of them … and where families have inner private screened rooms in which the women of the family … the girls of the family, sit, there he enters abruptly, and he strokes a child’s head” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#nidd" id="id53"><span>[Nidd]</span></a> <em>I 228–229</em> ). This is called bodily improper conduct.</p>
<p id="i-47"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-47"><span class="std std-ref">§47</span></a> Herein, what is verbal improper conduct? “Here someone acts disrespectfully before the Community. Without asking elder bhikkhus he talks on the Dhamma, answers questions, recites the Pātimokkha, talks standing up,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">19</span></code>  talks waving his arms … having entered inside a house, he speaks to a woman or a girl thus: ‘You, so-and-so*[21/79]*  of such-and-such a clan, what is there? Is there rice gruel? Is there cooked rice? Is there any hard food to eat? What shall we drink? What hard food shall we eat? What soft food shall we eat? Or what will you give me?’—he chatters like this” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#nidd" id="id54"><span>[Nidd]</span></a> <em>I 230</em> ). This is called verbal improper conduct.</p>
<p id="i-48"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-48"><span class="std std-ref">§48</span></a> Proper conduct should be understood in the opposite sense to that. Furthermore, a bhikkhu is respectful, deferential, possessed of conscience and shame, wears his inner robe properly, wears his upper robe properly, his manner inspires confidence whether in moving forwards or backwards, looking ahead or aside, bending or stretching, his eyes are downcast, he has (a good) deportment, he guards the doors of his sense faculties, knows the right measure in eating, is devoted to wakefulness, possesses mindfulness and full awareness, wants little, is contented, is strenuous, is a careful observer of good behaviour, and treats the teachers with great respect. This is called (proper) conduct.</p>
<p>This firstly is how (proper) conduct should be understood.</p>
<p id="i-49"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-49"><span class="std std-ref">§49</span></a> (Proper) resort is of three kinds: (proper) resort as support, (proper) resort as guarding, and (proper) resort as anchoring. Herein, what is (proper) resort as support? A good friend who exhibits the instances of talk, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id144" id="id55" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>53<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  in whose presence one hears what has not been heard, corrects what has been heard, gets rid of doubt, rectifies one’s view, and gains confidence; or by training under whom one grows in faith, virtue, learning, generosity and understanding—this is called (<em>proper</em>) <em>resort as support.</em></p>
<p id="i-50"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-50"><span class="std std-ref">§50</span></a> What is (proper) resort as guarding? Here “A bhikkhu, having entered inside a house, having gone into a street, goes with downcast eyes, seeing the length of a plough yoke, restrained, not looking at an elephant, not looking at a horse, a carriage, a pedestrian, a woman, a man, not looking up, not looking down, not staring this way and that” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#nidd" id="id56"><span>[Nidd]</span></a> <em>I 474</em> ). This is called (proper) resort as guarding.</p>
<p id="i-51"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-51"><span class="std std-ref">§51</span></a> What is (proper) resort as anchoring? It is the four foundations of mindfulness on which the mind is anchored; for this is said by the Blessed One: “Bhikkhus, what is a bhikkhu’s resort, his own native place? It is these four foundations of mindfulness” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id57"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>V 148</em> ). This is called (<em>proper</em>) <em>resort as anchoring</em>.</p>
<p>Being thus furnished with … endowed with, this (proper) conduct and this (proper) resort, he is also on that account called “one possessed of (proper) conduct and resort.”  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">20</span></code></p>
<p id="i-52"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-52"><span class="std std-ref">§52</span></a> <em>Seeing fear in the slightest fault</em> (<a class="reference internal" href="#i-42"><span class="std std-ref">§42</span></a>): one who has the habit (<em>sīla</em>) of seeing fear in faults of the minutest measure, of such kinds as unintentional contravening of a minor training rule of the Pātimokkha, or the arising of unprofitable thoughts. <em>He trains himself by undertaking</em> (<em>samādāya</em>) <em>the precepts of training:</em> whatever there is among the precepts of training to be trained in, in all that he trains by taking it up <em>[22/80]</em> rightly (<em>sammā ādāya</em>). And here, as far as the words, “one restrained by the Pātimokkha restraint,” virtue of Pātimokkha restraint is shown by discourse in terms of persons. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id146" id="id58" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>54<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  But all that beginning with the words, “possessed of [proper] conduct and resort” should be understood as said in order to show the way of practice that perfects that virtue in him who so practices it.</p>

<section id="b-virtue-of-restraint-of-the-sense-faculties">
<h5>7.4.1.2 (b) Virtue of restraint of the sense faculties</h5>
<p id="i-53"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-53"><span class="std std-ref">§53</span></a> (b) Now, as regards the virtue of restraint of faculties shown next to that in the way beginning, “on seeing a visible object with the eye,” herein <em>he</em> is a bhikkhu established in the virtue of Pātimokkha restraint. <em>On seeing a visible object with the eye</em>: on seeing a visible object with the eye-consciousness that is capable of seeing visible objects and has borrowed the name “eye” from its instrument. But the Ancients (<em>porāṇā</em>) said: “The eye does not see a visible object because it has no mind. The mind does not see because it has no eyes. But when there is the impingement of door and object he sees by means of the consciousness that has eye-sensitivity as its physical basis. Now, (an idiom) such as this is called an ‘accessory locution’ (<em>sasambhārakathā</em>), like ‘He shot him with his bow,’ and so on. So the meaning here is this: ‘On seeing a visible object with eye-consciousness.’” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id147" id="id59" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>55<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="i-54"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-54"><span class="std std-ref">§54</span></a> <em>Apprehends neither the signs</em>: he does not apprehend the sign of woman or man, or any sign that is a basis for defilement such as the sign of beauty, etc.; he stops at what is merely seen. <em>Nor the particulars:</em> he does not apprehend any aspect classed as hand, foot, smile, laughter, talk, looking ahead, looking aside, etc., which has acquired the name “particular” (<em>anubyañjana</em>) because of its particularizing (<em>anu anu byañjanato</em>) defilements, because of its making them manifest themselves. <em>[23/81]</em> He only apprehends what is really there. Like the Elder Mahā Tissa who dwelt at Cetiyapabbata.</p>
<p id="i-55"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-55"><span class="std std-ref">§55</span></a> It seems that as the elder was on his way from Cetiyapabbata to Anurādhapura for alms, a certain daughterinlaw of a clan, who had quarrelled with her husband and had set out early from Anurādhapura all dressed up and tricked out like a celestial nymph to go to her relatives’ home, saw him on the road, and being low-minded,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">21</span></code>  she laughed a loud laugh. [Wondering] “What is that?” the elder looked up and finding in the bones of her teeth the perception of foulness (ugliness), he reached Arahantship. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id150" id="id60" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>56<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> Hence it was said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“He saw the bones that were her teeth,</div>
<div class="line">And kept in mind his first perception;</div>
<div class="line">And standing on that very spot</div>
<div class="line">The elder became an Arahant.”</div>
</div>
<p>But her husband, who was going after her, saw the elder and asked, “Venerable sir, did you by any chance see a woman?” The elder told him:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“Whether it was a man or woman</div>
<div class="line">That went by I noticed not,</div>
<div class="line"><em>[24/82]</em> But only that on this high road</div>
<div class="line">There goes a group of bones.”</div>
</div>
<p id="i-56"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-56"><span class="std std-ref">§56</span></a> As to the words <em>through which</em>, etc., the meaning is: by reason of which, because of which non-restraint of the eye faculty, <em>if he</em>, if that person, <em>left the eye faculty unguarded</em>, remained with the eye door unclosed by the door-panel of mindfulness, these <em>states of covetousness</em>, etc., <em>might invade</em>, might pursue, might threaten, <em>him. He enters upon the way of its restraint</em>: he enters upon the way of closing that eye faculty by the door-panel of mindfulness. It is the same one of whom it is said <em>he guards the eye faculty, undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty</em>.</p>
<p id="i-57"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-57"><span class="std std-ref">§57</span></a> Herein, there is neither restraint nor non-restraint in the actual eye faculty, since neither mindfulness nor forgetfulness arises in dependence on eye-sensitivity. On the contrary when a visible datum as object comes into the eye’s focus, then, after the life-continuum has arisen twice and ceased, the functional mind-element accomplishing the function of adverting arises and ceases. After that, eye-consciousness with the function of seeing; after that, resultant mind-element with the function of receiving; after that, resultant root-causeless mind-consciousness-element with the function of investigating; after that, functional root-causeless mind-consciousness-element accomplishing the function of determining arises and ceases. Next to that, impulsion impels. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id152" id="id61" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>57<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  Herein, there is neither restraint nor non-restraint on the occasion of the life-continuum, or on any of the occasions beginning with adverting. But there is non-restraint if unvirtuousness or forgetfulness or unknowing or impatience or idleness arises at the moment of impulsion. When this happens, it is called “non-restraint in the eye faculty.”  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">22</span></code></p>
<p id="i-58"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-58"><span class="std std-ref">§58</span></a> Why is that? Because when this happens, the door is not guarded, nor are the life-continuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series. Like what? Just as, when a city’s four gates are not secured, although inside the city house doors, storehouses, rooms, etc., are secured, yet all property inside the city is unguarded and unprotected since robbers coming in by the city gates can do as they please, so too, when unvirtuousness, etc., arise in impulsion in which there is no restraint, then the door too is unguarded, and so also are the life-continuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with adverting. But when virtue, etc., has arisen in it, then the door too is guarded and so also are the life-continuum and the consciousnesses of <em>[25/83]</em> the cognitive series beginning with adverting. Like what? Just as, when the city gates are secured, although inside the city the houses, etc., are not secured, yet all property inside the city is well guarded, well protected, since when the city gates are shut there is no ingress for robbers, so too, when virtue, etc., have arisen in impulsion, the door too is guarded and so also are the life-continuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with adverting. Thus although it actually arises at the moment of impulsion, it is nevertheless called “restraint in the eye faculty.”</p>
<p id="i-59"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-59"><span class="std std-ref">§59</span></a> So also as regards the phrases <em>on hearing a sound with the ear</em> and so on. So it is this virtue, which in brief has the characteristic of avoiding apprehension of signs entailing defilement with respect to visible objects, etc., that should be understood as <em>virtue of restraint of faculties</em>.</p>

<h5>7.4.1.3 (c) Virtue of livelihood purification</h5>
<p id="i-60"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-60"><span class="std std-ref">§60</span></a> (c) Now, as regards the virtue of livelihood purification mentioned above next to the virtue of restraint of the faculties (<a class="reference internal" href="#i-42"><span class="std std-ref">§42</span></a>), the words <em>of the six precepts announced on account of livelihood</em> mean, of the following six training precepts announced thus: “With livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, one of evil wishes, a prey to wishes, lays claim to a higher than human state that is non-existent, not a fact,” the contravention of which is defeat (expulsion from the Order); “with livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, he acts as go-between,” the contravention of which is an offence entailing a meeting of the Order; “with livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, he says, ‘A bhikkhu who lives in your monastery is an Arahant,’” the contravention of which is a serious offence in one who is aware of it; “with livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, a bhikkhu who is not sick eats superior food that he has ordered for his own use,” the contravention of which is an offence requiring expiation: “With livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, a bhikkhunī who is not sick eats superior food that she has ordered for her own use,” the contravention of which is an offence requiring confession; “with livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, one who is not sick eats curry or boiled rice  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">23</span></code>  that he has ordered for his own use,” the contravention of which is an offence of wrongdoing ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vin" id="id62"><span>[Vin]</span></a> <em>V 146</em> ). Of these six precepts. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id154" id="id63" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>58<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="i-61"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-61"><span class="std std-ref">§61</span></a> As regards <em>scheming</em>, etc. (<a class="reference internal" href="#i-42"><span class="std std-ref">§42</span></a>), this is the text: “Herein, what is scheming?

<p id="i-62"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-62"><span class="std std-ref">§62</span></a> ”Herein, what is talking? Talking at others, talking, talking round, talking up, continual talking up, persuading, continual persuading, suggesting, continual suggesting, ingratiating chatter, flattery, bean-soupery, fondling, on the part of one bent on gain, honour and renown, of one of evil wishes, a prey to wishes—this is called talking.</p>

<p id="i-66"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-66"><span class="std std-ref">§66</span></a> The meaning of this text should be understood as follows: Firstly, as regards description of <em>scheming: on the part of one bent on gain, honour and renown</em> is on the part of one who is bent on gain, on honour, and on reputation; on the part of one who longs for them, is the meaning.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">24</span></code>  <em>Of one of evil wishes</em>: of one who wants to show qualities that he has not got. <em>A prey to wishes</em>: <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id157" id="id67" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>61<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  the meaning is, of one who is attacked by them. And after this the passage beginning <em>or by what is called rejection of requisites</em> is given in order to show the three instances of scheming given in the Mahāniddesa as rejection of requisites, indirect talk, and that based on deportment.</p>
<p id="i-67"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-67"><span class="std std-ref">§67</span></a> Herein, [a bhikkhu] is invited to accept robes, etc., and, precisely because he wants them, he refuses them out of evil wishes. And then, since he knows that those householders believe in him implicitly when they think, “Oh, how few are our lord’s wishes! He will not accept a thing!” and they put fine robes, etc., before him by various means, he then accepts, making a show that he wants to be compassionate towards them—it is this hypocrisy of his, which becomes the cause of their subsequently bringing them even by cartloads, that should be understood as the instance of scheming called rejection of requisites.</p>
<p id="i-68"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-68"><span class="std std-ref">§68</span></a> For this is said in the Mahāniddesa: “What is the instance of scheming called rejection of requisites? Here householders invite bhikkhus [to accept] robes, alms food, resting place, and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick. One who is of evil wishes, a prey to wishes, wanting robes … alms food … resting place … the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick, refuses robes … alms food … resting place … the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick, because he wants more. He says: ‘What has an ascetic to do with expensive robes? It is proper for an ascetic to gather rags from a charnel ground or from a rubbish heap or from a shop and make them into a patchwork cloak to wear. What has an ascetic to do with expensive <em>[27/85]</em> alms food? It is proper for an ascetic to get his living by the dropping of lumps [of food into his bowl] while he wanders for gleanings. What has an ascetic to do with an expensive resting place? It is proper for an ascetic to be a tree-root-dweller or an open-air-dweller. What has an ascetic to do with an expensive requisite of medicine as cure for the sick? It is proper for an ascetic to cure himself with putrid urine <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id158" id="id68" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>62<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  and broken gallnuts.’ Accordingly he wears a coarse robe, eats coarse alms food,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">25</span></code>  uses a coarse resting place, uses a coarse requisite of medicine as cure for the sick. Then householders think, ‘This ascetic has few wishes, is content, is secluded, keeps aloof from company, is strenuous, is a preacher of asceticism,’ and they invite him more and more [to accept] robes, alms food, resting places, and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick. He says: ‘With three things present a faithful clansman produces much merit: with faith present a faithful clansman produces much merit, with goods to be given present a faithful clansman produces much merit, with those worthy to receive present a faithful clansman produces much merit. You have faith; the goods to be given are here; and I am here to accept. If I do not accept, then you will be deprived of the merit. That is no good to me. Rather will I accept out of compassion for you.” Accordingly he accepts many robes, he accepts much alms food, he accepts many resting places, he accepts many requisites of medicine as cure for the sick. Such grimacing, grimacery, scheming, schemery, schemedness, is known as the instance of scheming called rejection of requisites’ ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#nidd" id="id69"><span>[Nidd]</span></a> <em>I 224–225</em> ).</p>

Here someone of evil wishes, a prey to wishes, eager to be admired, [thinking] ‘Thus people will admire me’ speaks words about the noble state.

One who has the habit of making grimaces is a grimacer. The grimacer’s state is <em>grimacery. Scheming</em> is hypocrisy. The way (<em>āyanā</em>) of a schemer (<em>kuha</em>) is <em>schemery</em> (<em>kuhāyanā</em>). The state of what is schemed is <em>schemedness</em>.</p>

<p id="i-73"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-73"><span class="std std-ref">§73</span></a> <em>Persuading</em> is progressively involving <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id161" id="id73" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>64<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  [people] thus, “Lay followers, formerly you used to give first-fruit alms at such a time; why do you not do so now?” until they say, “We shall give, venerable sir, we have had no opportunity,” etc.; entangling, is what is meant. Or alternatively, seeing someone with sugarcane in his hand, he asks, “Where are you coming from, lay follower?”—”From the sugarcane field, venerable sir”—”Is the sugarcane sweet there?”—”One can find out by eating, venerable sir”—”It is not allowed, lay follower, for bhikkhus to say ‘Give [me some] sugarcane.’” Such entangling talk from such an entangler is <em>persuading</em>.

<p id="i-74"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-74"><span class="std std-ref">§74</span></a> <em>Suggesting</em> is insinuating by specifying thus, “That family alone understands me; if there is anything to be given there, they give it to me only”; pointing to, is what is meant.

<p id="i-76"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-76"><span class="std std-ref">§76</span></a> <em>Fondling</em> is the state of the act of fondling.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">28</span></code>  For when a man fondles children on his lap or on his shoulder like a nurse—he nurses, is the meaning—that fondler’s act is the act of fondling.

<p id="i-77"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-77"><span class="std std-ref">§77</span></a> In the description of <em>hinting</em> (<em>nemittikatā</em>): a sign (<em>nimitta</em>) is any bodily or verbal act that gets others to give requisites. <em>Giving a sign</em> is making a sign such as “What have you got to eat?”, etc., on seeing [people] going along with food. <em>Indication</em> is talk that alludes to requisites. <em>Giving indication</em>: on seeing cowboys, he asks, “Are these milk cows’ calves or buttermilk cows’ calves?” and when it is said, “They are milk cows’ calves, venerable sir,” [he remarks] “They are not milk cows’ calves. If they were milk cows’ calves the bhikkhus would be getting milk,” etc.; and his getting it to the knowledge of the boys’ parents in this way, and so making them give milk, is <em>giving indication</em>.</p>
<p id="i-78"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-78"><span class="std std-ref">§78</span></a> <em>Indirect talk</em> is talk that keeps near [to the subject]. And here there should be told the story of the bhikkhu supported by a family. A bhikkhu, it seems, who was supported by a family went into the house wanting to eat and sat down. The mistress of the house was unwilling to give. On seeing him she said, “There is no rice,” and she went to a neighbour’s house as though to get rice. The bhikkhu went into the storeroom. Looking round, he saw sugarcane in the corner behind the door, sugar in a bowl, a string of salt fish in a basket, rice in a jar, and ghee in a pot. He came out and sat down. When the housewife came back, she said, “I did not get any rice.” The bhikkhu said, “Lay follower, I saw a sign just now that alms will not be easy to get today.”—“What, venerable sir?”—”I saw a snake that was like sugarcane put in the corner behind the door; looking for something to hit it with, I saw a stone like a lump of sugar in a bowl. When the snake had been hit with the clod, it spread out a hood like a string of salt fish in a basket, and its teeth as it tried to bite the clod were like rice grains in a jar. Then the saliva mixed with poison that came out to its mouth in its fury was like ghee put in a pot.” She thought, “There is no hoodwinking the shaveling,” so she gave him the sugarcane  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">29</span></code>  and she cooked the rice and gave it all to him with the ghee, the sugar and the fish.</p>
<p id="i-79"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-79"><span class="std std-ref">§79</span></a> Such talk that keeps near [to the subject] should be understood as indirect talk. <em>Roundabout talk</em> is talking round and round [the subject] as much as is allowed.</p>
<p id="i-80"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-80"><span class="std std-ref">§80</span></a> In the description of <em>belittling: abusing</em> is abusing by means of the ten instances of abuse. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id165" id="id75" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>66<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  <em>Disparaging</em> is contemptuous talk. <em>Reproaching</em> is enumeration of faults such as “He is faithless, he is an unbeliever.” <em>Snubbing</em> is taking up verbally thus, <em>[30/88]</em> “Don’t say that here.” Snubbing in all ways, giving grounds and reasons, is <em>continual snubbing</em>. Or alternatively, when someone does not give, taking him up thus, “Oh, the prince of givers!” is <em>snubbing;</em> and the thorough snubbing thus, “A mighty prince of givers!” is <em>continual snubbing. Ridicule</em> is making fun of someone thus, “What sort of a life has this man who eats up his seed [grain]?” <em>Continual ridicule</em> is making fun of him more thoroughly thus, “What, you say this man is not a giver who always gives the words ‘There is nothing’ to everyone?”</p>
<p id="i-81"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-81"><span class="std std-ref">§81</span></a> <em>Denigration</em> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id168" id="id76" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>67<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  <em>is denigrating someone by saying that he is not a giver, or by censuring him.

This is called <em>belittling</em> (<em>nippesikatā</em>) because it scrapes off (<em>nippeseti</em>), wipes off, the virtuous qualities of others as a bamboo scraper (<em>veḷupesikā</em>) does unguent, or because it is a pursuit of gain by grinding (<em>nippiṃsitvā</em>) and pulverizing others’ virtuous qualities, like the pursuit of perfume by grinding perfumed substances; that is why it is called <em>belittling</em>.</p>
<p id="i-82"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-82"><span class="std std-ref">§82</span></a> In the description of <em>pursuing gain with gain: pursuing</em> is hunting after. <em>Got from here</em> is got from this house. <em>There</em> is into that house. <em>Seeking</em> is wanting. <em>Seeking for</em> is hunting after. <em>Seeking out</em> is hunting after again and again.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">30</span></code>  The story of the bhikkhu who went round giving away the alms he had got at first to children of families here and there and in the end got milk and gruel should be told here. <em>Searching</em>, etc., are synonyms for “seeking,” etc., and so the construction here should be understood thus: <em>going in search of</em> is seeking; <em>searching for</em> is seeking for; <em>searching out</em> is seeking out.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of <em>scheming,</em> and so on.</p>
<p id="i-83"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-83"><span class="std std-ref">§83</span></a> Now, [as regards the words] <em>The evil states beginning with</em> (<a class="reference internal" href="#i-42"><span class="std std-ref">§42</span></a>): here the words <em>beginning with</em> should be understood to include the many evil states given in the Brahmajāla Sutta in the way beginning, “Or just as some worthy ascetics, while eating the food given by the faithful, make a living by wrong livelihood, by such low arts as these, that is to say, by palmistry, by fortune-telling, by divining omens, by interpreting dreams, marks on the body, holes gnawed by mice; by fire sacrifice, by spoon oblation …” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#d" id="id77"><span>[D]</span></a> <em>I 9</em> ).</p>
<p id="i-84"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-84"><span class="std std-ref">§84</span></a> <em>[31/89]</em> So this wrong livelihood entails the transgression of these six training precepts announced on account of livelihood, and it entails the evil states beginning with “Scheming, talking, hinting, belittling, pursuing gain with gain.” And so it is the abstinence from all sorts of wrong livelihood that is <em>virtue of livelihood purification</em>, the word-meaning of which is this: on account of it they live, thus it is livelihood. What is that? It is the effort consisting in the search for requisites. “Purification” is purifiedness. “Livelihood purification” is purification of livelihood.</p>

<h5>7.4.1.4 (d) Virtue concerning requisites</h5>
<p id="i-85"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-85"><span class="std std-ref">§85</span></a> (d) As regards the next kind called <em>virtue concerning requisites</em>, [here is the text: “Reflecting wisely, he uses the robe only for protection from cold, for protection from heat, for protection from contact with gadflies, flies, wind, burning and creeping things, and only for the purpose of concealing the private parts. Reflecting wisely, he uses alms food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for smartening nor for embellishment, but only for the endurance and continuance of this body, for the ending of discomfort, and for assisting the life of purity: ‘Thus I shall put a stop to old feelings and shall not arouse new feelings, and I shall be healthy and blameless and live in comfort.’ Reflecting wisely, he uses the resting place only for the purpose of protection from cold, for protection from heat, for protection from contact with gadflies, flies, wind, burning and creeping things, and only for the purpose of warding off the perils of climate and enjoying retreat. Reflecting wisely, he uses the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick only for protection from arisen hurtful feelings and for complete immunity from affliction” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id78"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 10</em> ). Herein, <em>reflecting wisely</em> is reflecting as the means and as the way; <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id170" id="id79" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>68<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  by knowing, by reviewing, is the meaning. And here it is the reviewing stated in the way beginning, “For protection from cold” that should be understood as “reflecting wisely.”</p>
<p id="i-86"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-86"><span class="std std-ref">§86</span></a> Herein, <em>the robe</em> is any one of those beginning with the inner cloth. <em>He uses</em>: he employs; dresses in [as inner cloth], or puts on [as upper garment]. <em>Only</em>  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">31</span></code>  is a phrase signifying invariability in the definition of a limit <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id172" id="id80" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>69<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  of a purpose; the purpose in the meditator’s making use of the robes is that much only, namely, protection from cold, etc., not more than that. <em>From cold</em>: from any kind of cold arisen either through disturbance of elements internally or through change in temperature externally. <em>For protection</em>: for the purpose of warding off; for the purpose of eliminating it so that it may not arouse affliction in the body. For when the body is afflicted by cold, the distracted mind cannot be wisely exerted. That is why the Blessed One permitted the robe to be used for protection from cold. So in each instance, except that <em>from heat</em> means from the heat of fire, the origin of which should be understood as forest fires, and so on.</p>
<p id="i-87"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-87"><span class="std std-ref">§87</span></a> <em>From contact with gadflies and flies, wind and burning and creeping things:</em> here <em>gadflies</em> are flies that bite; they are also called “blind flies.” <em>Flies</em> are just flies. <em>Wind</em> is distinguished as that with dust and that without dust. <em>Burning</em> is burning of the sun. <em>Creeping things</em> are any long creatures such as snakes and so on that move by crawling. Contact with them is of two kinds: contact by being bitten and contact <em>[32/90]</em> by being touched. And that does not worry him who sits with a robe on. So he uses it for the purpose of protection from such things.</p>
<p id="i-88"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-88"><span class="std std-ref">§88</span></a> <em>Only</em>: the word is repeated in order to define a subdivision of the invariable purpose; for the concealment of the private parts is an invariable purpose; the others are purposes periodically. Herein, <em>private parts</em> are any parts of the pudendum. For when a member is disclosed, conscience (<em>hiri</em>) is disturbed (<em>kuppati</em>), offended. It is called “private parts” (<em>hirikopīna</em>) because of the disturbance of conscience (<em>hiri-kopana</em>). <em>For the purpose of concealing the private parts:</em> for the purpose of the concealment of those private parts. [As well as the reading “<em>hiriko-pīna-paṭicchādanatthaṃ</em>] there is a reading “<em>hirikopīnaṃ paṭicchādanatthaṃ</em>.”</p>
<p id="i-89"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-89"><span class="std std-ref">§89</span></a> <em>Alms food</em> is any sort of food. For any sort of nutriment is called “alms food” (<em>piṇḍapāta—</em>lit. “lump-dropping”) because of its having been dropped (<em>patitattā</em>) into a bhikkhu’s bowl during his alms round (<em>piṇḍolya</em>). Or alms food (<em>piṇḍapāta</em>) is the dropping (<em>pāta</em>) of the lumps (<em>piṇḍa</em>); it is the concurrence (<em>sannipāta</em>), the collection, of alms (<em>bhikkhā</em>) obtained here and there, is what is meant.</p>
<p><em>Neither for amusement</em>: neither for the purpose of amusement, as with village boys, etc.; for the sake of sport, is what is meant. <em>Nor for intoxication</em>: not for the purpose of intoxication, as with boxers, etc.; for the sake of intoxication with strength and for the sake of intoxication with manhood, is what is meant.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">32</span></code>  <em>Nor for smartening</em>: not for the purpose of smartening, as with royal concubines, courtesans, etc.; for the sake of plumpness in all the limbs, is what is meant. <em>Nor for embellishment</em>: not for the purpose of embellishment, as with actors, dancers, etc.; for the sake of a clear skin and complexion, is what is meant.</p>
<p id="i-90"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-90"><span class="std std-ref">§90</span></a> And here the clause <em>neither for amusement</em> is stated for the purpose of abandoning support for delusion; <em>nor for intoxication</em> is said for the purpose of abandoning support for hate; <em>nor for smartening nor for embellishment</em> is said for the purpose of abandoning support for greed. And <em>neither for amusement nor for intoxication</em> is said for the purpose of preventing the arising of fetters for oneself. <em>Nor for smartening nor for embellishment</em> is said for the purpose of preventing the arising of fetters for another. And the abandoning of both unwise practice and devotion to indulgence of sense pleasures should be understood as stated by these four. <em>Only</em> has the meaning already stated.</p>
<p id="i-91"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-91"><span class="std std-ref">§91</span></a> <em>Of this body</em>: of this material body consisting of the four great primaries. <em>For the endurance</em>: for the purpose of continued endurance. <em>And continuance</em>: for the purpose of not interrupting [life’s continued] occurrence, or for the purpose of endurance for a long time. He makes use of the alms food for the purpose of the endurance, for the purpose of the continuance, of the body, as the owner of an old house uses props for his house, and as a carter uses axle grease, not for the purpose of amusement, intoxication, smartening, and embellishment. Furthermore, endurance is a term for the life faculty. So what has been said as far as the words <em>for the endurance and continuance of this body</em> can be understood to mean: for the purpose of maintaining the occurrence of the life faculty in this body.</p>
<p id="i-92"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-92"><span class="std std-ref">§92</span></a> <em>For the ending of discomfort</em>: hunger is called “discomfort” in the sense of afflicting. He makes use of alms food for the purpose of ending that, like anointing <em>[33/91]</em> a wound, like counteracting heat with cold, and so on. <em>For assisting the life of purity</em>: for the purpose of assisting the life of purity consisting in the whole dispensation and the life of purity consisting in the path. For while this [bhikkhu] is engaged in crossing the desert of existence by means of devotion to the three trainings depending on bodily strength whose necessary condition is the use of alms food, he makes use of it to assist the life of purity just as those seeking to cross the desert used their child’s flesh, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id174" id="id81" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>70<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  just as those seeking to cross a river use a raft, and just as those seeking to cross the ocean use a ship.</p>
<p id="i-93"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-93"><span class="std std-ref">§93</span></a> <em>Thus I shall put a stop to old feelings and shall not arouse new feelings</em>:  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">33</span></code>  thus as a sick man uses medicine, he uses [alms food, thinking]: “By use of this alms food I shall put a stop to the old feeling of hunger, and I shall not arouse a new feeling by immoderate eating, like one of the [proverbial] brahmans, that is, one who eats till he has to be helped up by hand, or till his clothes will not meet, or till he rolls there [on the ground], or till crows can peck from his mouth, or until he vomits what he has eaten. Or alternatively, there is that which is called ‘old feelings’ because, being conditioned by former kamma, it arises now in dependence on unsuitable immoderate eating—I shall put a stop to that old feeling, forestalling its condition by suitable moderate eating. And there is that which is called ‘new feeling’ because it will arise in the future in dependence on the accumulation of kamma consisting in making improper use [of the requisite of alms food] now—I shall also not arouse that new feeling, avoiding by means of proper use the production of its root.” This is how the meaning should be understood here. What has been shown so far can be understood to include proper use [of requisites], abandoning of devotion to self-mortification, and not giving up lawful bliss (pleasure).</p>
<p id="i-94"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-94"><span class="std std-ref">§94</span></a> <em>And I shall be healthy</em>: “In this body, which exists in dependence on requisites, I shall, by moderate eating, have health called ‘long endurance’ since there will be no danger of severing the life faculty or interrupting the [continuity of the] postures.” [Reflecting] in this way, he makes use [of the alms food] as a sufferer from a chronic disease does of his medicine. <em>And blameless and live in comfort</em> (lit. “and have blamelessness and a comfortable abiding”): he makes use of them thinking: “I shall have blamelessness by avoiding improper search, acceptance and eating, and I shall have a comfortable abiding by moderate eating.” Or he does so thinking: “I shall have blamelessness due to absence of such faults as boredom, sloth, sleepiness, blame by the wise, etc., that have unseemly immoderate eating as their condition; and I shall have a comfortable abiding by producing bodily strength that has seemly moderate eating as its condition.” Or he does so thinking: “I shall have blamelessness by abandoning the pleasure of lying down, lolling and torpor, through refraining from eating as much as possible to stuff the belly; and I shall have a comfortable abiding by controlling the four postures through eating four or five mouthfuls less than the maximum.” For this is said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>[34/92]</em> With four or five lumps still to eat</div>
<div class="line">Let him then end by drinking water;</div>
<div class="line">For energetic bhikkhus’ needs</div>
<div class="line">This should suffice to live in comfort ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#th" id="id82"><span>[Th]</span></a> <em>983</em> ).  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">34</span></code></div>
</div>
<p>Now, what has been shown at this point can be understood as discernment of purpose and practice of the middle way.</p>
<p id="i-95"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-95"><span class="std std-ref">§95</span></a> <em>Resting place</em> (<em>senāsana</em>): this is the bed (<em>sena</em>) and seat (<em>āsana</em>). For wherever one sleeps (<em>seti</em>), whether in a monastery or in a lean-to, etc., that is the bed (<em>sena</em>); wherever one seats oneself (<em>āsati</em>), sits <em>(nisīdati</em>), that is the seat (<em>āsana</em>). Both together are called “resting-place” (or “abode”—<em>senāsana</em>).</p>
<p><em>For the purpose of warding off the perils of climate and enjoying retreat</em>: the climate itself in the sense of imperilling (<em>parisahana</em>) is “perils of climate” (<em>utu-parissaya</em>). Unsuitable climatic conditions that cause mental distraction due to bodily affliction can be warded off by making use of the resting place; it is for the purpose of warding off these and for the purpose of the pleasure of solitude, is what is meant. Of course, the warding off of the perils of climate is stated by [the phrase] “protection from cold,” etc., too; but, just as in the case of making use of the robes the concealment of the private parts is stated as an invariable purpose while the others are periodical [purposes], so here also this [last] should be understood as mentioned with reference to the invariable warding off of the perils of climate. Or alternatively, this “climate” of the kind stated is just climate; but “perils” are of two kinds: evident perils and concealed perils (see  <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#nidd" id="id83"><span>[Nidd]</span></a> <em>I 12</em> ). Herein, evident perils are lions, tigers, etc., while concealed perils are greed, hate, and so on. When a bhikkhu knows and reflects thus in making use of the kind of resting place where these [perils] do not, owing to unguarded doors and sight of unsuitable visible objects, etc., cause affliction, he can be understood as one who “reflecting wisely makes use of the resting place for the purpose of warding off the perils of climate.”</p>
<p id="i-96"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-96"><span class="std std-ref">§96</span></a> <em>The requisite of medicine as cure for the sick</em>: here “cure” (<em>paccaya =</em> going against) is in the sense of going against (<em>pati-ayana</em>) illness; in the sense of countering, is the meaning. This is a term for any suitable remedy. It is the medical man’s work (<em>bhisakkassa kammaṃ</em>) because it is permitted by him, thus it is medicine (<em>bhesajja</em>). Or the cure for the sick itself as medicine is “medicine as cure for the sick.” Any work of a medical man such as oil, honey, ghee, etc., that is suitable for one who is sick, is what is meant. A “requisite” (<em>parikkhāra</em>), however, in such passages as “It is well supplied with the requisites of a city” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id84"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>IV 106</em> ) is equipment; in such passages as “The chariot has the requisite of virtue, the axle of jhāna, the wheel of energy” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id85"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>V 6</em> )  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">35</span></code>  it is an ornament; in such passages as “The requisites for the life of one who has gone into homelessness that should be available” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id86"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 104</em> ), it is an accessory. But here both equipment and accessory are applicable. For that medicine as a cure for the sick is equipment for maintaining life because it protects by preventing the arising of affliction destructive to life; and it is an accessory too because it is an instrument for prolonging life. That is why it is called “requisite.” So it is medicine as cure for the sick and that is a requisite, thus it is a “requisite of medicine as cure for the sick.” [He makes use of] that requisite of medicine as cure <em>[35/93]</em> for the sick; any requisite for life consisting of oil, honey, molasses, ghee, etc., that is allowed by a medical man as suitable for the sick, is what is meant.</p>
<p id="i-97"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-97"><span class="std std-ref">§97</span></a> <em>From arisen</em>: from born, become, produced. <em>Hurtful:</em> here “hurt (affliction)” is a disturbance of elements, and it is the leprosy, tumours, boils, etc., originated by that disturbance. <em>Hurtful</em> (<em>veyyābādhika</em>) because arisen in the form of hurt (<em>byābādha</em>). <em>Feelings</em>: painful feelings, feelings resulting from unprofitable kamma—from those hurtful feelings. <em>For complete immunity from affliction</em>: for complete freedom from pain; so that all that is painful is abandoned, is the meaning.</p>
<p>This is how this <em>virtue concerning requisites</em> should be understood. In brief its characteristic is the use of requisites after wise reflection. The word-meaning here is this: because breathing things go (<em>ayanti</em>), move, proceed, using [what they use] in dependence on these robes, etc., these robes, etc., are therefore called requisites (<em>paccaya =</em> ger. of <em>paṭi + ayati</em>); “concerning requisites” is concerning those requisites.</p>

<p id="i-98"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-98"><span class="std std-ref">§98</span></a> (a) So, in this fourfold virtue, <em>Pātimokkha restraint</em> has to be undertaken by means of faith. For that is accomplished by faith, since the announcing of training precepts is outside the disciples’ province; and the evidence here is the refusal of the request to [allow disciples to] announce training precepts (see  <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vin" id="id87"><span>[Vin]</span></a> <em>III 9–10</em> ). Having therefore undertaken through faith the training precepts without exception as announced, one should completely perfect them without regard for life. For this is said:  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">36</span></code></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“As a hen guards her eggs,</div>
<div class="line">Or as a yak her tail,</div>

<p>Also it is said further: “So too, sire, when a training precept for disciples is announced by me, my disciples do not transgress it even for the sake of life” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id88"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>IV 201</em> ).</p>
<p id="i-99"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-99"><span class="std std-ref">§99</span></a> And the story of the elders bound by robbers in the forest should be understood in this sense.</p>
<p>It seems that robbers in the Mahāvaṭṭanī Forest bound an elder with black creepers and made him lie down. While he lay there for seven days he augmented his insight, and after reaching the fruition of non-return, he died there and was reborn in the Brahmā-world. Also they bound another elder in Tambapaṇṇi Island (Sri Lanka) with string creepers and made him lie down. When a forest fire came and the creepers were not cut, he established insight and attained Nibbāna simultaneously with his death. When the Elder Abhaya, a preacher of the Dīgha Nikāya, passed by with five hundred bhikkhus, he saw [what had happened] and he had the elder’s body cremated and a shrine built. Therefore let other clansmen also:</p>
<div class="line-block">

<p id="i-100"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-100"><span class="std std-ref">§100</span></a> (b) And as Pātimokkha restraint is undertaken out of faith, so <em>restraint of the sense faculties</em> should be undertaken with <em>mindfulness</em>. For that is accomplished by mindfulness, because when the sense faculties’ functions are founded on mindfulness, there is no liability to invasion by covetousness and the rest. So, recollecting the Fire Discourse, which begins thus, “Better, bhikkhus, the extirpation of the eye faculty by a red-hot burning blazing glowing iron spike than the apprehension of signs in the particulars of visible objects cognizable by the eye” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id89"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>IV 168</em> ), this [restraint] should be properly undertaken by preventing with unremitting mindfulness any apprehension, in the objective fields consisting of visible data, etc., of any signs, etc., likely to encourage covetousness, etc., to invade consciousness occurring in connection with the eye door, and so on.</p>
<p id="i-101"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-101"><span class="std std-ref">§101</span></a>  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">37</span></code>  When not undertaken thus, virtue of Pātimokkha restraint is unenduring: it does not last, like a crop not fenced in with branches.

</div>
<p id="i-103"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-103"><span class="std std-ref">§103</span></a> This, however, is the teaching at its very highest.</p>
<p>This mind is called “quickly transformed” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id92"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>I 10</em> ), so restraint of the faculties should be undertaken by removing arisen lust with the contemplation of foulness, as was done by the Elder Vaṅgīsa soon after he had gone forth.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">38</span></code></p>
<p>As the elder was wandering for alms, it seems, soon after going forth, lust arose in him on seeing a woman. Thereupon he said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>[37/95]</em> “I am afire with sensual lust.</div>
<div class="line">And burning flames consume my mind;</div>

</div>
<p>The elder said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“You do perceive mistakenly,</div>
<div class="line">That burning flames consume your mind.</div>
<div class="line">Look for no sign of beauty there,</div>

<div class="line">See foulness there and keep your mind</div>
<div class="line">Harmoniously concentrated;</div>
<div class="line">Formations see as alien,</div>
<div class="line">As ill, not self, so this great lust</div>
<div class="line">May be extinguished, and no more</div>
<div class="line">Take fire thus ever and again” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id94"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>I 188</em> ).</div>
</div>
<p>The elder expelled his lust and then went on with his alms round.</p>
<p id="i-104"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-104"><span class="std std-ref">§104</span></a> Moreover, a bhikkhu who is fulfilling restraint of the faculties should be like the Elder Cittagutta resident in the Great Cave at Kuraṇḍaka, and like the Elder Mahā Mitta resident at the Great Monastery of Coraka.</p>
<p id="i-105"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-105"><span class="std std-ref">§105</span></a> In the Great Cave of Kuraṇḍaka, it seems, there was a lovely painting of the Renunciation of the Seven Buddhas. A number of bhikkhus wandering about among the dwellings saw the painting and said, “What a lovely painting, venerable sir!” The elder said: “For more than sixty years, friends, I have lived in the cave, and I did not know whether there was any painting there or not. Now, today, I know it through those who have eyes.” The elder, it seems, though he had lived there for so long, had never raised his eyes and looked up at the cave. And at the door of his cave there was a great ironwood tree. And the elder had never looked up at that either. He knew it was in flower when he saw its petals on the ground each year.</p>
<p id="i-106"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-106"><span class="std std-ref">§106</span></a> The king heard of the elder’s great virtues, and he sent for him three times, desiring to pay homage to him. When the elder did not go, he had the breasts of all the women with infants in the town bound and sealed off, [saying] “As long as the elder does not come let the children go without milk,”  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">39</span></code>  Out of compassion for the children the elder went to Mahāgāma. When the king heard [that he had come, he said] “Go and bring the elder in. I shall take the precepts.” Having had him brought up into the inner palace, he paid homage to him and provided him with a meal. Then, saying, “Today, venerable sir, there is no opportunity. I shall take the precepts tomorrow,” he took the elder’s bowl. After following him for a little, he paid homage with the queen and turned back. As seven days went by thus, whether it was the king who paid homage or whether it was the queen, the elder said, “May the king be happy.”</p>
<p id="i-107"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-107"><span class="std std-ref">§107</span></a> Bhikkhus asked: “Why is it, venerable sir, that whether it is the king who pays the homage or the queen you say ‘May the king be happy’?” The elder replied: “Friends, I do not notice whether it is the king or the queen.” At the end of seven days [when it was found that] the elder was not happy living there, he was dismissed <em>[38/96]</em> by the king. He went back to the Great Cave at Kuraṇḍaka. When it was night he went out onto his walk. A deity who dwelt in the ironwood tree stood by with a torch of sticks. Then his meditation subject became quite clear and plain. The elder, [thinking] “How clear my meditation subject is today!” was glad, and immediately after the middle watch he reached Arahantship, making the whole rock resound. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id177" id="id95" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>71<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

The elder said: “I do not know how to gather root medicines and such things and concoct a medicine from them. But rather I will tell you a medicine: since I went forth I have not broken [my virtue of restraint of] the sense faculties by looking at the bodily form of the opposite sex with a lustful mind. By this  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">40</span></code>  declaration of truth may my mother get well. Go and tell the lay devotee and rub her body.” She went and told her what had happened and then did as she had been instructed. At that very moment the lay devotee’s tumour vanished, shrinking away like a lump of froth. She got up and uttered a cry of joy: “If the Fully Enlightened One were still alive, why should he not stroke with his netadorned hand the head of a bhikkhu like my son?” So:</p>

<section id="c-livelihood-purification-by-means-of-energy">
<h5>7.4.1.7 (c) Livelihood purification by means of energy</h5>
<p id="i-111"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-111"><span class="std std-ref">§111</span></a> (c) As restraint of the faculties is to be undertaken by means of mindfulness, so <em>livelihood purification</em> is to be undertaken by means of <em>energy</em>. For that is accomplished by energy, because the abandoning of wrong livelihood is effected in one who has rightly applied energy. Abandoning, therefore, unbefitting wrong search, this should be undertaken with energy by means of the right kind of search consisting in going on alms round, etc., avoiding what is of impure origin as though it were a poisonous snake, and using only requisites of pure origin.</p>
<p id="i-112"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-112"><span class="std std-ref">§112</span></a> Herein, for one who has not taken up the ascetic practices, any requisites obtained from the Community, from a group of bhikkhus, or from laymen who have confidence in his special qualities of teaching the Dhamma, etc., are called “of pure origin.” But <em>[39/97]</em> those obtained on alms round, etc., are of extremely pure origin. For one who has taken up the ascetic practices, those obtained on alms round, etc., and—as long as this is in accordance with the rules of the ascetic practices—from people who have confidence in his special qualities of asceticism, are called “of pure origin.” And if he has got putrid urine with mixed gall nuts and “four-sweets” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id179" id="id96" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>72<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  for the purpose of curing a certain affliction, and he eats only the broken gall nuts, thinking, “Other companions in the life of purity will eat the ‘four-sweets’,” his undertaking of the ascetic practices is befitting, for he is then called a bhikkhu who is supreme in the Noble Ones’ heritages ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id97"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>II 28</em> ).</p>
<p id="i-113"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-113"><span class="std std-ref">§113</span></a> As to the robe and the other requisites, no hint, indication, roundabout talk, or intimation about robes and alms food is allowable for a bhikkhu who is purifying his livelihood. But a hint, indication, or roundabout talk about a resting place is allowable for one who has not taken up the ascetic practices.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">41</span></code></p>
<p id="i-114"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-114"><span class="std std-ref">§114</span></a> Herein, a “hint” is when one who is getting the preparing of the ground, etc., done for the purpose of [making] a resting place is asked, “What is being done, venerable sir? Who is having it done?” and he replies, “No one”; or any other such giving of hints. An “indication” is saying, “Lay follower, where do you live?”—”In a mansion, venerable sir”—”But, lay follower, a mansion is not allowed for bhikkhus.” Or any other such giving of indication. “Roundabout talk” is saying, “The resting place for the Community of Bhikkhus is crowded”; or any other such oblique talk.</p>
<p id="i-115"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-115"><span class="std std-ref">§115</span></a> All, however, is allowed in the case of medicine. But when the disease is cured, is it or is it not allowed to use the medicine obtained in this way? Herein, the Vinaya specialists say that the opening has been given by the Blessed One, therefore it is allowable. But the Suttanta specialists say that though there is no offence, nevertheless the livelihood is sullied, therefore it is not allowable.</p>
<p id="i-116"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-116"><span class="std std-ref">§116</span></a> But one who does not use hints, indications, roundabout talk, or intimation, though these are permitted by the Blessed One, and who depends only on the special qualities of fewness of wishes, etc., and makes use only of requisites obtained otherwise than by indication, etc., even when he thus risks his life, is called supreme in living in effacement, like the venerable Sāriputta.</p>
<p id="i-117"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-117"><span class="std std-ref">§117</span></a> It seems that the venerable one was cultivating seclusion at one time, living in a certain forest with the Elder Mahā Moggallāna. One day an affliction of colic arose in him, causing him great pain. In the evening the Elder Mahā Moggallāna went to attend upon him. Seeing him lying down, he asked what the reason was. And then he asked, “What used to make you better formerly, friend?” The elder said, “When I was a layman, friend, my mother used to mix ghee, honey, sugar and so on, and give me rice gruel with pure milk. That used to make me better.” Then the other said, “So be it, friend. If either you or I have merit, perhaps tomorrow we shall get some.”</p>
<p id="i-118"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-118"><span class="std std-ref">§118</span></a> Now, a deity who dwelt in a tree at the end of the walk overheard their conversation. [Thinking] “I will find rice gruel for the lord tomorrow,” he went <em>[40/98]</em> meanwhile to the family who was supporting the elder  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">42</span></code>  and entered into the body of the eldest son, causing him discomfort. Then he told the assembled relatives the price of the cure: “If you prepare rice gruel of such a kind tomorrow for the elder, I will set this one free.” They said: “Even without being told by you we regularly supply the elder’s needs,” and on the following day they prepared rice gruel of the kind needed.</p>
<p id="i-119"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-119"><span class="std std-ref">§119</span></a> The Elder Mahā Moggallāna came in the morning and said, “Stay here, friend, till I come back from the alms round.” Then he went into the village. Those people met him. They took his bowl, filled it with the stipulated kind of rice gruel, and gave it back to him. The elder made as though to go, but they said, “Eat, venerable sir, we shall give you more.” When the elder had eaten, they gave him another bowlful. The elder left. Bringing the alms food to the venerable Sāriputta, he said, “Here, friend Sāriputta, eat.” When the elder saw it, he thought, “The gruel is very nice. How was it got?” and seeing how it had been obtained, he said, “Friend, the alms food cannot be used.”</p>
<p id="i-120"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-120"><span class="std std-ref">§120</span></a> Instead of thinking, “He does not eat alms food brought by the likes of me,” the other at once took the bowl by the rim and turned it over on one side. As the rice gruel fell on the ground the elder’s affliction vanished. From then on it did not appear again during forty-five years.</p>
<p id="i-121"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-121"><span class="std std-ref">§121</span></a> Then he said to the venerable Mahā Moggallāna, “Friend, even if one’s bowels come out and trail on the ground, it is not fitting to eat gruel got by verbal intimation,” and he uttered this exclamation:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">My livelihood might well be blamed</div>
<div class="line">If I were to consent to eat</div>
<div class="line">The honey and the gruel obtained</div>
<div class="line">By influence of verbal hints.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And even if my bowels obtrude</div>
<div class="line">And trail outside, and even though</div>

<div class="line">I will not blot my livelihood ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#mil" id="id98"><span>[Mil]</span></a> <em>370</em> ).</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For I will satisfy my heart</div>
<div class="line">By shunning all wrong kinds of search;</div>
<div class="line">And never will I undertake</div>
<div class="line">The search the Buddhas have condemned.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">43</span></code></div>

<p id="i-122"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-122"><span class="std std-ref">§122</span></a> And here too should be told the story of the Elder Mahā Tissa the Mango-eater who lived at Cīragumba <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id180" id="id99" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>73<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  (see <a class="reference internal" href="#i-132"><span class="std std-ref">§132</span></a> below).

<section id="d-virtue-dependent-on-requisites-by-means-of-understanding">
<h5>7.4.1.8 (d) Virtue dependent on requisites by means of understanding</h5>
<p id="i-123"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-123"><span class="std std-ref">§123</span></a> (d) And as livelihood purification is to be undertaken by means of energy, so <em>virtue dependent on requisites</em> is to be undertaken by means of <em>understanding</em>. For that is accomplished by understanding, because one who possesses understanding is able to see the advantages and the dangers in requisites. So one should abandon greed for requisites and undertake that virtue by using requisites obtained lawfully and properly, after reviewing them with understanding in the way aforesaid.</p>
<p id="i-124"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-124"><span class="std std-ref">§124</span></a> Herein, reviewing is of two kinds: at the time of receiving requisites and at the time of using them. For use (<em>paribhoga</em>) is blameless in one who at the time of receiving robes, etc., reviews them either as [mere] elements or as repulsive, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id183" id="id100" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>74<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  and puts them aside for later use, and in one who reviews them thus at the time of using them.</p>
<p id="i-125"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-125"><span class="std std-ref">§125</span></a> Here is an explanation to settle the matter. There are four kinds of use: use as theft, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id185" id="id101" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>75<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  use as a debt?, use as an inheritance, use as a master. Herein, use by one who is unvirtuous and makes use [of requisites], even sitting in the midst of the Community, is called “use as theft.” Use without reviewing by one who is virtuous is “use as a debt”; therefore the robe should be reviewed every time it is used, and the alms food lump by lump. One who cannot do this [should review it] before the meal, after the meal, in the first watch, in the middle watch, and in the last watch. If dawn breaks on him without his having reviewed it, he finds himself in the position of one who has used it as a debt. Also the resting place should be reviewed each time it is used. Recourse to mindfulness both in the accepting and the use of medicine is proper; but while this is so, though there is an offence for one who uses it without mindfulness after mindful acceptance, there is no offence for one who is mindful in using after accepting without mindfulness.</p>
<p id="i-126"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-126"><span class="std std-ref">§126</span></a> Purification is of four kinds: purification by the Teaching, purification by restraint, purification by search, and purification by reviewing. Herein, <em>virtue of</em> <em>[42/100]</em> <em>the Pātimokkha restraint</em> is called “purification by the Teaching”;  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">44</span></code>  for that is so called because it purifies by means of teaching. <em>Virtue of restraint of faculties</em> is called “purification by restraint”; for that is so called because it purifies by means of the restraint in the mental resolution, “I shall not do so again.” <em>Virtue of livelihood purification</em> is called “purification by search”; for that is so called because search is purified in one who abandons wrong search and gets requisites lawfully and properly. <em>Virtue dependent on requisites</em> is called “purification by reviewing”; for that is so called because it purifies by the reviewing of the kind already described. Hence it was said above (<a class="reference internal" href="#i-125"><span class="std std-ref">§125</span></a>): “There is no offence for one who is mindful in using after accepting without mindfulness.”</p>
<p id="i-127"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-127"><span class="std std-ref">§127</span></a> Use of the requisites by the seven kinds of trainers is called “use as an inheritance”; for they are the Buddha’s sons, therefore they make use of the requisites as the heirs of requisites belonging to their father. But how then, is it the Blessed One’s requisites or the laity’s requisites that are used? Although given by the laity, they actually belong to the Blessed One, because it is by the Blessed One that they are permitted. That is why it should be understood that the Blessed One’s requisites are used. The confirmation here is in the Dhammadāyāda Sutta (MN 3).</p>
<p>Use by those whose cankers are destroyed is called “use as a master”; for they make use of them as masters because they have escaped the slavery of craving.</p>
<p id="i-128"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-128"><span class="std std-ref">§128</span></a> As regards these kinds of use, use as a master and use as an inheritance are allowable for all. Use as a debt is not allowable, to say nothing of use as theft. But this use of what is reviewed by one who is virtuous is use freed from debt because it is the opposite of use as a debt or is included in use as an inheritance too. For one possessed of virtue is called a trainer too because of possessing this training.</p>
<p id="i-129"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-129"><span class="std std-ref">§129</span></a> As regards these three kinds of use, since use as a master is best, when a bhikkhu undertakes <em>virtue dependent on requisites</em>, he should aspire to that and use them after reviewing them in the way described. And this is said:  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">45</span></code></p>

<h3>7.5 18.–19. Pentads</h3>
<p id="i-131"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-131"><span class="std std-ref">§131</span></a> <em>18.</em> In the first pentad in the fivefold section the meaning should be understood in accordance with the virtue of those not fully admitted to the Order, and so on. For this is said in the Paṭisambhidā: “(a) What is virtue consisting in limited purification? That of the training precepts for those not fully admitted to the Order: such is virtue consisting in limited purification. (b) What is virtue consisting in unlimited purification? That of the training precepts for those fully admitted to the Order: such is virtue consisting in unlimited purification. (c) What is virtue consisting in fulfilled purification? That of magnanimous ordinary men devoted to profitable things, who are perfecting [the course] that ends in trainership, regardless of the physical body and life, having given up [attachment to] life: such is virtue of fulfilled purification, (d) What is virtue consisting in purification not adhered to? That of the seven kinds of trainer: such is virtue consisting in purification not adhered to. (e) What is virtue consisting in tranquillized purification? That of the Perfect One’s <em>[44/102]</em> disciples with cankers destroyed, of the Paccekabuddhas, of the Perfect Ones, accomplished and fully enlightened: such is virtue consisting in tranquillized purification” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id105"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 42–43</em> ).</p>
<p id="i-132"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-132"><span class="std std-ref">§132</span></a> (a) Herein, the virtue of those not fully admitted to the Order should be understood as <em>virtue consisting in limited purification</em>, because it is limited by the number [of training precepts, that is, five or eight or ten].</p>
<p>(b) That of those fully admitted to the Order is [describable] thus:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Nine thousand millions, and a hundred</div>
<div class="line">And eighty millions then as well,</div>
<div class="line">And fifty plus a hundred thousand,</div>
<div class="line">And thirty-six again to swell.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The total restraint disciplines:</div>
<div class="line">These rules the Enlightened One explains</div>
<div class="line">Told under heads for filling out,</div>
<div class="line">Which the Discipline restraint contains. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id187" id="id106" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>76<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></div>
</div>
<p>So although limited in number,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">47</span></code>  it should yet be understood as <em>virtue consisting in unlimited purification</em>, since it is undertaken without reserve and has no obvious limit such as gain, fame, relatives, limbs or life. Like the virtue of the Elder Mahā Tissa the Mango-eater who lived at Cīragumba (see <a class="reference internal" href="#i-122"><span class="std std-ref">§122</span></a> above).</p>
<p id="i-133"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-133"><span class="std std-ref">§133</span></a> For that venerable one never abandoned the following good man’s recollection:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“Wealth for a sound limb’s sake should be renounced,</div>
<div class="line">And one who guards his life gives up his limbs;</div>
<div class="line">And wealth and limbs and life, each one of these,</div>
<div class="line">A man gives up who practices the Dhamma.”</div>
</div>
<p>And he never transgressed a training precept even when his life was in the balance, and in this way he reached Arahantship with that same virtue of unlimited purification as his support while he was being carried on a lay devotee’s back. According to as it is said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“Nor your mother nor your father</div>
<div class="line">Nor your relatives and kin</div>
<div class="line">Have done as much as this for you</div>
<div class="line">Because you are possessed of virtue.”</div>
<div class="line">So, stirred with urgency, and wisely</div>
<div class="line">Comprehending <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id188" id="id107" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>77<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  with insight,</div>
<div class="line"><em>[45/103]</em> While carried on his helper’s back</div>
<div class="line">He reached the goal of Arahantship.</div>
</div>
<p id="i-134"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-134"><span class="std std-ref">§134</span></a> (c) The magnanimous ordinary man’s virtue, which from the time of admission to the Order is devoid even of the stain of a [wrong] thought because of its extreme purity, like a gem of purest water, like well-refined gold, becomes the proximate cause for Arahantship itself, which is why it is called <em>consisting of fulfilled purification</em>; like that of the lders Saṅgharakkhita the Great and Saṅgharakkhita the Nephew.</p>
<p id="i-135"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-135"><span class="std std-ref">§135</span></a> The Elder Saṅgharakkhita the Great (<em>Mahā Saṅgharakkhita</em>), aged over sixty, was lying, it seems, on his deathbed. The Order of Bhikkhus questioned him about attainment of the supramundane state. The elder said: “I have no supramundane state.” Then the young bhikkhu who was attending on him said: “Venerable sir, people have come as much as twelve leagues, thinking that you have reached Nibbāna. It will be a disappointment for many if you die as an ordinary man.”—“Friend, thinking to see the Blessed One Metteyya, I did not try for insight.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">48</span></code>  So help me to sit up and give me the chance.” He helped the elder to sit up and went out. As he went out the elder reached Arahantship and he gave a sign by snapping his fingers. The Order assembled and said to him: “Venerable sir, you have done a difficult thing in achieving the supramundane state in the hour of death.”—“That was not difficult, friends. But rather I will tell you what is difficult. Friends, I see no action done [by me] without mindfulness and unknowingly since the time I went forth.” His nephew also reached Arahantship in the same way at the age of fifty years.</p>

<p id="i-138"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-138"><span class="std std-ref">§138</span></a> Also there was a certain senior elder who was very ill and unable to eat with his own hand.

But the bliss obtained by breaking this virtue would be like the lay state obtained by disavowing the training,” and he added: “I shall die together with my virtue.” As he lay there, he comprehended that same illness [with insight], and he reached Arahantship. Having done so, he pronounced these verses to the Order of Bhikkhus:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“I am victim of a sickening disease</div>

<p id="i-140"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-140"><span class="std std-ref">§140</span></a> <em>19.</em> In the second pentad the meaning should be understood as the abandoning, etc., of killing living things, etc.; for this is said in the Paṭisambhidā: “Five kinds of virtue: (1) In the case of killing living things, (a) abandoning is <em>[47/105]</em> virtue, (b) abstention is virtue, (c) volition is virtue, (d) restraint is virtue, (e) non-transgression is virtue.

<p>“Such virtues lead to non-remorse in the mind, to gladdening, to happiness, to tranquillity, to joy, to repetition, to development, to cultivation, to embellishment, to the requisite [for concentration], to the equipment [of concentration], to fulfilment, to complete dispassion, to fading away, to cessation, to peace, to direct-knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id193" id="id112" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>79<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id113"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 46–47</em> )</p>
<p id="i-141"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-141"><span class="std std-ref">§141</span></a> And here there is no state called abandoning other than the mere non-arising of the killing of living things, etc., as stated. But the abandoning of a given [unprofitable state] upholds  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">51</span></code>  a given profitable state in the sense of providing a foundation for it, and concentrates it by preventing wavering, so it is called “virtue” (<em>sīla</em>) in the sense of composing (<em>sīlana</em>), reckoned as upholding and concentrating as stated earlier (<a class="reference internal" href="#i-19"><span class="std std-ref">§19</span></a>).</p>
<p>The other four things mentioned refer to the presence <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id194" id="id114" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>80<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  of occurrence of will as abstention from such and such, as restraint of such and such, as the volition associated with both of these, and as non-transgression in one who does not transgress such and such. But their meaning of virtue has been explained already.</p>
<p>So it is of five kinds as “virtue consisting in abandoning” and so on.</p>
<p id="i-142"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-142"><span class="std std-ref">§142</span></a> At this point the answers to the questions, “What is virtue? In what sense is it virtue?

<h2>8 (vi), (vii) What are the defiling and the cleansing of it?</h2>
<p id="i-143"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-143"><span class="std std-ref">§143</span></a> However, it was also asked (vi) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">What</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">defiling</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">it?</span></code> and (vii) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">What</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">cleansing</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">it?</span></code></p>
<p>We answer that virtue’s tornness, etc., is its defiling, and that its untornness, etc., is its cleansing. Now, that tornness, etc., are comprised under the breach that has gain, fame, etc., as its cause, and under the seven bonds of sexuality. When a man has broken the training course at the beginning or at the end in any instance of the seven classes of offences, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id195" id="id115" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>81<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  his virtue is called torn, like a cloth that is cut at the edge. But when he has broken it in the middle, it is called rent, like a cloth that <em>[49/107]</em> is rent in the middle. When he has broken it twice or thrice in succession, it is called blotched, like a cow whose body is some such colour as black or red with a discrepant colour appearing on the back or the belly. When he has broken it [all over] at intervals, it is called mottled, like a cow speckled [all over] with discrepant-coloured spots at intervals. This in the first place, is how there comes to be tornness with the breach that has gain, etc., as its cause.</p>
<p id="i-144"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-144"><span class="std std-ref">§144</span></a> And likewise with the seven bonds of sexuality; for this is said by the Blessed One: “Here, brahman, some ascetic or brahman claims to lead the life of purity rightly; for he does not  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">52</span></code>  enter into actual sexual intercourse with women. Yet he agrees to massage, manipulation, bathing and rubbing down by women. He enjoys it, desires it and takes satisfaction in it. This is what is torn, rent, blotched and mottled in one who leads the life of purity. This man is said to lead a life of purity that is unclean.

<p>This is how tornness, etc., should be understood as included under the breach that has gain, etc., as its cause and under the seven bonds of sexuality.</p>
<p id="i-151"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-151"><span class="std std-ref">§151</span></a> Untornness, however, is accomplished by the complete non-breaking of the training precepts, by making amends for those broken for which amends should be made, by the absence of the seven bonds of sexuality, and, as well, by the non-arising of such evil things as anger, enmity, contempt, domineering, envy, avarice, deceit, fraud, obduracy, presumption, pride (conceit), haughtiness, conceit (vanity), and negligence (MN 7), and by the arising of such qualities as fewness of wishes, contentment, and effacement (MN 24).</p>
<p id="i-152"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-152"><span class="std std-ref">§152</span></a> <em>[50/108]</em> Virtues not broken for the purpose of gain, etc., and rectified by making amends after being broken by the faults of negligence, etc., and not damaged by the bonds of sexuality and by such evil things as anger and enmity, are called entirely untorn, unrent, unblotched, and unmottled. And those same virtues are <em>liberating</em> since they bring about the state of a freeman, and praised by the wise since it is by the wise that they are praised, and <em>unadhered-to</em> since they are not adhered to by means of craving and views, and <em>conducive to concentration</em> since they conduce to access concentration or to absorption concentration. That is why their untornness, etc., should be understood as “cleansing” (see also <a class="reference internal" href="ch-07.xhtml#vii-101"><span class="std std-ref">VII.101f.</span></a>).</p>
<p id="i-153"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-153"><span class="std std-ref">§153</span></a> This cleansing comes about in two ways: through seeing the danger of failure in virtue, and through seeing the benefit of perfected virtue.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">54</span></code>  Herein, the danger of failure in virtue can be seen in accordance with such suttas as that beginning, “Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers for the unvirtuous in the failure of virtue” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id117"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>III 252</em> ).</p>
<p id="i-154"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-154"><span class="std std-ref">§154</span></a> Furthermore, on account of his unvirtuousness an unvirtuous person is displeasing to deities and human beings, is uninstructable by his fellows in the life of purity, suffers when unvirtuousness is censured, and is remorseful when the virtuous are praised. Owing to that unvirtuousness he is as ugly as hemp cloth. Contact with him is painful because those who fall in with his views are brought to long-lasting suffering in the states of loss. He is worthless because he causes no great fruit [to accrue] to those who give him gifts. He is as hard to purify as a cesspit many years old. He is like a log from a pyre (see It 99); for he is outside both [recluseship and the lay state]. Though claiming the bhikkhu state he is no bhikkhu, so he is like a donkey following a herd of cattle. He is always nervous, like a man who is everyone’s enemy. He is as unfit to live with as a dead carcase. Though he may have the qualities of learning, etc., he is as unfit for the homage of his fellows in the life of purity as a charnel-ground fire is for that of brahmans. He is as incapable of reaching the distinction of attainment as a blind man is of seeing a visible object. He is as careless of the Good Law as a guttersnipe is of a kingdom. Though he fancies he is happy, yet he suffers because he reaps suffering as told in the Discourse on the Mass of Fire ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id118"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>IV 128–134</em> ).</p>
<p id="i-155"><a class="reference internal" href="#i-155"><span class="std std-ref">§155</span></a> Now, the Blessed One has shown that when the unvirtuous have their minds captured by pleasure and satisfaction in the indulgence of the five cords of sense desires, in [receiving] salutation, in being honoured, etc., the result of that kamma, directly visible in all ways, is very violent pain, with that [kamma] as its condition, capable of producing a gush of hot blood by causing agony of heart with the mere recollection of it. Here is the text:</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, do you see that great mass of fire burning, blazing and glowing?—Yes, venerable sir.—What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that one [gone forth] should sit down or lie down embracing that mass of fire burning, blazing and glowing, or that he should sit down or lie down embracing a warrior-noble maiden or a brahman maiden or a maiden of householder family, with soft, delicate hands and feet?—It would be better, venerable sir, that he should sit down or lie down embracing a warrior-noble maiden …  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">55</span></code>  It would be painful, venerable sir, <em>[51/109]</em> if he sat down or lay down embracing that great mass of fire burning, blazing and glowing.</p>

Why is that? By his doing so, bhikkhus, he might come to death or deadly suffering, yet he would not on that account, on the breakup of the body, after death, reappear in states of loss, in an unhappy destiny, in perdition, in hell. But if one who is unvirtuous, evil-natured … and full of corruption, should sit down or lie down embracing a warrior-noble maiden … that would be long for his harm and suffering: on the break-up of the body, after death, he would reappear in states of loss, in an unhappy destiny, in perdition, in hell” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id119"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>IV 128–129</em> ).</p>

<p><em>Uposatha</em> (der. from <em>upavasati</em>, to observe or to prepare) is the name for the day of “fasting” or “vigil” observed on the days of the new moon, waxing half moon, full moon, and waning half moon. On these days it is customary for laymen to undertake the Eight Precepts (<em>sīla</em>) or Five Precepts. On the new-moon and full-moon days the Pātimokkha (see note 11) is recited by bhikkhus. The two quarter-moon days are called the “eighth of the half moon.” The Full-moon day is called the “fifteenth” (i.e. fifteen days from the new moon) and is the last day of the lunar month. That of the new moon is called the “fourteenth” when it is the second and fourth new moon of the four-month season (i.e. fourteen days from the full moon), the other two are called the “fifteenth.” This compensates for the irregularities of the lunar period.</p>

<p>The Suttavibhaṅga, the first book of the Vinaya Piṭaka, contains in its two parts the 227 rules for bhikkhus and the rules for bhikkhunīs, who have received the admission (<em>upasampadā</em>), together with accounts of the incidents that led to the announcement of the rules, the modification of the rules and the explanations of them. The bare rules themselves form the Pātimokkha for bhikkhus and that for bhikkhunīs. They are also known as the “two codes” (<em>dve mātikā</em>). The Pātimokkha is recited by bhikkhus on the Uposatha days of the full moon and new moon.</p>

<p>“‘<em>On seeing a visible object with the eye</em>”: if the eye were to see the visible object, then (organs) belonging to other kinds of consciousness would see too; but that is not so. Why? Because the eye has no thought (<em>acetanattā</em>). And then, were consciousness itself to see a visible object, it would see it even behind a wall because of being independent of sense resistance (<em>appaṭighabhāvato</em>); but that is not so either because there is no seeing in all kinds of consciousness. And herein, it is consciousness dependent on the eye that sees, not just any kind. And that does not arise with respect to what is enclosed by walls, etc., where light is excluded. But where there is no exclusion of light, as in the case of a crystal or a mass of cloud, there it does arise even with respect to what is enclosed by them. So it is as a basis of consciousness that the eye sees.</p>
<p>“‘<em>When there is the impingement of door and object</em>’: what is intended is: when a visible datum as object has come into the eye’s focus. ‘<em>One sees</em>’: one looks (<em>oloketi</em>); for when the consciousness that has eye-sensitivity as its material support is disclosing (<em>obhāsente</em>) by means of the special quality of its support a visible datum as object that is assisted by light (<em>āloka</em>), then it is said that a person possessed of that sees the visible datum. And here the illuminating is the revealing of the visible datum according to its individual essence, in other words, the apprehending of it experientially (<em>paccakkhato</em>).</p>
<p>“Here it is the ‘<em>sign of woman</em>’ because it is the cause of perceiving as ‘woman’ all such things as the shape that is grasped under the heading of the visible data (materiality) invariably found in a female continuity, the un-clear-cut-ness (<em>avisadatā</em>) of the flesh of the breasts, the beardlessness of the face, the use of cloth to bind the hair, the un-clear-cut stance, walk, and so on. The ‘<em>sign of man</em>’ is in the opposite sense.</p>
<p>“‘<em>The sign of beauty</em>’ here is the aspect of woman that is the cause for the arising of lust. By the word ‘etc.’ the sign of resentment (<em>paṭigha</em>), etc., are included, which should be understood as the undesired aspect that is the cause for the arising of hate. And here admittedly only covetousness and grief are specified in the text but the sign of equanimity needs to be included too; since there is non-restraint in the delusion that arises due to overlooking, or since ‘forgetfulness of unknowing’ is said below (§57). And here the ‘sign of equanimity’ should be understood as an object that is the basis for the kind of equanimity associated with unknowing through overlooking it. So ‘<em>the sign of beauty</em>, etc.’ given in brief thus is actually the cause of greed, hate, and delusion. “‘<em>He stops at what is merely seen</em>’: according to the Sutta method, ‘The seen shall be merely seen’ ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#ud" id="id148"><span>[Ud]</span></a> <em>8</em> ). As soon as the colour basis has been apprehended by the consciousnesses of the cognitive series with eye-consciousness he stops; he does not fancy any aspect of beauty, etc., beyond that…. In one who fancies as beautiful, etc., the limbs of the opposite sex, defilements arisen with respect to them successively become particularized, which is why they are called ‘particulars.’ But these are simply modes of interpreting (<em>sannivesākāra</em>) the kinds of materiality derived from the (four) primaries that are interpreted (<em>sanniviṭṭha</em>) in such and such wise; for apart from that there is in the ultimate sense no such thing as a hand and so on” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vism-mht" id="id149"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>40–41</em> ).

<p>“As the elder was going along (occupied) only in keeping his meditation subject in mind, since noise is a thorn to those in the early stage, he looked up with the noise of the laughter, (wondering) ‘What is that?’ ‘Perception of foulness’ is perception of bones; for the elder was then making bones his meditation subject. The elder, it seems as soon as he saw her teeth-bones while she was laughing, got the counterpart sign with access jhāna because he had developed the preliminary-work well. While he stood there he reached the first jhāna.

<p>To expect to find in the <em>Paramatthamañjūsā</em> an exposition of the “cognitive series” (<em>citta-vīthi</em>), and some explanation of the individual members in addition to what is to be found in the <em>Visuddhimagga</em> itself, is to be disappointed.

<p>“There is no unvirtuousness, in other words, bodily or verbal misconduct, in the five doors; consequently restraint of unvirtuousness happens through the mind door, and the remaining restraint happens through the six doors. For the arising of forgetfulness and the other three would be in the five doors since they are unprofitable states opposed to mindfulness, etc.; and there is no arising of unvirtuousness consisting in bodily and verbal transgression there because five-door impulsions do not give rise to intimation. And the five kinds of non-restraint beginning with unvirtuousness are stated here as the opposite of the five kinds of restraint beginning with restraint as virtue” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vism-mht" id="id153"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>42</em> ).
