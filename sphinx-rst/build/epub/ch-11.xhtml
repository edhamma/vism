<h2>1 Perception of Repulsiveness in Nutriment</h2>
<p id="xi-1"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-1"><span class="std std-ref">§1</span></a> <em>[337/395]</em>  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">341</span></code>  Now comes the description of the development of the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, which was listed as the “one perception” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id72" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>47<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  next to the immaterial states (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-03.xhtml#iii-105"><span class="std std-ref">III.105</span></a>).</p>
<p>Herein, it nourishes (<em>āharati</em>, lit. “brings on”), thus it is nutriment (<em>āhāra</em>, lit. “bringing on”). That is of four kinds as: physical nutriment, nutriment consisting of contact, nutriment consisting of mental volition, and nutriment consisting of consciousness. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id74" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>48<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="xi-2"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-2"><span class="std std-ref">§2</span></a> <em>[338/396]</em> But what is it here that nourishes (brings on) what? Physical nutriment (<em>kabaliṅkārāhāra</em>) nourishes (brings on) the materiality of the octad that has nutritive essence as eighth: <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id77" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>49<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  contact as nutriment nourishes (brings on) the three kinds of feeling; mental volition as nutriment nourishes (brings on) rebirth-linking in the three kinds of becoming; consciousness as nutriment nourishes (brings on) mentality-materiality at the moment of rebirth-linking.</p>
<p id="xi-3"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-3"><span class="std std-ref">§3</span></a> Now, when there is physical nutriment there is attachment, which brings peril; when there is nutriment as contact there is approaching, which brings peril; when there is nutriment as mental volition there is rebirth-linking, which brings peril. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id78" id="id4" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>50<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  And to show how they bring fear thus, physical nutriment should be illustrated by the simile of the child’s flesh ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id5"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>II 98</em> ), contact as nutriment by the simile of the hideless cow ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id6"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>II 99</em> ), mental volition as nutriment by the simile of the pit of live coals ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id7"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>II 99</em> ), and consciousness as nutriment by the simile of the hundred spears ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id8"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>II 100</em> ).</p>
<p id="xi-4"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-4"><span class="std std-ref">§4</span></a> But of these four kinds of nutriment it is only physical nutriment, classed as what is eaten, drunk, chewed, and tasted, that is intended here as “nutriment” in this sense. The perception arisen as the apprehension of the repulsive aspect in that nutriment is, “perception of repulsiveness in nutriment.”</p>
<p id="xi-5"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-5"><span class="std std-ref">§5</span></a> <em>[339/397]</em> One who wants to develop that perception of repulsiveness in nutriment should learn the meditation subject and see that he has no uncertainty about even a single word of what he has learnt. Then he should go into solitary retreat and  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">342</span></code>  review repulsiveness in ten aspects in the physical nutriment classified as what is eaten, drunk, chewed, and tasted, that is to say, as to going, seeking, using, secretion, receptacle, what is uncooked (undigested), what is cooked (digested), fruit, outflow, and smearing.</p>
<p id="xi-6"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-6"><span class="std std-ref">§6</span></a> <em>1.</em> Herein, <em>as to going</em>: even when a man has gone forth in so mighty a dispensation, still after he has perhaps spent all night reciting the Enlightened One’s word or doing the ascetic’ s work, after he has risen early to do the duties connected with the shrine terrace and the Enlightenment-tree terrace, to set out the water for drinking and washing, to sweep the grounds and to see to the needs of the body, after he has sat down on his seat and given attention to his meditation subject twenty or thirty times <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id86" id="id9" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>51<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  and got up again, then he must take his bowl and [outer] robe, he must leave behind the ascetics’ woods that are not crowded with people, offer the bliss of seclusion, possess shade and water, and are clean, cool, delightful places, he must disregard the Noble Ones’ delight in seclusion, and he must set out for the village in order to get nutriment, as a jackal for the charnel ground.</p>
<p id="xi-7"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-7"><span class="std std-ref">§7</span></a> And as he goes thus, from the time when he steps down from his bed or chair he has to tread on a carpet <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id89" id="id10" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>52<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  covered with the dust of his feet, geckos’ droppings, and so on. Next he has to see the doorstep, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id91" id="id11" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>53<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  which is more repulsive than the inside of the room since it is often fouled with the droppings of rats, bats, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id92" id="id12" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>54<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  and so on. Next the lower terrace, which is more repulsive than the terrace above since it is all smeared with the droppings of owls, pigeons, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id94" id="id13" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>55<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  and so on. Next the grounds, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id95" id="id14" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>56<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  which are more repulsive than the lower floor since they are defiled by old grass and leaves blown about by the wind, by sick novices’ urine, excrement, spittle and snot, and in the rainy season by water, mud, and so on. And he has to see the road to the monastery, which is more repulsive than the grounds.</p>
<p id="xi-8"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-8"><span class="std std-ref">§8</span></a> <em>[340/398]</em> In due course, after standing in the debating lodge <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id96" id="id15" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>57<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  when he has finished paying homage at the Enlightenment Tree and the shrine, he sets out thinking, “Instead of looking at the shrine that is like a cluster of pearls, and the Enlightenment Tree that is as lovely as a bouquet of peacock’s tail feathers, and the abode that is as fair as a god’s palace, I must now turn my back on such a charming place and go abroad for the sake of food;” and on the way to the village, the view of a road of stumps and thorns and an uneven road broken up by the force of water awaits him.</p>
<p id="xi-9"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-9"><span class="std std-ref">§9</span></a> Next, after he has put on his waist cloth as one who hides an abscess, and tied his waist band as one who ties a bandage on a wound, and robed himself in his upper robes as one who hides a skeleton, and taken out his bowl as one who takes out a pan for medicine,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">343</span></code>  when he reaches the vicinity of the village gate, perhaps the sight of an elephant’s carcass, a horse’s carcass, a buffalo’s carcass, a human carcass, a snake’s carcass, or a dog’s carcass awaits him, and not only that, but he has to suffer his nose to be assailed by the smell of them.</p>
<p>Next, as he stands in the village gateway, he must scan the village streets in order to avoid danger from savage elephants, horses, and so on.</p>
<p id="xi-10"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-10"><span class="std std-ref">§10</span></a> So this repulsive [experience] beginning with the carpet that has to be trodden on and ending with the various kinds of carcasses that have to be seen and smelled, [has to be undergone] for the sake of nutriment: “Oh, nutriment is indeed a repulsive thing!”</p>
<p>This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to going.</p>
<p id="xi-11"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-11"><span class="std std-ref">§11</span></a> <em>2.</em> How <em>as to seeking</em>? When he has endured the repulsiveness of going in this way, and has gone into the village, and is clothed in his cloak of patches, he has to wander in the village streets from house to house like a beggar with a dish in his hand. And in the rainy season wherever he treads his feet sink into water and mire up to the flesh of the calves. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id98" id="id16" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>58<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  He has to hold the bowl in one hand and his robe up with the other. In the hot season he has to go about with his body covered with the dirt, grass, and dust blown about by the wind. On reaching such and such a house door he has to see and even to tread in gutters and cesspools covered with blue-bottles and seething with all the species of worms, all mixed up with fish washings, meat washings, rice washings, spittle, snot, dogs’ and pigs’ excrement, and what not, from which flies come up and settle on his outer cloak of patches and on his bowl and on his head.</p>
<p id="xi-12"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-12"><span class="std std-ref">§12</span></a> And when he enters a house, some give and some do not. And when they give, some give yesterday’s cooked rice and stale cakes and rancid jelly, sauce and so on. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id101" id="id17" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>59<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  Some, not giving, say, “Please pass on, venerable sir,” others keep <em>[341/399]</em> silent as if they did not see him. Some avert their faces. Others treat him with harsh words such as: “Go away, you bald-head.” When he has wandered for alms in the village in this way like a beggar, he has to depart from it.</p>
<p id="xi-13"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-13"><span class="std std-ref">§13</span></a> So this [experience] beginning with the entry into the village and ending with the departure from it, which is repulsive owing to the water, mud, etc., that has to be trodden in and seen and endured, [has to be undergone] for the sake of nutriment: “Oh, nutriment is indeed a repulsive thing!”</p>
<p>This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to seeking.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">344</span></code></p>
<p id="xi-14"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-14"><span class="std std-ref">§14</span></a> <em>3.</em> How <em>as to using</em>? After he has sought the nutriment in this way and is sitting at ease in a comfortable place outside the village, then so long as he has not dipped his hand into it he would be able to invite a respected bhikkhu or a decent person, if he saw one, [to share it]; but as soon as he has dipped his hand into it out of desire to eat he would be ashamed to say, “Take some.” And when he has dipped his hand in and is squeezing it up, the sweat trickling down his five fingers wets any dry crisp food there may be and makes it sodden.</p>
<p id="xi-15"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-15"><span class="std std-ref">§15</span></a> And when its good appearance has been spoilt by his squeezing it up, and it has been made into a ball and put into his mouth, then the lower teeth function as a mortar, the upper teeth as a pestle, and the tongue as a hand. It gets pounded there with the pestle of the teeth like a dog’s dinner in a dog’s trough, while he turns it over and over with his tongue; then the thin spittle at the tip of the tongue smears it, and the thick spittle behind the middle of the tongue smears it, and the filth from the teeth in the parts where a tooth-stick cannot reach smears it.</p>
<p id="xi-16"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-16"><span class="std std-ref">§16</span></a> When thus mashed up and besmeared, this peculiar compound now destitute of the [original] colour and smell is reduced to a condition as utterly nauseating as a dog’s vomit in a dog’s trough. Yet, notwithstanding that it is like this, it can still be swallowed because it is no longer in range of the eye’s focus.</p>
<p>This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to using.</p>
<p id="xi-17"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-17"><span class="std std-ref">§17</span></a> <em>4.</em> How <em>as to secretion</em>? Buddhas and Paccekabuddhas and Wheel-turning Monarchs have only one of the four secretions consisting of bile, phlegm, pus and blood, but those with weak merit have all four. So when [the food] has arrived at the stage of being eaten and it enters inside, then in one whose secretion of bile is in excess it becomes as utterly nauseating as if smeared with thick <em>madhuka</em> oil; in one whose secretion of phlegm in excess it is as if smeared with the juice of <em>nāgabalā</em> leaves; <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id102" id="id18" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>60<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  in one whose secretion of pus is in excess it is as if smeared with rancid buttermilk; and in one whose secretion of blood is in excess it is as utterly nauseating as if smeared with dye. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to secretion.</p>
<p id="xi-18"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-18"><span class="std std-ref">§18</span></a> <em>5.</em> How <em>as to receptacle</em>? When it has gone inside the belly and is smeared with one of these secretions, then the receptacle it goes into is no gold dish or crystal or silver dish and so on. On the contrary, if it is swallowed by one ten years old, it finds itself in a place like a cesspit unwashed for ten years.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">345</span></code>  If it is swallowed by one twenty years old, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety <em>[342/400]</em> years old, if it is swallowed by one a hundred years old, it finds itself in a place like a cesspit unwashed for a hundred years. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to receptacle.</p>
<p id="xi-19"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-19"><span class="std std-ref">§19</span></a> <em>6.</em> How <em>as to what is uncooked</em> (<em>undigested</em>)? After this nutriment has arrived at such a place for its receptacle, then for as long as it remains uncooked it stays in that same place just described, which is shrouded in absolute darkness, pervaded by draughts, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id103" id="id19" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>61<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  tainted by various smells of ordure and utterly fetid and loathsome. And just as when a cloud out of season has rained during a drought and bits of grass and leaves and rushes and the carcasses of snakes, dogs and human beings that have collected in a pit at the gate of an outcaste village remain there warmed by the sun’s heat until the pit becomes covered with froth and bubbles, so too, what has been swallowed that day and yesterday and the day before remains there together, and being smothered by the layer of phlegm and covered with froth and bubbles produced by digestion through being fermented by the heat of the bodily fires, it becomes quite loathsome. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to what is uncooked.</p>
<p id="xi-20"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-20"><span class="std std-ref">§20</span></a> <em>7.</em> How <em>as to what is cooked</em>? When it has been completely cooked there by the bodily fires, it does not turn into gold, silver, etc., as the ores <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id104" id="id20" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>62<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  of gold, silver, etc., do [through smelting]. Instead, giving off froth and bubbles, it turns into excrement and fills the receptacle for digested food, like brown clay squeezed with a smoothing trowel and packed into a tube, and it turns into urine and fills the bladder. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to what is cooked.</p>
<p id="xi-21"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-21"><span class="std std-ref">§21</span></a> <em>8.</em> How <em>as to fruit</em>? When it has been rightly cooked, it produces the various kinds of ordure consisting of head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, and the rest. When wrongly cooked it produces the hundred diseases beginning with itch, ring-worm, smallpox, leprosy, plague, consumption, coughs, flux, and so on. Such is its fruit. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to fruit.</p>
<p id="xi-22"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-22"><span class="std std-ref">§22</span></a> 9. How <em>as to outflow</em>? On being swallowed, it enters by one door, after which it flows out by several doors in the way beginning, “Eye-dirt from the eye, ear-dirt from the ear” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#sn" id="id21"><span>[Sn]</span></a> <em>197</em> ). And on being swallowed it is swallowed even in the company of large gatherings. But on flowing out, now converted into excrement, urine, etc., it is excreted only in solitude.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">346</span></code>  On the first day one is delighted to eat it, elated and full of happiness and joy. On the second day one stops one’s nose to void it, with a wry face, disgusted and dismayed. And on the first day one swallows it lustfully, greedily, gluttonously, infatuatedly. But on the second day, after a single night has passed, one excretes it with distaste, ashamed, humiliated and disgusted. Hence the Ancients said:</p>
<p id="xi-23"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-23"><span class="std std-ref">§23</span></a></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The food and drink so greatly prized—</div>
<div class="line">The crisp to chew, the soft to suck—</div>
<div class="line">Go in all by a single door,</div>
<div class="line">But by nine doors come oozing out.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>[343/401]</em> The food and drink so greatly prized—</div>
<div class="line">The crisp to chew, the soft to suck—</div>
<div class="line">Men like to eat in company,</div>
<div class="line">But to excrete in secrecy.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The food and drink so greatly prized—</div>
<div class="line">The crisp to chew, the soft to suck—</div>
<div class="line">These a man eats with high delight,</div>
<div class="line">And then excretes with dumb disgust.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The food and drink so greatly prized—</div>
<div class="line">The crisp to chew, the soft to suck—</div>
<div class="line">A single night will be enough</div>
<div class="line">To bring them to putridity.</div>
</div>
<p>This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to outflow.</p>
<p id="xi-24"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-24"><span class="std std-ref">§24</span></a> <em>10.</em> How <em>as to smearing</em>? At the time of using it he smears his hands, lips, tongue and palate, and they become repulsive by being smeared with it. And even when washed, they have to be washed again and again in order to remove the smell. And, just as, when rice is being boiled, the husks, the red powder covering the grain, etc., rise up and smear the mouth, rim and lid of the cauldron, so too, when eaten it rises up during its cooking and simmering by the bodily fire that pervades the whole body, it turns into tartar, which smears the teeth, and it turns into spittle, phlegm, etc., which respectively smear the tongue, palate, etc.; and it turns into eye-dirt, ear-dirt, snot, urine, excrement, etc., which respectively smear the eyes, ears, nose and nether passages. And when these doors are smeared by it, they never become either clean or pleasing even though washed every day. And after one has washed a certain one of these, the hand has to be washed again. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id105" id="id22" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>63<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  And after one has washed a certain one of these, the repulsiveness does not depart from it even after two or three washings with cow dung and clay and scented powder. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to smearing.</p>
<p id="xi-25"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-25"><span class="std std-ref">§25</span></a> As he reviews repulsiveness in this way in ten aspects and strikes at it with thought and applied thought, physical nutriment  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">347</span></code>  becomes evident to him in its repulsive aspect. He cultivates that sign <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id107" id="id23" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>64<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  again and again, develops and <em>[344/402]</em> repeatedly practices it. As he does so, the hindrances are suppressed, and his mind is concentrated in access concentration, but without reaching absorption because of the profundity of physical nutriment as a state with an individual essence. But perception is evident here in the apprehension of the repulsive aspect, which is why this meditation subject goes by the name of “perception of repulsiveness in nutriment.”</p>
<p id="xi-26"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-26"><span class="std std-ref">§26</span></a> When a bhikkhu devotes himself to this perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, his mind retreats, retracts and recoils from craving for flavours. He nourishes himself with nutriment without vanity and only for the purpose of crossing over suffering, as one who seeks to cross over the desert eats his own dead child’s flesh ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id24"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>II 98</em> ). Then his greed for the five cords of sense desire comes to be fully understood without difficulty by means of the full understanding of the physical nutriment. He fully understands the materiality aggregate by means of the full-understanding of the five cords of sense desire. Development of mindfulness occupied with the body comes to perfection in him through the repulsiveness of “what is uncooked” and the rest. He has entered upon a way that is in conformity with the perception of foulness. And by keeping to this way, even if he does not experience the deathless goal in this life, he is at least bound for a happy destiny.</p>
<p>This is the detailed explanation of the development of the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment.</p>

<h2>2 Defining of The Elements</h2>
<section id="word-definitions">
<h3>2.1 Word Definitions</h3>
<p id="xi-27"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-27"><span class="std std-ref">§27</span></a> Now comes the description of the development of the definition of the four elements, which was listed as the “one defining” next to the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-03.xhtml#iii-105"><span class="std std-ref">III.105</span></a>).</p>
<p>Herein, “defining” (<em>vavatthāna</em>) is determining by characterizing individual essences. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id109" id="id25" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>65<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  [The compound] <em>catudhātuvavatthāna</em> (“four-element defining”) is [resolvable into] <em>catunnaṃ dhātūnaṃ vavatthānaṃ</em> (“defining of the four elements”). “Attention given to elements,” “the meditation subject consisting of elements” and “defining of the four elements” all mean the same thing.</p>
<p>This is given in two ways: in brief and in detail. It is given in brief in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#d" id="id26"><span>[D]</span></a> <em>II 294</em> ), and in detail in the Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id27"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 185</em> ), the Rāhulovāda Sutta ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id28"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 421</em> ), and the Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id29"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>III 240</em> ).</p>

<h3>2.2 Texts and Commentary in Brief</h3>
<p id="xi-28"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-28"><span class="std std-ref">§28</span></a> <em>[345/403]</em> It is given in brief in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta, for one of quick understanding whose meditation subject is elements, as follows: “Bhikkhus, just as though a skilled butcher or butcher’s apprentice had killed a cow and were seated at the crossroads  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">348</span></code>  with it cut up into pieces, so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this body however placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements: In this body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element”  <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id110" id="id30" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>66<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#d" id="id31"><span>[D]</span></a> <em>II 294</em> ).</p>
<p id="xi-29"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-29"><span class="std std-ref">§29</span></a> The meaning is this: <em>just as though a clever butcher</em>, or his <em>apprentice</em> who worked for his keep, <em>had killed a cow</em> and divided it up <em>and were seated at the crossroads</em>, reckoned as the intersection of the main roads going in the four directions, having laid it out part by part, <em>so too a bhikkhu reviews the body, however placed</em> because it is in some one of the four postures and <em>however disposed</em> because it is so placed, thus: <em>In this body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element</em>.</p>
<p id="xi-30"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-30"><span class="std std-ref">§30</span></a> What is meant? Just as the butcher, while feeding the cow, bringing it to the shambles, keeping it tied up after bringing it there, slaughtering it, and seeing it slaughtered and dead, does not lose the perception “cow” so long as he has not carved it up and divided it into parts; but when he has divided it up and is sitting there, he loses the perception “cow” and the perception “meat” occurs; he does not think “I am selling cow” or “They are carrying cow away,” but rather he thinks “I am selling meat” or “They are carrying meat away”; so too this bhikkhu, while still a foolish ordinary person—both formerly as a layman and as one gone forth into homelessness—does not lose the perception “living being” or “man” or “person” so long as he does not, by resolution of the compact into elements, review this body, however placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements. But when he does review it as consisting of elements, he loses the perception “living being” and his mind establishes itself upon elements. That is why the Blessed One said: “Bhikkhus, just as though a skilled butcher … were seated at the crossroads … so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu … air element.”</p>

<h3>2.3 In Detail</h3>
<p id="xi-31"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-31"><span class="std std-ref">§31</span></a> <em>[346/404]</em> In the Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta it is given in detail for one of not over-quick understanding whose meditation subject is elements—and as here so also in the Rāhulovāda and Dhātuvibhaṅga Suttas—as follows:</p>
<p>“And what is the internal earth element, friends? Whatever there is internally in oneself that is hard, harsh, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id112" id="id32" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>67<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  and clung to (acquired through kamma), that is to say, head hairs, body hairs, teeth, nails, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidney, heart, liver, midriff, spleen, lungs, bowels, entrails, gorge, dung, or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is hard, harsh, and clung to—this is called the internal earth element” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id33"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 185</em> ).  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">349</span></code></p>
<p>And: “What is the internal water element, friends? Whatever there is internally in oneself that is water, watery, and clung to, that is to say, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of the joints, and urine, or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is water, watery, and clung to—this is called the internal water element” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id34"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 187</em> ).</p>
<p>And: “What is the internal fire element, friends? Whatever there is internally in oneself that is fire, fiery, and clung to, that is to say, that whereby one is warmed, ages, and burns up, and whereby what is eaten, drunk, chewed and tasted gets completely digested, or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is fire, fiery, and clung to—this is called the internal fire element” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id35"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 188</em> ).</p>
<p>And: “What is the internal air element, friends? Whatever there is internally in oneself that is air, airy, and clung to, that is to say, up-going winds, down-going winds, winds in the belly, winds in the bowels, winds that course through all the limbs, in-breath and out-breath, or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is air, airy, and clung to—this is called the internal air element” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id36"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 188</em> ).</p>
<p id="xi-32"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-32"><span class="std std-ref">§32</span></a> Here is the commentary on the words that are not clear. <em>Internally in oneself</em> (<em>ajjhattaṃ paccattaṃ</em>): both these words are terms for what is one’s own (<em>niyaka</em>), since what is one’s own is what is produced in one’s own self (<em>attani jātaṃ</em>); the meaning is, included in one’s continuity (<em>sasantati-pariyāpanna</em>). This is called “internal” (<em>ajjhanaṃ = adhi + attā</em>, lit. “belonging-to-self”) because it occurs in self (<em>attani—</em>locative case) just as in the world, speech among women (<em>itthīsu—</em>loc. case) is called “[speech] belonging-to-women” (<em>adhitthi</em>). And it is called, “in oneself” (<em>paccattaṃ</em>) because it occurs owing to self (<em>attānaṃ paṭicca</em>). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id113" id="id37" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>68<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="xi-33"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-33"><span class="std std-ref">§33</span></a> <em>Hard</em>: rigid. <em>Harsh</em>: rough. Herein, the first is a word for the characteristic, while the second is a word for the mode; for the earth element is characterized as hard, but its mode is rough, which is why it is called “harsh.” <em>Clung to</em>: taken firmly [by kamma]; the meaning is, firmly taken, seized, adhered to, as “I,” “mine” (see <a class="reference internal" href="#xi-89"><span class="std std-ref">§89f.</span></a>).</p>
<p id="xi-34"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-34"><span class="std std-ref">§34</span></a> <em>That is to say</em>: the word <em>seyyathidaṃ</em> (“that is to say”) is a particle; its meaning is, “What is that?” Next, showing what that is, “head hairs, body hairs,” etc., is <em>[347/405]</em> said. And here the <em>brain</em> must be added since it has to be understood that the earth element needs to be described in twenty modes. Or <em>whatever else</em>: the earth element included in the remaining three portions.</p>
<p id="xi-35"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-35"><span class="std std-ref">§35</span></a>  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">350</span></code>  It flows (<em>appoti</em>), flows on (<em>pappoti</em>), to such and such a place as a state of streaming, thus it is water (<em>āpo</em>). The <em>watery</em> (<em>āpo-gata</em>) is what is gone (<em>gata</em>) among such various kinds of water (<em>āpo</em>) as the kamma-originated, and so on. What is that? It is what has the water element’s characteristic of cohesion.</p>
<p id="xi-36"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-36"><span class="std std-ref">§36</span></a> <em>Fire</em> (<em>tejo</em>) [is definable] as heating (<em>tejana</em>). The <em>fiery</em> (<em>tejo-gata</em>) is what is gone (<em>gata</em>), in the way already described, among the kinds of fire (<em>tejo</em>). What is that? It is what has the characteristic of heat. <em>Whereby</em>: by means of which the fire element, when excited, this body is <em>warmed</em>, becomes heated by the state of one-day fever, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id115" id="id38" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>69<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  and so on. <em>Ages</em>: whereby this body grows old, reaches the decline of the faculties, loss of strength, wrinkles, grayness, and so on. <em>Burns up</em>: whereby, when excited, it causes this body to burn, and the person cries out, “I am burning, I am burning!” and longs for ghee a hundred times washed and for <em>gosīsa</em> sandalwood ointment, etc., and for the breeze of a fan. <em>And whereby what is eaten, drunk, chewed and tasted gets completely digested</em>: whereby the boiled rice, etc., that is eaten, or the beverage, etc., that is drunk, or the hard food consisting of flour biscuits, etc., that is chewed, the mango fruit, honey, molasses, etc., that is tasted, gets completely cooked; gets its juice, etc., extracted, is the meaning. And here the first three kinds of fire element [that is to say, “is warmed,” “ages,” and “burns up”] are of fourfold origination (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-20.xhtml#xx-27"><span class="std std-ref">XX.27ff.</span></a>), while the last is only kamma-originated.</p>
<p id="xi-37"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-37"><span class="std std-ref">§37</span></a> <em>Air</em> (<em>vāyo</em>) [is definable] as blowing (<em>vāyana</em>). The <em>airy</em> (<em>vāyo-gata</em>) is what is gone (<em>gata</em>), in the way already described, among the kinds of air. What is that? It is what has the characteristic of distension. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id118" id="id39" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>70<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  <em>Upgoing winds</em>: winds (forces) mounting upwards that cause the occurrence of vomiting, belching, and so on. <em>Down-going winds</em>: winds (forces) descending downwards that expel excrement and urine. <em>Winds in the belly</em>: winds (forces) outside the bowels. <em>Winds in the bowels</em>: winds (forces) inside the bowels. <em>Winds that course through all the limbs</em>: winds (forces) that produce flexing, extending, etc., and are distributed over the limbs and the whole body by means of the network of veins (nerves). <em>In-breath</em>: wind in the nostrils entering in. <em>Out-breath</em>: wind in the nostrils issuing out. And here the first five are of fourfold origination. In-breath and out-breath are consciousness-originated.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">351</span></code>  <em>[348/406]</em> In each instance the phrase <em>or whatever else</em> comprises respectively the water element, the fire element, or the air element included in the other three portions.</p>
<p id="xi-38"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-38"><span class="std std-ref">§38</span></a> So the four elements have been detailed in forty-two aspects, that is to say, the earth element in twenty aspects, the water element in twelve, the fire element in four, and the air element in six.</p>
<p>This, firstly, is the commentary on the texts here.</p>
</section>
<section id="method-of-development-in-brief">
<h3>2.4 Method of Development in Brief</h3>
<p id="xi-39"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-39"><span class="std std-ref">§39</span></a> As regards the method of development here, however, to discern the elements in detail in this way, “The head hairs are the earth element, the body hairs are the earth element,” appears redundant to a bhikkhu of quick understanding, though the meditation subject becomes clear to him if he gives his attention to it in this way: “What has the characteristic of stiffenedness is the earth element, what has the characteristic of cohesion is the water element, what has the characteristic of ripening (maturing) is the fire element, what has the characteristic of distending (supporting) is the air element.” But when one of not over-quick understanding gives his attention to it in this way, it appears obscure and unevident, and it only becomes plain to him if he gives his attention to it in the first-mentioned way. Why?</p>
<p id="xi-40"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-40"><span class="std std-ref">§40</span></a> Suppose two bhikkhus are reciting a text with many elided repetitions, then the bhikkhu with the quicker understanding fills out the elided repetitions once or twice, after which he goes on doing the recital with only the two end parts of the elisions. Here the one of less quick understanding says, “What is he reciting? Why, he does not even give one time to move one’s lips! If the recitation is done like this, when shall we ever get familiar with the text?” and so he does his recitation filling out each elision as it comes. Then the other says, “What is he reciting? Why, he never lets one get to the end of it! If the recitation is done like this; when shall we ever get to the end of it?” So too, the detailed discerning of the elements by head hairs, etc., appears redundant to one of quick understanding, though the meditation subject becomes clear to him if he gives his attention to it in brief in this way, “What has the characteristic of stiffenedness is the earth element,” and so on. But when the other gives his attention to it in this way, it appears obscure and unevident, and it only becomes plain to him if he gives his attention in detail by head hairs and so on.</p>
<p id="xi-41"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-41"><span class="std std-ref">§41</span></a> So firstly, one of quick understanding who wants to develop this meditation subject should go into solitary retreat. Then he should advert to his own entire material body and discern the elements in brief in this way: “In this body what is stiffenedness or harshness is the earth element, what is cohesion or fluidity <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id119" id="id40" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>71<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>   <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">352</span></code>  is the water element, what is maturing (ripening) or heat is the fire element, what is distension or movement is the air element.” And he should advert and give attention to it and review it again and again as “earth element, water element,” that is to say, as mere elements, not a living being, and soulless.</p>
<p id="xi-42"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-42"><span class="std std-ref">§42</span></a> As he makes effort in this way it is not long before concentration arises in him, which is reinforced by understanding that illuminates the classification of <em>[349/407]</em> the elements, and which is only access and does not reach absorption because it has states with individual essences as its object.</p>
<p id="xi-43"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-43"><span class="std std-ref">§43</span></a> Or alternatively, there are these four [bodily] parts mentioned by the General of the Dhamma [the Elder Sāriputta] for the purpose of showing the absence of any living being in the four great primary elements thus: “When a space is enclosed with bones and sinews and flesh and skin, there comes to be the term ‘material form’ (<em>rūpa</em>)” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id41"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 190</em> ). And he should resolve each of these [as a separate entity], separating them out by the hand of knowledge, and then discern them in the way already stated thus: “In these what is stiffenedness or harshness is the earth element.” And he should again and again advert to them, give attention to them and review them as mere elements, not a living being, not a soul.</p>
<p id="xi-44"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-44"><span class="std std-ref">§44</span></a> As he makes effort in this way, it is not long before concentration arises in him, which is reinforced by understanding that illuminates the classification of the elements, and which is only access and does not reach absorption because it has states with individual essences as its object.</p>
<p>This is the method of development when the definition of the elements is given in brief.</p>

<h3>2.5 Method of Development in Detail</h3>
<p id="xi-45"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-45"><span class="std std-ref">§45</span></a> The method given in detail should be understood in this way. A meditator of not over-quick understanding who wants to develop this meditation subject should learn the elements in detail in the forty-two aspects from a teacher, and he should live in an abode of the kind already described. Then, when he has done all the duties, he should go into solitary retreat and develop the meditation subject in four ways thus: (1) with constituents in brief, (2) with constituents by analysis, (3) with characteristics in brief, and (4) with characteristics by analysis.</p>
<section id="with-constituents-in-brief">
<h4>2.5.1 (1) With Constituents in Brief</h4>
<p id="xi-46"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-46"><span class="std std-ref">§46</span></a> Herein, how does he develop it <em>with constituents in brief</em>? Here a bhikkhu does his defining in this way, “In twenty of the parts what has the stiffened mode is the earth element,” and he does his defining thus, “In twelve parts the liquid called water with the mode of cohesion is the water element,”  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">353</span></code>  and he does his defining thus, “In four parts what matures (what has the mode of ripening) is the fire element,” and he does his defining thus, “In six parts what has the mode of distending is the air element.” As he defines them in this way they become evident to him. As he again and again adverts to them and gives his attention to them, concentration arises as access only.</p>
</section>
<section id="with-constituents-by-analysis">
<h4>2.5.2 (2) With Constituents by Analysis</h4>
<p id="xi-47"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-47"><span class="std std-ref">§47</span></a> However, if his meditation subject is not successful while he develops it in this way, then he should develop it <em>with constituents by analysis</em>. How? Firstly, the bhikkhu should carry out all the directions given for the thirty-two-fold aspect in the description of mindfulness occupied with the body as a meditation subject (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-08.xhtml#viii-48"><span class="std std-ref">VIII.48</span></a>–<a class="reference internal" href="ch-08.xhtml#viii-78"><span class="std std-ref">78</span></a>), namely, the sevenfold skill in learning and the tenfold skill in giving <em>[350/408]</em> attention, and he should start with the verbal recitation, in direct and reverse order, of the skin pentad and so on, without omitting any of it. The only difference is this: there, after giving attention to the head hairs, etc., as to colour, shape, direction, location, and delimitation, the mind had to be fixed by means of repulsiveness (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-08.xhtml#viii-83"><span class="std std-ref">VIII.83</span></a>), but here it is done by means of elements. Therefore at the end of each part after giving attention to head hairs, etc., each in the five ways beginning with colour (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-08.xhtml#viii-83"><span class="std std-ref">VIII.83</span></a>), attention should be given as follows.</p>
<p id="xi-48"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-48"><span class="std std-ref">§48</span></a> These things called <em>head hairs</em> grow on the inner skin that envelops the skull. Herein, just as when <em>kuṇṭha</em> grasses grow on the top of an anthill, the top of the termite-mound does not know, “<em>Kuṇṭha</em> grasses are growing on me,” nor do the <em>kuṇṭha</em> grasses know, “We are growing on the top of a termite-mound,” so too, the inner skin that covers the skull does not know, “Head hairs grow on me,” nor do the head hairs know, “We grow on inner skin that envelops a skull.” These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what are called <em>head hairs</em> are a particular component of this body, without thought, [morally] indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid (stiffened) earth element.</p>
<p id="xi-49"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-49"><span class="std std-ref">§49</span></a> <em>Body hairs</em> grow on the inner skin that envelops the body. Herein, just as, when <em>dabba</em> grasses grow on the square in an empty village, the square in the empty village does not know*, “Dabba* grasses grow on me,” nor do the <em>dabba</em> grasses know, “We grow on the square in an empty village,” so too, the inner skin that envelops the body does not know, “Body hairs grow on me,” nor do the body hairs know, “We grow on inner skin that envelops a body.” These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what are called <em>body hairs</em> are a particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid earth element.</p>
<p id="xi-50"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-50"><span class="std std-ref">§50</span></a> <em>Nails</em> grow on the tips of the fingers and toes. Herein, just as, when children play a game by piercing <em>madhuka</em>-fruit kernels with sticks, the sticks  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">354</span></code>  do not know, <em>“Madhuka</em>-fruit kernels are put on us,” nor do the <em>madhuka</em>-fruit kernels know, “We are put on sticks,” so too, the fingers and toes do not know, “Nails grow on our tips,” nor do the nails know, “We grow on the tips of fingers and toes.” These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what are called <em>nails</em> are a particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid earth element.</p>
<p id="xi-51"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-51"><span class="std std-ref">§51</span></a> <em>Teeth</em> grow in the jaw bones. Herein, just as, when posts are placed by builders in stone sockets and fastened with some kind of cement, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id120" id="id42" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>72<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  the sockets do not know, “Posts are placed in us,” nor do the posts know, “We are placed in sockets,” so too, the jaw bones do not know, “Teeth grow in us,” nor do the teeth know, “We grow in jaw bones’.” These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what are called <em>teeth</em> are a particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid earth element.</p>
<p id="xi-52"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-52"><span class="std std-ref">§52</span></a> <em>Skin</em> is to be found covering the whole body. Herein, just as, when a big lute is covered with damp ox-hide, the lute does not know, “I am covered with damp ox-hide,” nor does the damp ox-hide know, “A lute is covered by me,” so too, the <em>[351/409]</em> body does not know, “I am covered by skin,” nor does the skin know, “A body is covered by me.” These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what is called <em>skin</em> is a particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid earth element.</p>
<p id="xi-53"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-53"><span class="std std-ref">§53</span></a> <em>Flesh</em> is to be found plastered over the framework of bones. Herein, just as, when a wall is plastered with thick clay, the wall does not know, “I am plastered with thick clay,” nor does the thick clay know, “A wall is plastered with me,” so too, the framework of bones does not know, “I am plastered with flesh consisting of nine hundred pieces of flesh,” nor does the flesh know, “A framework of bones is plastered with me.” These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what is called <em>flesh</em> is a particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid earth element.</p>
<p id="xi-54"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-54"><span class="std std-ref">§54</span></a> <em>Sinews</em> are to be found in the interior of the body binding the bones together. Herein, just as, when withies and sticks are bound together with creepers, the withies and sticks do not know  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">355</span></code>  “We are bound together with creepers,” nor do the creepers know, “Withies and sticks are bound together by us,” so too, the bones do not know, “We are bound by sinews,” nor do the sinews know, “Bones are bound together by us.” These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what are called <em>sinews</em> are a particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid earth element.</p>
<p id="xi-55"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-55"><span class="std std-ref">§55</span></a> As to the <em>bones</em>, the heel bone is to be found holding up the ankle bone, the ankle bone holding up the shin bone, the shin bone the thigh bone, the thigh bone the hip bone, the hip bone the backbone, the backbone the neck bone, and the neck bone is to be found holding up the cranium bone. The cranium bone rests on the neck bone, the neck bone on the backbone, the backbone on the hip bone, the hip bone on the thigh bone, the thigh bone on the shin bone, the shin bone on the ankle bone, the ankle bone on the heel bone.</p>
<p id="xi-56"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-56"><span class="std std-ref">§56</span></a> Herein, just as, when bricks, timber or [blocks of dried] cow dung are built up, those below do not know, “We each stand holding up those above us,” nor do those above know, “We each rest on those below us,” so too, the heel bone does not know, “I stand holding up the ankle bone,” nor does the ankle bone know, “I stand holding up the shin bone,” nor does the shin bone know, “I stand holding up the thigh bone,” nor does the thigh bone know, “I stand holding up the hip bone,” nor does the hip bone know, “I stand holding up the backbone,” nor does the backbone know, “I stand holding up the neck bone,” nor does the neck bone know, “I stand holding up the cranium bone,” nor does the cranium bone know, “I rest on the neck bone,” nor does the neck bone know, “I rest on the backbone,” nor does the backbone know, “I rest on the hip bone,” nor does the hip bone know, “I rest on the thigh bone,” nor does the thigh bone know, “I rest on the shin bone,” nor does the shin bone know, “I rest on the ankle bone,” nor does the ankle bone know, “I rest on the heel bone.” These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what are called <em>bones</em>  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">356</span></code>  are a particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid earth element.</p>
<p id="xi-57"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-57"><span class="std std-ref">§57</span></a> <em>[352/410]</em> <em>Bone marrow</em> is to be found inside the various bones. Herein, just as, when boiled bamboo sprouts, etc., are put inside bamboo joints, etc., the bamboo joints, etc., do not know, “Bamboo sprouts, etc., are put in us,” nor do the bamboo sprouts, etc., know, “We are inside bamboo joints, etc.,” so too, the bones do not know, “Marrow is inside us,” nor does the bone marrow know, “I am inside bones.” These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what is called <em>bone marrow</em> is a particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid earth element.</p>
<p id="xi-58"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-58"><span class="std std-ref">§58</span></a> <em>Kidney</em> is to be found on each side of the heart flesh, being fastened by the stout sinew that starts out with a single root from the base of the neck and divides into two after going a short way. Herein, just as, when a pair of mango fruits are bound together by their stalk, the stalk does not know, “A pair of mango fruits is bound together by me,” nor do the pair of mango fruits know, “We are bound together by a stalk,” so too, the stout sinew does not know, “Kidneys are bound together by me,” nor does the kidney know, “I am bound together by a stout sinew.” These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what is called <em>kidney</em> is a particular component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid earth element.</p>
<p id="xi-59"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-59"><span class="std std-ref">§59</span></a> <em>Heart</em> is to be found in the inside of the body near the middle of the frame of the ribs. Herein, just as, when a piece of meat is placed near the framework of an old cart, the inside of the framework of the old cart does not know, “A piece of meat is placed near the middle of me,” nor does the piece of meat know, “I am near the middle of the inside of the framework of an old cart,” so too, the inside of the framework of the ribs does not know, “A heart is near the middle of me,” nor does the heart know, “I am near the middle of the inside of a framework of ribs.” These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing.

<h3>2.6 Additional Ways of Giving Attention</h3>
<p id="xi-86"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-86"><span class="std std-ref">§86</span></a> In addition, attention should be given to the elements in the following ways: (1) as to word meaning, (2) by groups, (3) by particles, (4) by characteristic, etc., (5) as to how originated, (6) as to variety and unity, (7) as to resolution (separability) and non-resolution (inseparability), (8) as to the similar and the dissimilar, (9) as to distinction between internal and external, (10) as to inclusion, (11) as to condition, (12) as to lack of conscious reaction, (13) as to analysis of conditions.</p>
<p id="xi-87"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-87"><span class="std std-ref">§87</span></a> <em>1.</em> Herein, one who gives his attention to them <em>as to word meaning</em> should do so separately and generally thus: [separately] it is earth (<em>pathavī</em>) because it is spread out (<em>patthaṭa</em>); it flows (<em>appoti</em>) or it glides (<em>āpiyati</em>) or it satisfies (<em>appāyati</em>), thus it is water (<em>āpo</em>); it heats (<em>tejati</em>), thus it is fire (<em>tejo</em>); it blows (<em>vāyati</em>), thus it is air (<em>vāyo</em>). But without differentiation they are elements (<em>dhātu</em>) because of bearing (<em>dhāraṇa</em>) their own characteristics, because of grasping (<em>ādāna</em>) suffering, and because of sorting out (<em>ādhāna</em>) suffering (see <a class="reference internal" href="ch-15.xhtml#xv-19"><span class="std std-ref">XV.19</span></a>). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id125" id="id45" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>75<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  This is how they should be given attention as to word meaning.</p>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Colour, odour, taste, and nutritive</div>
<div class="line">Essence, and the four elements—</div>

<p>Consequently, head hairs are only a mere group of eight states. Likewise, body hairs,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">365</span></code>  and the rest. A component here that is kamma-originated is a group of ten states, [that is to say, the former eight] together with the life faculty and sex.

And this body, being distended by the latter kind of air, does not collapse, but stands erect, and being propelled <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id142" id="id52" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>82<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  by the other [motile] air, it shows intimation and it flexes and extends and it wriggles the hands and feet, doing so in the postures comprising of walking, standing, sitting and lying down. So this mechanism of elements carries on like a magic trick, deceiving foolish people with the male and female sex and so on.</p>
<p>This is how they should be given attention by particles.</p>
<p id="xi-93"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-93"><span class="std std-ref">§93</span></a> <em>4. As to characteristic, etc</em>.: he should advert to the four elements in this way: “The earth element—what are its characteristic, function, manifestation?” [defining them in this way]: The earth element has the characteristic of hardness. Its function is to act as a foundation. It is manifested as receiving. The water element has the characteristic of trickling. Its function is to intensify. It is manifested as holding together. The fire element has the characteristic of heat. Its function is to mature (maintain). It is manifested as a continued supply of softness. The air element has the characteristic of distending. Its function is to cause motion. It is manifested as conveying. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id143" id="id53" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>83<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  This is how they should be given attention to by characteristic, and so on.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">366</span></code></p>
<p id="xi-94"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-94"><span class="std std-ref">§94</span></a> <em>5. As to how originated</em>: among the forty-two components beginning with head hairs shown in the detailed treatment of the earth element, etc., the four consisting of gorge, dung, pus, and urine are temperature-originated only; the four consisting of tears, sweat, spittle, and snot are temperature-originated and consciousness-originated only. The fire that cooks what is eaten, etc., is kamma-originated only; in-breath and out-breath are consciousness-originated only; all <em>[361/419]</em> the rest are of fourfold origination. This is how they should be given attention as to how originated.</p>
<p id="xi-95"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-95"><span class="std std-ref">§95</span></a> <em>6. As to variety and unity</em>: there is variety in the specific characteristics, etc., of all the elements; for the characteristic, function, and manifestation of the earth element is one, and those of the water element, etc., are different. But there is unity in them as materiality, great primary, element, state (<em>dhamma</em>), impermanence, etc., notwithstanding the fact that they are various according to [specific] characteristic, etc., and according to origination by kamma and so on.</p>
<p id="xi-96"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-96"><span class="std std-ref">§96</span></a> All these elements are “instances of materiality” (<em>rūpāni</em>) because they do not exceed the characteristic of “being molested” (<em>ruppana</em>). They are “great primaries” (<em>mahābhūta</em>) by reason of “great manifestation,” and so on. “By reason of ‘great manifestation,’ and so on” means that these elements are called “great primaries” for the following reasons, namely: (a) manifestation of greatness; (b) likeness to great creatures; (c) great maintenance; (d) great alteration; and (e) because they are great and because they are entities.</p>
<p id="xi-97"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-97"><span class="std std-ref">§97</span></a> Herein, (a) <em>manifestation of greatness</em>: they are manifested as great both in a continuity that is not clung to (acquired through kamma) and in a continuity that is clung to. For their manifestation of greatness in a continuity that is not clung to is given in the description of the recollection of the Buddha in the way beginning:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Two times a hundred thousand [leagues]</div>
<div class="line">And then four <em>nahutas</em> as well:</div>
<div class="line">This earth, this “bearer of all wealth,”</div>
<div class="line">Has that much thickness, as they tell (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-07.xhtml#vii-41"><span class="std std-ref">VII.41</span></a>).</div>
</div>
<p>And they are manifested on a great scale also in a continuity that is clung to, for instance, in the bodies of fishes, turtles, deities, Dānava demons, and so on. For this is said: “Bhikkhus, there are individual creatures of a hundred leagues in the great ocean” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id54"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>IV 207</em> ), and so on.</p>
<p id="xi-98"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-98"><span class="std std-ref">§98</span></a> (b) <em>Likeness to great creatures</em>: just as a magician turns water that is not crystal into crystal, and turns a clod that is not gold into gold, and shows them, and being himself neither a spirit nor a bird, shows himself as a spirit or a bird, so too, being themselves not blue-black, they turn themselves into blue-black derived materiality, being themselves not yellow … not red … not white,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">367</span></code>  they turn themselves into white derived materiality and show that. In this way they are “great primaries” (<em>mahābhūta</em>) in being like the great creatures (<em>mahābhūta</em>) of a magician. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id146" id="id55" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>84<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="xi-99"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-99"><span class="std std-ref">§99</span></a> <em>[362/420]</em> And just as, whomsoever the great creatures such as the spirits (<em>yakkha</em>) grasp hold of (possess), they have no standing place either inside him or outside him and yet they have no standing independently of him, so too, these elements are not found to stand either inside or outside each other yet they have no standing independently of one another. Thus they are also great primaries (<em>mahābhūta</em>) in being equal to the great creatures (<em>mahābhūta</em>) such as the spirits because they have no thinkable standing place [relative to each other].</p>
<p id="xi-100"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-100"><span class="std std-ref">§100</span></a> And just as the great creatures known as female spirits (<em>yakkhinī</em>) conceal their own fearfulness with a pleasing colour, shape and gesture to deceive beings, so too, these elements conceal each their own characteristic and function classed as hardness, etc., by means of a pleasing skin colour of women’s and men’s bodies, etc., and pleasing shapes of limbs and pleasing gestures of fingers, toes and eyebrows, and they deceive simple people by concealing their own functions and characteristics beginning with hardness and do not allow their individual essences to be seen. Thus they are great primaries (<em>mahābhūta</em>) in being equal to the great creatures (<em>mahābhūta</em>), the female spirits, since they are deceivers.</p>
<p id="xi-101"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-101"><span class="std std-ref">§101</span></a> (c) <em>Great maintenance</em>: this is because they have to be sustained by the great requisites. For these elements are great primaries (<em>mahābhūta</em>) since they have become (<em>bhūta</em>), have occurred, by means of the food, clothing, etc., which are great (<em>mahant</em>) [in importance] because they have to be found every day. Or alternatively, they are great primaries (<em>mahābhūta</em>) since they are primaries whose maintenance is great.</p>
<p id="xi-102"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-102"><span class="std std-ref">§102</span></a> (d) <em>Great alteration</em>: the unclung-to and the clung-to are the [basis of] great alterations. Herein, the great alteration of the unclung-to evidences itself in the emergence of an aeon (see <a class="reference internal" href="ch-13.xhtml#xiii-34"><span class="std std-ref">XIII.34</span></a>), and that of the clung-to in the disturbance of the elements [in the body]. For accordingly:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The conflagration’s flame bursts up</div>
<div class="line">Out of the ground and races higher</div>
<div class="line">And higher, right to the Brahmā heaven,</div>
<div class="line">When the world is burnt up by fire.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A whole world system measuring</div>
<div class="line">One hundred thousand millions wide</div>
<div class="line">Subsides, as with its furious waters</div>
<div class="line">The flood dissolves the world beside.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>[363/421]</em> One hundred thousand million leagues,</div>
<div class="line">A whole world system’s broad extent</div>
<div class="line">Is rent and scattered, when the world</div>
<div class="line">Succumbs to the air element.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">

</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The bite of rotten-mouths can make</div>
<div class="line">The body rot; to all intent,</div>
<div class="line">When roused its water element,</div>
<div class="line">It might be gripped by such a snake.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">368</span></code></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The bite of fiery-mouths can make</div>
<div class="line">The body burn; to all intent,</div>
<div class="line">When roused is its fire element,</div>
<div class="line">It might be gripped by such a snake.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The bite of dagger-mouths can make</div>
<div class="line">The body burst; to all intent,</div>
<div class="line">When roused is its air element,</div>
<div class="line">It might be gripped by such a snake.</div>
</div>
<p>So they are great primaries (<em>mahābhūta</em>) because they have become (<em>bhūta</em>) [the basis of] great (<em>mahant</em>) alteration.</p>
<p id="xi-103"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-103"><span class="std std-ref">§103</span></a> (e) <em>Because they are great and because they are entities</em>: “great” (<em>mahant</em>) because they need great effort to discern them, and “entities” (<em>bhūta</em> = become) because they are existent; thus they are great primaries (<em>mahābhūta</em>) because they are great (<em>mahā</em>) and because they are entities (<em>bhūta</em>).</p>
<p>This is how all these elements are “great primaries” by reason of “great manifestation,” and so on.</p>
<p id="xi-104"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-104"><span class="std std-ref">§104</span></a> Again, they are elements (<em>dhātu</em>) because of bearing (<em>dhāraṇa</em>) their own characteristics, because of grasping (<em>ādāna</em>) suffering, and because of sorting out (<em>ādhāna</em>) suffering (see <a class="reference internal" href="ch-15.xhtml#xv-19"><span class="std std-ref">XV.19</span></a>), and because none of them are exempt from the characteristic of being elements.</p>
<p>They are states (<em>dhamma</em>) owing to bearing (<em>dhāraṇa</em>) their own characteristics and owing to their so bearing (<em>dhāraṇa</em>) for the length of the moment appropriate to them. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id148" id="id56" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>85<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  They are impermanent in the sense of [liability to] destruction; they are painful in the sense of [causing] terror; they are not self in the sense of having no core [of permanence, and so on]. Thus there is unity of all since all are materiality, great primaries, elements, states, impermanent, and so on.</p>
<p>This is how they should be given attention “as to variety and unity.”</p>
<p id="xi-105"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-105"><span class="std std-ref">§105</span></a> <em>7. As to resolution</em> (<em>separability</em>) <em>and non-resolution</em> (<em>inseparability</em>): they are positionally unresolvable (inseparable) since they always arise together in every <em>[364/422]</em> single minimal material group consisting of the bare octad and the others; but they are resolvable (separable) by characteristic. This is how they should be given attention “as to resolution (separability) and non-resolution (inseparability).”</p>
<p id="xi-106"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-106"><span class="std std-ref">§106</span></a> <em>8. As to the similar and dissimilar</em>: and although they are unresolved (inseparable) in this way, yet the first two similar in heaviness, and so are the last two in lightness; but [for this reason] the first two are dissimilar to the last two and the last two to the first two. This is how they should be given attention “as to the similar and dissimilar.”</p>
<p id="xi-107"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-107"><span class="std std-ref">§107</span></a> <em>9. As to distinction between internal and external</em>: the internal elements are the [material] support for the physical bases of consciousness, for the kinds of intimation, and for the material faculties. They are associated with postures, and they are of fourfold origination. The external elements are of the opposite kind. This is how they should be given attention “as to distinction between internal and external.”</p>
<p id="xi-108"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-108"><span class="std std-ref">§108</span></a> <em>10. As to inclusion</em>: kamma-originated earth element is included together with the other kamma-originated elements because there is no difference in their origination. Likewise the consciousness-originated is included together with other consciousness-originated elements. This is how they should be given attention “as to inclusion.”</p>
<p id="xi-109"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-109"><span class="std std-ref">§109</span></a> <em>11. As to condition</em>: the earth element, which is held together by water, maintained by fire and distended by air, is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their foundation. The water element, which is founded on earth, maintained by fire and distended by air, is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their cohesion. The fire element, which is founded on earth, held together by water  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">369</span></code>  and distended by air, is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their maintaining. The air element, which is founded on earth, held together by water, and maintained by fire, is a condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their distension. This is how they should be given attention “as to condition.”</p>
<p id="xi-110"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-110"><span class="std std-ref">§110</span></a> <em>12. As to lack of conscious reaction</em>: here too the earth element does not know, “I am the earth element” or “I am a condition by acting as a foundation for three great primaries.” And the other three do not know, “The earth element is a condition for us by acting as a foundation for three great primaries.” And the other three do not know, “The earth element is a condition for us by acting as our foundation.” And similarly in each instance. This is how they should be given attention “as to lack of conscious reaction.”</p>
<p id="xi-111"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-111"><span class="std std-ref">§111</span></a> <em>13. As to analysis of conditions</em>: there are four conditions for the elements, that is to say, kamma, consciousness, nutriment, and temperature.</p>
<p>Herein, <em>kamma</em> only is the condition for the kamma-originated [elements]; <em>consciousness</em> (<em>citta</em>), etc. [i.e. nutriment and temperature] are not. Consciousness, etc., only are the conditions for the consciousness-originated [elements]; the others are not. <em>Kamma</em> is the producing condition <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id150" id="id57" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>86<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  for the kamma-originated <em>[365/423]</em> elements; for the rest it is indirectly the decisive-supportive condition. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id153" id="id58" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>87<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  <em>Consciousness</em> is the producing condition for the consciousness-originated elements; for the rest it is the post-nascence condition, presence condition and non-disappearance condition. <em>Nutriment</em> is the producing condition for the nutriment-originated elements; for the rest it is the nutriment condition, presence condition and non-disappearance condition. <em>Temperature</em> is the productive condition for the temperature-originated elements; for the rest it is the presence condition and non-disappearance condition.</p>
<p>Herein, the kamma-originated great primary is the condition for the kamma-originated great primaries, and also for the consciousness-originated [great primaries]. Likewise are the consciousness-originated [great primary] and the nutriment originated [great primary]. The temperature-originated great primary is the condition for the temperature-originated great primaries, and also for the kamma-originated [great primaries], and so on (cf. <a class="reference internal" href="ch-20.xhtml#xx-27"><span class="std std-ref">XX.27f.</span></a>).</p>
<p id="xi-112"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-112"><span class="std std-ref">§112</span></a> Herein, the kamma-originated earth element is a condition for the other kamma-originated elements both as conascence, mutuality, support, presence, and non-disappearance conditions and as foundation, but not as producing condition. It is a condition for the other [three] great primaries in a triple continuity (see <a class="reference internal" href="ch-20.xhtml#xx-22"><span class="std std-ref">XX.22</span></a>) as support, presence and non-disappearance conditions, but not as foundation or producing condition. And here the water element is a condition for the remaining three elements both as conascence, etc., conditions and as cohesion, but not as producing condition. And for the others in a triple continuity it is a condition as support, presence, and non-disappearance conditions too, but not as cohesion or producing condition. And the fire element here is a condition for the other three elements both as conascence, etc., conditions and as maintaining but not as producing condition. And for the others in a triple continuity it is a condition as support, presence, and non-disappearance conditions too, but not as maintaining or producing condition. And the air element here is a condition for the other three elements  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">370</span></code>  both as conascence, etc., conditions and as distension, but not as producing condition. And for the others in a triple continuity it is a condition as support, presence, and non-disappearance conditions too, but not as distension or producing condition.</p>
<p id="xi-113"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-113"><span class="std std-ref">§113</span></a> The same method applies in the case of the consciousness-originated, the nutriment-originated, and the temperature-originated earth element, and the rest. And when these elements have been made to occur through the influence of the conascence, etc., conditions:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>[366/424]</em> With three in four ways to one due,</div>
<div class="line">And likewise with one due to three;</div>
<div class="line">With two in six ways due to two—</div>
<div class="line">Thus their occurrence comes to be.</div>
</div>
<p id="xi-114"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-114"><span class="std std-ref">§114</span></a> Taking each one, beginning with earth, there are three others whose occurrence is due to that one, thus with three due to one their occurrence takes place in four ways. Likewise each one, beginning with earth, occurs in dependence on the other three, thus with one due to three their occurrence takes place in four ways. But with the last two dependent on the first two, with the first two dependent on the last two, with the second and fourth dependent on the first and third, with the first and third dependent on the second and fourth, with the second and third dependent on the first and fourth, and with the first and fourth dependent on the second and third, they occur in six ways with two elements due to two.</p>
<p id="xi-115"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-115"><span class="std std-ref">§115</span></a> At the time of moving forward and moving backward ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id59"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 57</em> ), the earth element among these is a condition for pressing. That, seconded by the water element, is a condition for establishing on a foundation. But the water element seconded by the earth element is a condition for lowering down. The fire element seconded by the air element is a condition for lifting up. The air element seconded by the fire element is a condition for shifting forwards and shifting sideways (see <a class="reference internal" href="ch-20.xhtml#xx-62"><span class="std std-ref">XX.62f.</span></a> and  <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m-a" id="id60"><span>[M-a]</span></a> <em>I 160</em> ).</p>
<p>This is how they should be given attention “as to analysis of conditions.”</p>
<p id="xi-116"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-116"><span class="std std-ref">§116</span></a> As he gives his attention to them “as to word meaning,” etc., in this way, the elements become evident to him under each heading. As he again and again adverts and gives attention to them access concentration arises in the way already described. And this concentration too is called “definition of the four elements” because it arises in one who defines the four elements owing to the influence of his knowledge.</p>
<p id="xi-117"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-117"><span class="std std-ref">§117</span></a> This bhikkhu who is devoted to the defining of the four elements immerses himself in voidness and eliminates the perception of living beings. Since he does not entertain false notions about wild beasts, spirits, ogres, etc., because he has abolished the perception of living beings, he conquers fear and dread and conquers delight and aversion (boredom); he is not exhilarated or depressed <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id157" id="id61" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>88<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  by agreeable and disagreeable things; and as one of great understanding, he either ends in the deathless or he is bound for a happy destiny.</p>

<h2>3 Development of Concentration—Conclusion</h2>
<p id="xi-118"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-118"><span class="std std-ref">§118</span></a> <em>[367/425]</em> This completes in all its aspects the commentary on the meaning of the clause, “How should it be developed?” in the set of questions beginning with “What is concentration?” which was formulated in order to show the method of development of concentration in detail (see <a class="reference internal" href="ch-03.xhtml#iii-1"><span class="std std-ref">III.1</span></a>).</p>
<p id="xi-119"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-119"><span class="std std-ref">§119</span></a> This concentration as intended here is twofold, that is to say, access concentration and absorption concentration. Herein, the unification [of mind] in the case of ten meditation subjects and in the consciousness preceding absorption [in the case of the remaining meditation subjects] <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id159" id="id63" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>90<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  is access concentration. The unification of mind in the case of the remaining meditation subjects is absorption concentration. And so it is developed in two forms with the development of these meditation subjects. Hence it was said above: “This completes in all its aspects the commentary on the meaning of the clause, ‘How should it be developed?’”</p>
<section id="the-benefits-of-developing-concentration">
<h3>3.1 The Benefits of Developing Concentration</h3>
<p id="xi-120"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-120"><span class="std std-ref">§120</span></a> The question, (viii) <em>what are the benefits of the development of concentration?</em> was also asked, however (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-03.xhtml#iii-1"><span class="std std-ref">III.1</span></a>). Herein, the benefits of the development of concentration are fivefold, as a blissful abiding here and now, and so on. For the development of absorption concentration provides the benefit of a blissful abiding here and now for the Arahants with cankers destroyed who develop concentration, thinking, “We shall attain and dwell with unified mind for a whole day.” Hence the Blessed One said: “But, Cunda, it is not these that are called effacement in the Noble Ones’ discipline; these are called blissful abidings in the Noble Ones’ discipline” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id64"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 40</em> ).</p>
<p id="xi-121"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-121"><span class="std std-ref">§121</span></a> When ordinary people and trainers develop it, thinking, “After emerging, we shall exercise insight with concentrated consciousness,” the development of absorption concentration provides them with the benefit of insight by serving as the proximate cause for insight, and so too does access concentration as a method of arriving at wide open [conditions] in crowded [circumstances]. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id161" id="id65" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>91<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  Hence the Blessed One said: “Bhikkhus, develop concentration; a bhikkhu who is concentrated understands correctly” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id66"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>III 13</em> ).</p>
<p id="xi-122"><a class="reference internal" href="#xi-122"><span class="std std-ref">§122</span></a> But when they have already produced the eight attainments and then, aspiring to the kinds of direct-knowledge described in the way beginning, “Having been one, he becomes many” (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-12.xhtml#xii-2"><span class="std std-ref">XII.2</span></a>), they produce them by entering upon jhāna as the basis for direct-knowledge and emerging from it, then the development of absorption concentration provides for them the benefit of the kinds of direct-knowledge, since it becomes the proximate cause for the kinds of direct-knowledge whenever there is an occasion. Hence the Blessed One said: <em>[368/426]</em> “He attains the ability to be a witness, through realization by direct-knowledge, of any state realizable by direct-knowledge to which his mind inclines, whenever there is an occasion” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id67"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>III 96</em> ;  <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id68"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>I 254</em> ).  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">372</span></code></p>

Hence the Blessed One said: “Where do they reappear after developing the first jhāna limitedly? They reappear in the company of the deities of Brahmā’s Retinue” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vibh" id="id69"><span>[Vibh]</span></a> <em>424</em> ), and so on.

Hence it is said: “Understanding as mastery owing to … sixteen kinds of behaviour of knowledge, and to nine kinds of behaviour of concentration, is knowledge of the attainment of cessation” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id70"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 97</em> ; see <a class="reference internal" href="ch-23.xhtml#xxiii-18"><span class="std std-ref">Ch.

<p>“The word ‘perception’ (<em>saññā</em>) is used for the <em>dhamma</em> with the characteristic of perceiving (<em>sañjānana</em>), as in the case of ‘perception of visible objects,’ ‘perception of sound,’ etc.; and it is used for insight, as in the case of ‘perception of impermanence,’ ‘perception of suffering,’ etc.; and it is used for serenity, as in the passage, ‘Perception of the bloated and perception of visible objects, have these one meaning or different meanings, Sopāka?’ (<em>Source untraced.</em> Cf. <a class="reference internal" href="ch-03.xhtml#iii-111"><span class="std std-ref">III.111</span></a>), and so on. Here, however, it should be understood as the preliminary work for serenity; for it is the apprehending of the repulsive aspect in nutriment, or the access jhāna produced by means of that, that is intended here by, ‘perception of repulsiveness in nutriment’”( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vism-mht" id="id73"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>334–335</em> ).</p>

<p>A more detailed exposition of nutriment is given at  <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m-a" id="id75"><span>[M-a]</span></a> <em>I 107ff.</em>  “‘It nourishes’ (<em>āharati</em>)”: the meaning is that it leads up, fetches, produces, its own fruit through its state as a condition for the fruit’s arising or presence, which state is called “nutriment condition.” It is made into a mouthful (<em>kabalaṃ karīyati</em>), thus it is physical (<em>kabaliṅkāra</em>). In this way it gets its designation from the concrete object; but as to characteristic, it should be understood to have the characteristic of nutritive essence (<em>ojā</em>). It is physical and it is nutriment in the sense stated, thus it is physical nutriment; so with the rest. It touches (<em>phusati</em>), thus it is contact (<em>phassa</em>); for although this is an immaterial state, it occurs also as the aspect of touching on an object (<em>ārammaṇa—</em>lit. “what is to be leaned on”), which is why it is said to have the characteristic of touching. It wills (<em>cetayati</em>), thus it is volition (<em>cetanā</em>); the meaning is that it arranges (collects) itself together with associated states upon the object. Mental volition is volition occupied with the mind. It cognizes (<em>vijānāti</em>) by conjecturing about rebirth (see <a class="reference internal" href="ch-17.xhtml#xvii-303"><span class="std std-ref">XVII.303</span></a>), thus it is consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em> = cognition) ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vism-mht" id="id76"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>335</em> ).</p>

<p><a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vism-mht" id="id79"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>(p. 355)</em>  explains <em>attachment</em> here as craving which is “perilous because it brings harm” (see e.g.  <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#d" id="id80"><span>[D]</span></a> <em>II 58–59</em> ), or in other words, “greed for the five aggregates (lust after five-aggregate experience).” It cites the following: “Bhikkhus, when there is physical nutriment, there is greed (lust), there is delighting, there is craving; consciousness being planted therein grows. Wherever consciousness being planted grows, there is the combination of mind-and-matter. Wherever there is the combination of mind-and-matter, there is ramification of formations. Wherever there is ramification of formations, there is production of further becoming in the future. Wherever there is production of further becoming in the future, there is future birth, aging and death. Wherever there is future birth, aging and death, bhikkhus, the end is sorrow, I say, with woe and despair” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id81"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>II 101</em> ; cf.  <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id82"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>II 66</em> ). <em>Approaching</em> is explained as “meeting, coinciding, with unabandoned perversions [of perception] due to an object [being perceived as permanent, etc., when it is not].” That is, “perilous since it is not free from the three kinds of suffering.” The quotation given is: “Bhikkhus, due to contact of the kind to be felt as pleasant, pleasant feeling arises. With that feeling as condition there is craving, … thus there is the arising of this whole mass of suffering” (cf.  <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id83"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>IV 215</em> ). <em>Reappearance</em> is “rebirth in some kind of becoming or other. Being flung into a new becoming is perilous because there is no immunity from the risks rooted in reappearance.” The following is quoted: “Not knowing, bhikkhus, a man forms the formation of merit, and his [rebirth] consciousness accords with the merit [tie performed]; he forms the formation of demerit; … he forms the formation of the imperturbable …” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id84"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>II 82</em> ). <em>Rebirth-linking</em> is the actual linking with the next becoming, which “is perilous since it is not immune from the suffering due to the signs of [the impending] rebirth-linking.” The quotation given is: “Bhikkhus, when there is consciousness as nutriment there is greed (lust), there is delighting …” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id85"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>II 102</em> —complete as above).</p>

So there is inconstancy of posture too. Then ‘twenty or thirty’ is taken as the number already observed by the time of setting out on the alms round.

<p><em>“‘From resolution of these eight’</em>: the eight dhammas beginning with colour when resolved by means of understanding, are apprehendable <em>(upalabbhanti)</em> in the ultimate sense through mutual negation <em>(aññam-añña-vyatirekena);</em> but head hairs are not apprehendable in the ultimate sense through negation of colour and so on. Consequently, the term of common usage ‘head hairs’ is applied to these dhammas in their co-arisen state; but if they are each taken separately, <em>‘There is no common-usage head hairs.’</em> The meaning is that it is a mere conventional term. <em>‘Only a mere group of eight states’</em> is said, taking the colour, etc., which are real <em>(bhūta—lit.</em> ‘become’), as a unity by means of the concept <em>(paññatti)</em> ‘a head hair,’ not only because they are merely the eight states” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vism-mht" id="id129"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>360</em> ).</p>

<p>“A great primary <em>(mahābhūta)</em> is a great wonder <em>(mahanto abbhuto)</em> because it shows various unreal things <em>(abhūta),</em> various wonders <em>(abbhuta),</em> and various marvels <em>(acchariya).</em> Or alternatively: there are great wonders <em>(abbhuta)</em> here, thus there are magicians. And spirits, etc., are huge <em>(mahant)</em> creatures <em>(bhūta)</em> owing to being born from them, thus they are great primaries. Or alternatively: this term ‘great primary’ can be regarded as a generic term for all of them. But earth, etc., are great primaries because they deceive, and because, like the huge creatures, their standing place cannot be pointed to. The deception lies in causing the apparent individual essences of blue-black, etc., and it lies in causing the appearance of what has the aspect of woman and man, and so on. Likewise their undemonstrability, since they are not found inside or outside each other though they rely upon each other for support. For if these elements were found inside each other, they would not each perform their particular functions, owing to mutual frustration. And if they were found outside each other, they would be already resolved (separate), and that being so, any description of them as unresolved (inseparable) would be meaningless. So although their standing place is undemonstrable, still each one assists the other by its particular function—the functions of establishing, etc., whereby each becomes a condition for the others as conascence condition and so on” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vism-mht" id="id147"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>363</em> ).</p>
