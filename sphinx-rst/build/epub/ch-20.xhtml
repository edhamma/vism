<h3>1.1 The Fifth Purification</h3>
<p id="xx-2"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-2"><span class="std std-ref">§2</span></a> One who desires to accomplish this should first of all apply himself to the inductive insight called “comprehension by groups. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id74" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>39<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> ” Why? Because knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path appears in connection with the appearance of illumination, etc. (<a class="reference internal" href="#xx-105"><span class="std std-ref">XX.105f.</span></a>) in one who has begun insight. For it is after illumination, etc., have appeared in one who has already begun insight that there comes to be knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path. And comprehension by groups is the beginning of insight. That is why it is set forth next to the overcoming of doubt. Besides, knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path arises when “full-understanding as investigation” is occurring, and full-understanding as investigation comes next to full-understanding as the known (see <a class="reference internal" href="ch-19.xhtml#xix-21"><span class="std std-ref">XIX.21</span></a>). So this is also a reason why one who desires to accomplish this purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path should first of all apply himself to comprehension by groups.</p>

<section id="the-three-kinds-of-full-understanding">
<h3>1.2 The Three Kinds of Full-Understanding</h3>
<p id="xx-3"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-3"><span class="std std-ref">§3</span></a> Here is the exposition: there are three kinds of mundane full-understanding, that is, full-understanding as the known, full-understanding as investigation, and full-understanding as abandoning, with reference to which it was said: “Understanding that is direct-knowledge is knowledge in the sense of being known. Understanding that is full-understanding is knowledge in the sense of <em>[632/690]</em> investigating. Understanding that is abandoning is knowledge in the sense of giving up” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id2"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 87</em> ).</p>
<p>Herein, the understanding that occurs by observing the specific characteristics of such and such states thus, “Materiality (<em>rūpa</em>) has the characteristic of being molested (<em>ruppana</em>); feeling has the characteristic of being felt,” is called <em>full-understanding as the known.</em> The understanding consisting in insight with the general characteristics as its object that occurs in attributing a general characteristic to those same states in the way beginning, “Materiality is impermanent,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">607</span></code>  feeling is impermanent” is called <em>full-understanding as investigation.</em> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id77" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>40<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  The understanding consisting in insight with the characteristics as its object that occurs as the abandoning of the perception of permanence, etc., in those same states is called <em>full-understanding as abandoning</em>.</p>
<p id="xx-4"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-4"><span class="std std-ref">§4</span></a> Herein, the plane of <em>full-understanding as the known</em> extends from the delimitation of formations (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-18.xhtml#xviii"><span class="std std-ref">Ch. XVIII</span></a>) up to the discernment of conditions (Ch. XIX); for in this interval the penetration of the specific characteristics of states predominates. The plane of <em>full-understanding as investigation</em> extends from comprehension by groups up to contemplation of rise and fall (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-21.xhtml#xxi-3"><span class="std std-ref">XXI.3f.</span></a>); for in this interval the penetration of the general characteristics predominates. The plane of <em>full-understanding as abandoning</em> extends from contemplation of dissolution onwards (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-21.xhtml#xxi-10"><span class="std std-ref">XXI.10</span></a>); for from there onwards the seven contemplations that effect the abandoning of the perception of permanence, etc., predominate thus:</p>
<p>(1) Contemplating [formations] as impermanent, a man abandons the perception of permanence.</p>
<p>(2) Contemplating [them] as painful, he abandons the perception of pleasure.</p>
<p>(3) Contemplating [them] as not-self, he abandons the perception of self.</p>
<p>(4) Becoming dispassionate, he abandons delighting.</p>
<p>(5) Causing fading away, he abandons greed.</p>
<p>(6) Causing cessation, he abandons originating.</p>
<p>(7) Relinquishing, he abandons grasping ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id4"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 58</em> ). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id79" id="id5" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>41<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="xx-5"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-5"><span class="std std-ref">§5</span></a> <em>[633/691]</em> So, of these three kinds of full-understanding, only full-understanding as the known has been attained by this meditator as yet, which is because the delimitation of formations and the discernment of conditions have already been accomplished; the other two still remain to be attained. Hence it was said above: “Besides, knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path arises when full-understanding as investigation is occurring, and full-understanding as investigation comes next to full-understanding as the known. So this is also a reason why one who desires to accomplish this purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path should first of all apply himself to comprehension by groups” (<a class="reference internal" href="#xx-2"><span class="std std-ref">§2</span></a>).</p>

<p id="xx-10"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-10"><span class="std std-ref">§10</span></a> For this is said in the Paṭisambhidā in the description of what is to be directly known: “Bhikkhus, all is to be directly known. And what is all that is to be directly known?  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">609</span></code>  (1) Eye is to be directly known; visible objects are to be directly known; eye-consciousness … eye-contact … feeling, pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, that arises due to eye-contact is also to be directly known.

But what is thus abbreviated includes the supramundane states. These should not be dealt with at this stage because they are not amenable to comprehension. And as regards those that are amenable to comprehension a beginning should be made by comprehending those among them that are obvious to and easily discernible by the individual [meditator].</p>

<section id="comprehension-by-groupsapplication-of-text">
<h3>2.2 Comprehension by Groups—Application of Text</h3>
<p id="xx-13"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-13"><span class="std std-ref">§13</span></a> Here is the application of the directions dealing with the aggregates: “Any materiality whatever, (i–iii) whether past, future, or present, (iv–v) internal or <em>[636/694]</em> external, (vi–vii) gross or subtle, (viii–ix) inferior or superior, (x-xi) far or near—he defines all materiality as impermanent: this is one kind of comprehension. He defines it as painful:  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">610</span></code>  this is one kind of comprehension. He defines it as not-self: this is one kind of comprehension” (see <a class="reference internal" href="#xx-6"><span class="std std-ref">§6</span></a>). At this point this bhikkhu [takes] all materiality, which is described without specifying as “<em>any materiality whatever</em>,” and having delimited it in the eleven instances, namely, with the past triad and with the four dyads beginning with the internal dyad, he “<em>defines all materiality as impermanent</em>,” he comprehends that it is impermanent. How? In the way stated next. For this is said: “<em>Materiality, whether past, future or present, is impermanent in the sense of destruction</em>.”</p>
<p id="xx-14"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-14"><span class="std std-ref">§14</span></a> Accordingly, he comprehends the materiality that is past as “<em>impermanent in the sense of destruction”</em> because it was destroyed in the past and did not reach this becoming; and he comprehends the materiality that is future as “<em>impermanent in the sense of destruction”</em> since it will be produced in the next becoming, will be destroyed there too, and will not pass on to a further becoming; and he comprehends the materiality that is present as “<em>impermanent in the sense of destruction”</em> since it is destroyed here and does not pass beyond. And he comprehends the materiality that is internal as “<em>impermanent in the sense of destruction</em>” since it is destroyed as internal and does not pass on to the external state. And he comprehends the materiality that is external … gross … subtle … inferior … superior … far … And he comprehends the materiality that is near as “<em>impermanent in the sense of destruction</em>” since it is destroyed there and does not pass on to the far state. And all this is impermanent in the sense of destruction. Accordingly, there is “<em>one kind of comprehension”</em> in this way; but it is effected in eleven ways.</p>
<p id="xx-15"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-15"><span class="std std-ref">§15</span></a> And all that [materiality] is “<em>painful in the sense of terror</em>.” In the sense of terror because of its terrifyingness; for what is impermanent brings terror, as it does to the deities in the Sīhopama Sutta ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id8"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>III 84</em> ). So this is also painful in the sense of terror. Accordingly, there is one kind of comprehension in this way too; but it is effected in eleven ways.</p>
<p id="xx-16"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-16"><span class="std std-ref">§16</span></a> And just as it is painful, so too all that [materiality] is “<em>not-self in the sense of having no core</em>.” In the sense of having no core because of the absence of any core of self conceived as a self, an abider, a doer, an experiencer, one who is his own master; for what is impermanent is painful ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id9"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>III 82</em> ), and it is impossible to escape the impermanence, or the rise and fall and oppression, of self, so how could it have the state of a doer, and so on? Hence it is said, “Bhikkhus, were materiality self, it would not lead to affliction” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id10"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>III 66</em> ), and so on. So this is also not-self in the sense of having no core. Accordingly, there is one kind of comprehension in this way too, but it is effected in eleven ways.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">611</span></code>  The same method applies to feeling, and so on.</p>
<p id="xx-17"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-17"><span class="std std-ref">§17</span></a> But what is impermanent is necessarily classed as formed, etc., and so in order to show the synonyms for that [impermanence], or in order to show how the attention given to it occurs in different ways, it is restated in the text thus: “Materiality, whether past, future, or present, is impermanent, formed, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, subject to fall, subject to fading away, subject to cessation” (<a class="reference internal" href="#xx-7"><span class="std std-ref">§7</span></a>). The same method applies to feeling, and so on.</p>

<section id="strengthening-of-comprehension-in-forty-ways">
<h3>2.3 Strengthening of Comprehension in Forty Ways</h3>
<p id="xx-18"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-18"><span class="std std-ref">§18</span></a> <em>[637/695]</em> Now, when the Blessed One was expounding conformity knowledge, he [asked the question]: “By means of what forty aspects does he acquire liking that is in conformity? By means of what forty aspects does he enter into the certainty of rightness?” (P‘8). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id81" id="id11" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>42<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  In the answer to it comprehension of impermanence, etc., is set forth by him analytically in the way beginning: “[Seeing] the five aggregates as impermanent, as painful, as a disease, a boil, a dart, a calamity, an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as a plague, a disaster, a terror, a menace, as fickle, perishable, unenduring, as no protection, no shelter, no refuge, as empty, vain, void, not-self, as a danger, as subject to change, as having no core, as the root of calamity, as murderous, as due to be annihilated, as subject to cankers, as formed, as Māra’s bait, as subject to birth, subject to ageing, subject to illness, subject to death, subject to sorrow, subject to lamentation, subject to despair, subject to defilement. Seeing the five aggregates as impermanent, he acquires liking that is in conformity. And seeing that the cessation of the five aggregates is the permanent Nibbāna, he enters into the certainty of rightness” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id12"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>II 238</em> ). So in order to strengthen that same comprehension of impermanence, pain, and not-self in the five aggregates, this [meditator] also comprehends these five aggregates by means of that [kind of comprehension].</p>
<p id="xx-19"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-19"><span class="std std-ref">§19</span></a> How does he do it? He does it by means of comprehension as impermanent, etc., stated specifically as follows: He comprehends each aggregate as <em>impermanent</em> because of non-endlessness, and because of possession of a beginning and an end; as <em>painful</em> because of oppression by rise and fall, and because of being the basis for pain; as <em>a disease</em> because of having to be maintained by conditions, and because of being the root of disease; as <em>a boil</em> because of being consequent upon impalement by suffering, because of oozing with the filth of defilements, and because of being swollen by arising, ripened by ageing, and burst by dissolution; as <em>a dart</em> because of producing oppression, because of penetrating inside, and because of being hard to extract; as <em>a calamity</em> because of having to be condemned, because of bringing loss, and  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">612</span></code>  because of being the basis for calamity; as <em>an affliction</em> because of restricting freedom, and because of being the foundation for affliction; as <em>alien</em> because of inability to have mastery exercised over them, and because of intractability; as <em>disintegrating</em> because of crumbling through sickness, ageing and death; as <em>a plague</em> because of bringing various kinds of ruin; as <em>a disaster</em> because of bringing unforeseen and plentiful adversity, and because of being the basis for all kinds of terror, and because of being the opposite of the supreme comfort called the stilling of all suffering; as a <em>menace</em> because of being bound up with many kinds of adversity, because of being menaced <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id83" id="id13" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>43<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  by ills, and because of unfitness, as a menace, to be entertained; as <em>fickle</em> because of fickle <em>[638/696]</em> insecurity due to sickness, ageing and death, and to the worldly states of gain, etc.; <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id84" id="id14" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>44<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  as <em>perishable</em> because of having the nature of perishing both by violence and naturally; as <em>unenduring</em> because of collapsing on every occasion <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id86" id="id15" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>45<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  and because of lack of solidity; <em>as no protection</em> because of not protecting, and because of affording no safety; <em>as no shelter</em> because of unfitness to give shelter, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id87" id="id16" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>46<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  and because of not performing the function of a shelter for the unsheltered; <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id88" id="id17" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>47<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  as <em>no refuge</em> because of failure to disperse fear <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id89" id="id18" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>48<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  in those who depend on them; as <em>empty</em> because of their emptiness of the lastingness, beauty, pleasure and self that are conceived about them; as <em>vain</em> because of their emptiness, or because of their triviality; for what is trivial is called “vain” in the world; as <em>void</em> because devoid of the state of being an owner, abider, doer, experiencer, director; as <em>not-self</em> because of itself having no owner, etc.; as <em>danger</em> because of the suffering in the process of becoming, and because of the danger in suffering or, alternatively, as <em>danger</em> (<em>ādīnava</em>) because of resemblance to misery (<em>ādīna</em>) <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id91" id="id19" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>49<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  since “danger” (<em>ādīnava</em>) means that it is towards misery (<em>ādīna</em>) that it moves (<em>vāti</em>), goes, advances, this being a term for a wretched man, and the aggregates are wretched too; as <em>subject to change</em> because of having the nature of change in two ways, that is, through ageing and through death; as <em>having no core</em> because of feebleness, and because of decaying soon like sapwood; as <em>the root of calamity</em> because of being the cause of calamity; as <em>murderous</em> because of breaking faith like an enemy posing as a friend; as <em>due to be annihilated</em> because their becoming disappears, and because their non-becoming comes about; as <em>subject to cankers</em> because of being the proximate cause for cankers; as <em>formed</em> because of being formed by causes and conditions; as <em>Māra’s bait</em> because of being the bait [laid] by the Māra of death and the Māra of defilement; as <em>subject to birth, to ageing, to illness,</em> and <em>to death</em> because of having birth, ageing, illness and death as their nature; <em>as subject to sorrow, to lamentation</em> and <em>to despair</em> because of being the cause of sorrow, lamentation and despair; as <em>subject to defilement</em> because of being the objective field of the defilements of craving, views and misconduct.</p>
<p id="xx-20"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-20"><span class="std std-ref">§20</span></a> Now, there are  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">613</span></code>  fifty kinds of contemplation of impermanence here by taking the following ten in the case of each aggregate: as impermanent, as disintegrating, as fickle, as perishable, as unenduring, as subject to change, as having no core, as due to be annihilated, as formed, as subject to death. There are twenty-five kinds of contemplation of not-self by taking the following five in the case of each aggregate: as alien, as empty, as vain, as void, as not-self. There are <em>[639/697]</em> one hundred and twenty-five kinds of contemplation of pain by taking the rest beginning with “as painful, as a disease” in the case of each aggregate.</p>
<p>So when a man comprehends the five aggregates by means of this comprehending as impermanent, etc., in its two hundred aspects, his comprehending as impermanent, painful and not-self, which is called “inductive insight,” is strengthened. These in the first place are the directions for undertaking comprehension here in accordance with the method given in the texts.</p>

<h3>2.5 Comprehension of the Material</h3>
<p id="xx-22"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-22"><span class="std std-ref">§22</span></a> While comprehending materiality he should see how materiality is generated, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id94" id="id21" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>51<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  that is to say, how this materiality is generated by the four causes beginning with kamma. Herein, when materiality is being generated in any being, it is first generated from kamma. For at the actual moment of rebirth-linking of a child in the womb, first thirty instances of materiality are generated in the triple continuity, in other words, the decads of physical [heart-]basis, body, and sex. And those are generated at the actual instant of the rebirth-linking consciousness’s arising. And as at the instant of its arising, so too at the instant of its presence and at the instant of its dissolution. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id96" id="id22" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>52<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="xx-23"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-23"><span class="std std-ref">§23</span></a> Herein, the cessation of materiality is slow and its transformation ponderous, while the cessation of consciousness is swift and its transformation quick (light); hence it is said, “Bhikkhus, I see no other one thing that is so quickly transformed as  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">614</span></code>  the mind” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id23"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>I 10</em> ).</p>
<p id="xx-24"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-24"><span class="std std-ref">§24</span></a> For the life-continuum consciousness arises and ceases sixteen times while one material instant endures. With consciousness the instant of arising, instant <em>[640/698]</em> of presence, and instant of dissolution are equal; but with materiality only the instants of arising and dissolution are quick like those [of consciousness], while the instant of its presence is long and lasts while sixteen consciousnesses arise and cease.</p>
<p id="xx-25"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-25"><span class="std std-ref">§25</span></a> The second life-continuum arises with the prenascent physical [heart-]basis as its support, which has already reached presence and arose at the rebirth-linking consciousness’s instant of arising. The third life-continuum arises with the prenascent physical basis as its support, which has already reached presence and arose together with that [second life-continuum consciousness]. The occurrence of consciousness can be understood to happen in this way throughout life. But in one who is facing death sixteen consciousnesses arise with a single prenascent physical [heart-]basis as their support, which has already reached presence.</p>
<p id="xx-26"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-26"><span class="std std-ref">§26</span></a> The materiality that arose at the instant of arising of the rebirth-linking consciousness ceases along with the sixteenth consciousness after the rebirth-linking consciousness. That arisen at the instant of presence of the rebirth-linking consciousness ceases together with the instant of arising of the seventeenth. That arisen at the instant of its dissolution ceases on arriving at the instant of presence of the seventeenth. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id98" id="id24" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>53<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  It goes on occurring thus for as long as the recurrence [of births] continues.</p>

And those herein that do give rise to materiality do not do so at the instant of their presence or at the instant of their dissolution, for consciousness is weak then.

<h3>2.6 Comprehension of the Immaterial</h3>
<p id="xx-43"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-43"><span class="std std-ref">§43</span></a> And just as one who is comprehending the material should see the generation of the material, so too one who is comprehending the immaterial should see the generation of the immaterial. And that is through the eighty-one mundane arisings of consciousness, that is to say, it is by kamma accumulated in a previous becoming that this immaterial [mentality] is generated. And in the first place it is generated as [one of] the nineteen kinds of arisings of consciousness as rebirth-linking (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-17.xhtml#xvii-130"><span class="std std-ref">XVII.130</span></a>). But the modes in which it is generated should be understood according to the method given in the Description of the Dependent Origination (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-17.xhtml#xvii-134"><span class="std std-ref">XVII.134f.</span></a>). That same [nineteenfold arising of consciousness is generated] as life-continuum as well, starting from the consciousness next to rebirth-linking consciousness, and as death consciousness at the termination of the life span. And when it is of the sense sphere, and the object in the six doors is a vivid one, it is also generated as registration.</p>
<p id="xx-44"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-44"><span class="std std-ref">§44</span></a> In the course of an existence, eye-consciousness, together with its associated states, supported by light and caused by attention is generated because the eye is intact and because visible data have come into focus. For it is actually when a visible datum has reached presence that it impinges on the eye at the instant of the eye-sensitivity’s presence. When it has done so, the life-continuum arises and ceases twice. Next to arise is the functional mind element with that same object, accomplishing the function of adverting. Next to that, eye-consciousness, which is the result of profitable or of unprofitable [kamma] and sees that same visible datum.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">618</span></code>  Next, the resultant mind element, which receives that same visible datum. Next, the resultant root-causeless mind-consciousness element, which investigates that same visible datum. Next, the functional mind-consciousness element without root-cause and accompanied by equanimity, which determines that same visible datum. Next, [it is generated either] as one from among the profitable ((l)–(8)), unprofitable ((22)–(33)), or functional ((71) and (73)–(80)) kinds of consciousness belonging to the sense sphere, either as consciousness accompanied by equanimity and without root-cause (71), <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id106" id="id30" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>57<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  or as five or seven impulsions. Next, in the case of sense-sphere beings, [it is generated] as any of the eleven kinds of registration consciousness conforming [as to object] with the impulsions. The same applies to the remaining doors. But in the case of the mind door-exalted consciousnesses also arise.</p>
<p>This is how the generation of the immaterial should be seen in the case of the six doors.</p>
<p><em>[645/703]</em> One who sees the generation of the immaterial thus is said to “comprehend the immaterial at another time” (<a class="reference internal" href="#xx-21"><span class="std std-ref">§21</span></a>).</p>
<p id="xx-45"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-45"><span class="std std-ref">§45</span></a> This is how one [meditator] accomplishes the development of understanding, progressing gradually by comprehending at one time the material and at another time the immaterial, by attributing the three characteristics to them.</p>

<h3>2.7 The Material Septad</h3>

<p id="xx-46"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-46"><span class="std std-ref">§46</span></a> Herein, one who comprehends [them] by attributing [the characteristics] in the following seven ways is said to comprehend by attributing through the medium of the material septad, that is to say, (1) as taking up and putting down, (2) as disappearance of what grows old in each stage, (3) as arising from nutriment, (4) as arising from temperature, (5) as kamma-born, (6) as consciousness-originated, and (7) as natural materiality. Hence the Ancients said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“(1) As taking up and putting down,</div>
<div class="line">(2) As growth and decline in every stage,</div>
<div class="line">(3) As nutriment, (4) as temperature,</div>

<p id="xx-47"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-47"><span class="std std-ref">§47</span></a> <em>1.</em> Herein, <em>taking up</em> is rebirth-linking. <em>Putting down</em> is death. So the meditator allots one hundred years for this “taking up” and “putting down” and he attributes the three characteristics to formations. How? All formations between these limits are impermanent. Why? Because of the occurrence of rise and fall, because of change, because of temporariness, and because of preclusion of permanence. But since arisen formations have arrived at presence, and when present are afflicted by ageing, and on arriving at ageing are bound to dissolve, they are therefore painful because of continual oppression, because of being hard to bear, because of being the basis of suffering, and because of precluding pleasure. And since no one has any power over arisen formations in the three instances, “Let them not reach presence”, “Let those that have reached presence not age,” and “Let those that have reached ageing not dissolve,” and they are void of the possibility of any power being exercised over them, they are therefore not-self because void, because ownerless, because unsusceptible to the wielding of power, and because of precluding a self. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id108" id="id31" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>58<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>   <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">619</span></code></p>

(a)</em> Having attributed the three characteristics to materiality allotted one hundred years for the “taking up” and “putting down” thus, he next attributes them according to <em>disappearance of what grows old in each stage.</em> Herein, “disappearance of what grows old in each stage” is a name for the disappearance of the materiality that has grown old during a stage [of life]. The meaning is that he attributes the three characteristics by means of that.</p>
<p id="xx-49"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-49"><span class="std std-ref">§49</span></a> How? He divides that same hundred years up into three stages, that is, the first stage, the middle stage, and the last stage. Herein, the first thirty-three years are called the first stage, the next thirty-four years are called the middle stage, and the next thirty-three years are called the last stage. So after dividing it up into these three stages, [he attributes the three characteristics thus:] The materiality occurring in the first stage ceased there without reaching the middle stage: therefore it is impermanent; what is impermanent is painful; what is painful is not-self. Also the materiality occurring in the middle stage ceased there without reaching the last stage: therefore it is impermanent too and painful and not-self. Also there is no materiality occurring in the thirty-three years of the last stage that is capable of out-lasting death: therefore that is impermanent too and painful and not-self. This is how he attributes the three characteristics.</p>
<p id="xx-50"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-50"><span class="std std-ref">§50</span></a> <em>2. (b)</em> Having attributed the three characteristics according to “disappearance of what grows old in each stage” thus by means of the first stage, etc., he again attributes the three characteristics according to “disappearance of what grows old in each stage” by means of the following ten decades: the tender decade, the sport decade, the beauty decade, the strength decade, the understanding decade, the decline decade, the stooping decade, the bent decade, the dotage decade, and the prone decade.</p>
<p id="xx-51"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-51"><span class="std std-ref">§51</span></a> Herein, as to these decades: in the first place, the first ten years of a person with a hundred years’ life are called the <em>tender decade</em>; for then he is a tender unsteady child. The next ten years are called the <em>sport decade</em>; for he is very fond of sport then. The next ten years are called the <em>beauty decade</em>; for his beauty reaches its full extent then. The next ten years are called the <em>strength decade</em>; for his strength and power reach their full extent then. The next ten years are called the <em>understanding decade</em>; for his understanding is well established by then. Even in one naturally weak in understanding some understanding, it seems, arises at that time. The next ten years are called the <em>decline decade</em>; for his fondness for sport and his beauty, strength, and understanding decline then. The next ten years are called the <em>stooping decade</em>; for his figure  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">620</span></code>  stoops forward then. The next ten years are called the <em>bent decade</em>; for his figure becomes bent like the end of a plough then. The next ten years are called the <em>dotage decade</em>; for he is doting then and forgets what he does. The next ten years are called the <em>prone decade</em>; for a centenarian mostly lies prone.</p>
<p id="xx-52"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-52"><span class="std std-ref">§52</span></a> Herein, in order to attribute the three characteristics according to “disappearance of what grows old in each stage” by means of these decades, the meditator considers thus: The materiality occurring in the first decade ceases there without reaching the second decade: therefore it is impermanent, painful, not-self. The materiality occurring in the second decade … the materiality <em>[647/705]</em> occurring in the ninth decade ceases there without reaching the tenth decade; the materiality occurring in the tenth decade ceases there without reaching the next becoming: therefore it is impermanent, painful, not-self.

<p id="xx-54"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-54"><span class="std std-ref">§54</span></a> How? He considers thus: The materiality occurring in the first five years ceases there without reaching the second five years: therefore it is impermanent, painful, not-self. The materiality occurring in the second five years … in the third … in the nineteenth five years ceases there without reaching the twentieth five years.

The materiality occurring in the autumn … in the winter (<em>hemanta</em>) … in the cool (<em>sisira</em>) … in the spring (<em>vasanta</em>) … the materiality occurring in the summer (<em>gimha</em>) ceases there without reaching the rains again: therefore it is impermanent too, painful, not-self.</p>

<p id="xx-63"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-63"><span class="std std-ref">§63</span></a> Herein, <em>lifting up</em> is raising the foot from the ground. <em>Shifting forward</em> is shifting it to the front. <em>Shifting sideways</em> is moving the foot to one side or the other in seeing a thorn, stump, snake, and so on. <em>Lowering down</em> is letting the foot down.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">622</span></code>  <em>Placing down</em> is putting the foot on the ground. <em>Fixing down</em> is pressing the foot on the ground while the other foot is being lifted up.</p>

He considers thus: The elements and the kinds of derived materiality occurring in the lifting up all ceased there without reaching the shifting forward: therefore they are impermanent, painful, not-self. Likewise those occurring in <em>[649/707]</em> the shifting forward … the shifting sideways; those occurring in the shifting sideways … the lowering down; those occurring in the lowering down … the placing down; those occurring in the placing down cease there without reaching the fixing down; thus formations keep breaking up, like crackling sesame seeds put into a hot pan; wherever they arise, there they cease stage by stage, section by section, term by term, each without reaching the next part: therefore they are impermanent, painful, not-self.</p>
<p id="xx-66"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-66"><span class="std std-ref">§66</span></a> When he sees formations stage by stage with insight thus, his comprehension of materiality has become subtle. Here is a simile for its subtlety. A border dweller, it seems, who was familiar with torches of wood and grass, etc., but had never seen a lamp before, came to a city. Seeing a lamp burning in the market, he asked a man, “I say, what is that lovely thing called?”—“What is lovely about that? It is called a lamp. Where it goes to when its oil and wick are used up no one knows.” Another told him, “That is crudely put; for the flame in each third portion of the wick as it gradually burns up ceases there without reaching the other parts.” Other told him, “That is crudely put too; for the flame in each inch, in each half-inch, in each thread, in each strand, will cease without reaching the other strands; but the flame cannot appear without a strand.”</p>
<p id="xx-67"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-67"><span class="std std-ref">§67</span></a>  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">623</span></code>  Herein, the meditator’s attribution of the three characteristics to materiality delimited by the hundred years as “taking up” and “putting down” is like the man’s knowledge stated thus, “Where it goes when its oil and wick are used up no one knows.” The meditator’s attribution of the three characteristics according to “disappearance of what grows old in each stage” to the materiality delimited by the third part of the hundred years is like the man’s knowledge stated thus, “The flame in each third portion of the wick ceases without reaching the other parts.” The meditator’s attribution of the three characteristics to materiality delimited by the periods of ten, five, four, three, two years, one year, is like the man’s knowledge stated thus, “The flame in each inch will cease without reaching the others.” The meditator’s attribution of the three characteristics to materiality delimited by the four-month and two-month periods by classing the year as threefold and sixfold respectively according to the seasons is like the man’s knowledge stated thus, “The flame in each half-inch will cease without reaching the others.” The meditator’s attribution of the three characteristics to materiality delimited by means of the dark and bright halves of the moon, by means of night and day, and by means of morning, etc., taking one night and day in six parts, is like the man’s knowledge stated thus, “The flame in each thread will cease without reaching the others.” The meditator’s attribution of the three characteristics to materiality delimited by means of each part, namely, “moving forward,” etc., and “lifting up,” etc., is like the man’s knowledge stated thus, “The flame in each strand will cease without reaching the others.”</p>
<p id="xx-68"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-68"><span class="std std-ref">§68</span></a> <em>3–6.</em> Having in various ways thus attributed the three characteristics to materiality according to “disappearance of what grows old in each stage,” he analyzes that same materiality and divides it into four portions as “arising from nutriment,” etc., and he again attributes the three characteristics to each portion. <em>[650/708]</em> <em>3.</em> Herein, materiality <em>arising from nutriment</em> becomes evident to him through hunger and its satisfaction. For materiality that is originated when one is hungry is parched and stale, and it is as ugly and disfigured as a parched stump, as a crow perching in a charcoal pit. That originated when hunger is satisfied is plump, fresh, tender, smooth and soft to touch. Discerning that, he attributes the three characteristics to it thus: The materiality occurring when hunger is satisfied ceases there without reaching the time when one is hungry; therefore it is impermanent, painful, not-self.</p>
<p id="xx-69"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-69"><span class="std std-ref">§69</span></a> <em>4.</em> That <em>arising from temperature</em> becomes evident through cool and heat. For materiality that is originated when it is hot is parched, stale and ugly.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">624</span></code>  Materiality originated by cool temperature is plump, fresh, tender, smooth, and soft to touch. Discerning that, he attributes the three characteristics to it thus: The materiality occurring when it is hot ceases there without reaching the time when it is cool. The materiality occurring when it is cool ceases there without reaching the time when it is hot: therefore it is impermanent, painful, not-self.</p>
<p id="xx-70"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-70"><span class="std std-ref">§70</span></a> <em>5. The kamma-born</em> becomes evident through the sense doors, that is, the base [of consciousness]. For in the case of the eye door there are thirty material instances with decads of the eye, the body, and sex; but with the twenty-four instances originated by temperature, consciousness, and nutriment, [that is to say, three bare octads,] which are their support, there are fifty-four. Likewise in the case of the doors of the ear, nose, and tongue. In the case of the body door there are forty-four with the decads of body and sex and the instances originated by temperature, and so on. In the case of the mind door there are fifty-four, too, with the decads of the heart-basis, the body, and sex, and those instances originated by the temperature, and so on. Discerning all that materiality, he attributes the three characteristics to it thus: The materiality occurring in the eye door ceases there without reaching the ear door; the materiality occurring in the ear door … the nose door; the materiality occurring in the nose door … the tongue door; the materiality occurring in the tongue door … the body door; the materiality occurring in the body door ceases there without reaching the mind door: therefore it is impermanent, painful, not-self.</p>
<p id="xx-71"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-71"><span class="std std-ref">§71</span></a> <em>6.</em> The consciousness-originated becomes evident through [the behaviour of] one who is joyful or grieved. For the materiality arisen at the time when he is joyful is smooth, tender, fresh and soft to touch. That arisen at the time when he is grieved is parched, stale and ugly. Discerning that, he attributes the three characteristics to it thus: The materiality occurring at the time when one is joyful ceases there without reaching the time when one is grieved; the materiality occurring at the time when one is grieved ceases there without reaching the time when one is joyful: therefore it is impermanent, painful, not-self.</p>
<p id="xx-72"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-72"><span class="std std-ref">§72</span></a> When he discerns consciousness-originated materiality and attributes the three characteristics to it in this way, this meaning becomes evident to him:</p>

After it has become the colour of dark green leaves, as it follows out the successive stages of such material continuity, it eventually becomes withered foliage, and at the end of the year it breaks loose from its stem and falls off.</p>
<p id="xx-75"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-75"><span class="std std-ref">§75</span></a> Discerning that, he attributes the three characteristics to it thus: The materiality occurring when it is pale pink ceases there without reaching the time when it is dense red; the materiality occurring when it is dense red … dull red; the materiality occurring when it is dull red … the colour of a tender [mango] shoot; the materiality occurring when it is the colour of a tender [mango] shoot … the colour of a growing shoot; the materiality occurring when it is the colour of a growing shoot … the colour of pale green leaves; the materiality occurring <em>[652/710]</em> when it is the colour of pale green leaves … the colour of dark green leaves; the materiality occurring when it is the colour of dark green leaves … the time when it is withered foliage; the materiality occurring when it is withered foliage ceases there without  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">626</span></code>  reaching the time when it breaks loose from its stem and falls off: therefore it is impermanent, painful, not-self.</p>
<p>He comprehends all natural materiality in this way.</p>

<h3>2.8 The Immaterial Septad</h3>
<p id="xx-76"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-76"><span class="std std-ref">§76</span></a> The headings of what was called above “the immaterial septad” are these: (1) by groups, (2) by pairs, (3) by moments, (4) by series, (5) by removal of [false] view, (6) by abolition of conceit, (7) by ending of attachment.</p>
<p id="xx-77"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-77"><span class="std std-ref">§77</span></a> <em>1.</em> Herein, <em>by groups</em> means the states belonging to the contact pentad. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id118" id="id38" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>62<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  How? Here, “he comprehends by groups” [means that] a bhikkhu considers thus: The states belonging to the contact pentad arising in the comprehending of head hairs as “impermanent, painful, not-self”; the states belonging to the contact pentad arising in the comprehending of body hairs as … in the contemplation of brain as “impermanent, painful, not-self”—all these states disintegrate section by section, term by term, like crackling sesame seeds put into a hot pan, each without reaching the next: therefore they are impermanent, painful, not-self. This, firstly, is the method according to the Discourse on Purification. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id120" id="id39" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>63<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="xx-78"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-78"><span class="std std-ref">§78</span></a> According to the Discourse on the Noble Ones’ Heritages, however, he is said to “comprehend by groups” when by means of a subsequent consciousness he comprehends as “impermanent, painful, not-self” that consciousness which occurred [comprehending] materiality as “impermanent, painful, not-self” in the seven instances of the material septad given above. As this method is more suitable we shall therefore confine ourselves to it in explaining the rest.</p>
<p id="xx-79"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-79"><span class="std std-ref">§79</span></a> <em>2. By pairs:</em> after the bhikkhu has comprehended as “impermanent, painful, not-self” the materiality of the “taking up and putting down” (<a class="reference internal" href="#xx-46"><span class="std std-ref">§46f.</span></a>), he comprehends that consciousness [with which he was comprehending the materiality] too as “impermanent, painful, not-self” by means of a subsequent consciousness. After he has comprehended as “impermanent, painful, not-self” the materiality of the “disappearance of what grows old in each stage” and that “arising from nutriment,” “arising from temperature,” “kamma-born,” “consciousness-originated” and “natural,” he comprehends that consciousness too as “impermanent, painful, not-self” by means of a subsequent consciousness. In this way he is said to comprehend by pairs.</p>
<p id="xx-80"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-80"><span class="std std-ref">§80</span></a> <em>[653/711]</em> <em>3. By moments</em>: after the bhikkhu has comprehended as “impermanent, painful, not-self” the materiality of the “taking up and putting down,” he comprehends that first consciousness [with which he was comprehending the materiality] as “impermanent, painful, not-self” by means of a second consciousness, and that second consciousness by means of a third, and the third by means of a fourth, and the fourth by means of a fifth, and that too he comprehends as “impermanent, painful, not-self.” After he has comprehended as “impermanent, painful, not-self” the materiality of “disappearance of what grows old in each stage” and that “arising from nutriment,” “arising from temperature,”  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">627</span></code>  “kamma-born,” “consciousness-originated” and “natural,” he comprehends that first consciousness as “impermanent, painful, not-self” by means of a second consciousness, and that second consciousness by means of a third, and the third by means of a fourth, and the fourth by means of a fifth, and that too he comprehends as “impermanent, painful, not-self.” Comprehending thus four [consciousnesses] from each discerning of materiality he is said to comprehend by moments.</p>
<p id="xx-81"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-81"><span class="std std-ref">§81</span></a> <em>4. By series</em>: after he has comprehended as “impermanent, painful, not-self” the materiality of the “taking up and putting down,” he comprehends that first consciousness as “impermanent, painful, not-self” by means of a second consciousness, and the second by means of a third, and the third by means of a fourth … and the tenth by means of an eleventh, and that too he comprehends as “impermanent, painful, not-self.” After he has comprehended as “impermanent, painful, not-self” the materiality of the “disappearance of what grows old in each stage” and that “arising from nutriment,” “arising from temperature,” “kamma-born,” “consciousness-originated” and “natural,” he comprehends that consciousness as “impermanent, painful, not-self” by means of a second consciousness, and the second by means of a third, … and the tenth by means of an eleventh, and that too he comprehends as “impermanent, painful, not-self.” It would be possible to go on comprehending it in this way with serial insight even for a whole day. But both the material meditation subject and the immaterial meditation subject become familiar when the comprehending is taken as far as the tenth consciousness. That is why it is said <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id121" id="id40" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>64<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  that it can be stopped at the tenth. It is when he comprehends in this way that he is said to comprehend by series.</p>
<p id="xx-82"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-82"><span class="std std-ref">§82</span></a> <em>5. By removal of [false] view,</em> 6*. by abolition of conceit,* 7. <em>by ending of attachment</em>: there is no individual method for any of these three. But when he has discerned this materiality as described above and this immateriality as described here, then he sees that there is no living being over and above the material and the immaterial. As soon as he no longer sees a being, the perception of a being is removed. When he discerns formations with consciousness from which perception of a being has been removed, then [false] view does not arise in him. When [false] view does not arise in him, then [false] view is said to be removed.</p>
<p>When he discerns formations with consciousness from which [false] view has been removed, then conceit does not arise in him. When conceit does not <em>[654/712]</em> arise, conceit is said to be abolished. When he discerns formations with consciousness from which conceit has been abolished, then craving does not arise in him. When craving does not arise in him, attachment is said to be ended. This firstly is what is said in the Discourse on Purification.</p>
<p id="xx-83"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-83"><span class="std std-ref">§83</span></a> But in the Discourse on the Noble Ones’ Heritages, after setting forth the headings thus: “As removal of [false] view, as abolition of conceit, as ending of attachment,” the following method is set forth: “There is no removal of [false] view in one who takes it thus, ‘I see with insight, my insight’;  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">628</span></code>  there is removal of [false] view in one who takes it thus, ‘Only formations see formations with insight, comprehend, define, discern, and delimit them.’ There is no abolition of conceit in one who takes it thus, ‘I see thoroughly with insight, I see well with insight’; there is abolition of conceit in one who takes it thus, ‘Only formations see formations with insight, comprehend, define, discern, and delimit them.’ There is no ending of attachment in one who is pleased with insight thus, ‘I am able to see with insight’; there is ending of attachment in one who takes it thus, ‘Only formations see formations with insight, comprehend, define, discern, and delimit them.’</p>
<p id="xx-84"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-84"><span class="std std-ref">§84</span></a> “There is removal of [false] view in one who sees thus: ‘If formations were self, it would be right to take them as self; but being not-self they are taken as self. Therefore they are not-self in the sense of no power being exercisable over them; they are impermanent in the sense of non-existence after having come to be; they are painful in the sense of oppression by rise and fall.’</p>
<p id="xx-85"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-85"><span class="std std-ref">§85</span></a> “There is abolition of conceit in one who sees thus: ‘If formations were permanent, it would be right to take them as permanent; but being impermanent they are taken as permanent. Therefore they are impermanent in the sense of non-existence after having come to be; they are painful in the sense of oppression by rise and fall; they are not-self in the sense of no power being exercisable over them.’</p>
<p id="xx-86"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-86"><span class="std std-ref">§86</span></a> “There is ending of attachment in one who sees thus: ‘If formations were pleasant, it would be right to take them as pleasant; but being painful they are taken as pleasant. Therefore they are painful in the sense of oppression by rise and fall; they are impermanent in the sense of non-existence after having come to be; they are not-self in the sense of no power being exercisable over them.’</p>
<p id="xx-87"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-87"><span class="std std-ref">§87</span></a> “Thus there comes to be the removal of [false] view in one who sees formations as not-self; there comes to be the abolishing of conceit in one who sees them as impermanent; there comes to be the ending of attachment in one who sees them as painful. So this insight is valid in each instance.”</p>
<p id="xx-88"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-88"><span class="std std-ref">§88</span></a> This is how he comprehends formations by attributing the three characteristics to them by means of the immaterial septad.</p>

Now, as regards these: (1) One who develops the contemplation of impermanence abandons the perception of permanence, (2) one who develops the contemplation of pain  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">629</span></code>  abandons the perception of pleasure, (3) one who develops the contemplation of not-self abandons the perception of self, (4) one who develops the contemplation of dispassion abandons delighting, (5) one who develops the contemplation of fading away abandons greed, (6) one who develops the contemplation of cessation abandons origination, (7) one who develops the contemplation of relinquishment abandons grasping, (8) one who develops the contemplation of destruction abandons the perception of compactness, (9) one who develops the contemplation of fall [of formations] abandons accumulation [of kamma], (10) one who develops the contemplation of change abandons the perception of lastingness, (11) one who develops the contemplation of the signless abandons the sign, (12) one who develops the contemplation of the desireless abandons desire, (13) one who develops the contemplation of voidness abandons misinterpreting (insistence), (14) one who develops the insight into states that is higher understanding abandons misinterpreting (insistence) due to grasping at a core, (15) one who develops correct knowledge and vision abandons misinterpreting (insistence) due to confusion, (16) one who develops the contemplation of danger abandons misinterpreting (insistence) due to reliance, (17) one who develops the contemplation of reflection abandons non-reflection, (18) one who develops the contemplation of turning away abandons misinterpreting (insistence) due to bondage (see  <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id42"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 32f.</em> ). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id124" id="id43" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>66<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="xx-91"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-91"><span class="std std-ref">§91</span></a> <em>[656/714]</em> Now the meditator has seen formations by means of the three characteristics beginning with impermanence, and so he has therefore already penetrated among these eighteen insights the contemplations of impermanence, pain, and not-self. And then (1) the contemplation of impermanence and (11) the contemplation of the signless are one in meaning and different only in the letter, and so are (2) the contemplation of pain and (12) the contemplation of the desireless, and so are (3) the contemplation of not-self and (13) the contemplation of voidness (see  <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id44"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>II 63</em> ). Consequently these have been penetrated by him as well. But (14) insight into states that is higher understanding is all kinds of insight, and (15) correct knowledge and vision is included in purification by overcoming doubt (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-19.xhtml#xix"><span class="std std-ref">Ch.

<h3>2.10 Knowledge of Rise and Fall—I</h3>
<p id="xx-93"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-93"><span class="std std-ref">§93</span></a> Having purified his knowledge in this way by abandoning the perceptions of permanence, etc., which oppose the contemplations of impermanence, etc., he passes on from comprehension knowledge and begins the task of attaining that of contemplation of rise and fall, which is expressed thus: “Understanding  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">630</span></code>  of contemplating present states’ change is knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id46"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 1</em> ), and which comes next after comprehension knowledge.</p>
<p id="xx-94"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-94"><span class="std std-ref">§94</span></a> When he does so, he does it first in brief. Here is the text: “How is it that understanding of contemplating present states’ change is knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall? Present materiality is born [materiality]; the characteristic of its generation is rise, the characteristic of its change is fall, the contemplation is knowledge. Present feeling … perception … formations … consciousness … eye … (etc.) … Present becoming is born [becoming]; the characteristic of its generation is rise, the characteristic of its change is fall, the contemplation is knowledge” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id47"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 54</em> ). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id129" id="id48" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>68<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="xx-95"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-95"><span class="std std-ref">§95</span></a> In accordance with the method of this text he sees the characteristic of generation, the birth, the arising, the aspect of renewal, of born materiality, as “rise,” and he sees its characteristic of change, its destruction, its dissolution, as “fall.”</p>
<p id="xx-96"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-96"><span class="std std-ref">§96</span></a> <em>[658/716]</em> He understands thus: “There is no heap or store of unarisen mentality-materiality [existing] prior to its arising. When it arises, it does not come from any heap or store; and when it ceases, it does not go in any direction. There is nowhere any depository in the way of a heap or store or hoard of what has ceased. But just as there is no store, prior to its arising, of the sound that arises when a lute is played, nor does it come from any store when it arises, nor does it go in any direction when it ceases, nor does it persist as a store when it has ceased (cf.  <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id49"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>IV 197</em> ), but on the contrary, not having been, it is brought into being owing to the lute, the lute’s neck, and the man’s appropriate effort, and having been, it vanishes—so too all material and immaterial states, not having been, are brought into being, and having been, they vanish.”</p>
<p id="xx-97"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-97"><span class="std std-ref">§97</span></a> Having given attention to rise and fall in brief thus, he again [does so in detail according to condition and instant by seeing those characteristics] as given in the exposition of that same knowledge of rise and fall thus: “(1) He sees the rise of the materiality aggregate in the sense of conditioned arising thus: With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of materiality; (2) … with the arising of craving … (3) … with the arising of kamma … (4) he sees the rise of the materiality aggregate in the sense of conditioned arising thus: With the arising of nutriment there is the arising of materiality; (5) one who sees the characteristic of generation sees the rise of the materiality aggregate. One who sees the rise of the materiality aggregate sees these five characteristics.</p>
<p>“(1) He sees the fall of the materiality aggregate in the sense of conditioned cessation thus: With the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of materiality; (2) … with the cessation of craving … (3) … with the cessation of kamma … (4) he sees the fall of the materiality aggregate in the sense of conditioned cessation thus: With the cessation of nutriment there is the cessation of materiality;  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">631</span></code>  (5) one who sees the characteristic of change sees the fall of the materiality aggregate. One who sees the fall of the materiality aggregate sees these five characteristics” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id50"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 55f.</em> ).</p>
<p>Likewise: “(1) He sees the rise of the feeling aggregate in the sense of conditioned arising thus: With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of feeling; (2) … with the arising of craving … (3) … with the arising of kamma … (4) he sees the rise of the feeling aggregate in the sense of conditioned arising thus: With the arising of contact there is the arising of feeling; (5) one who sees the characteristic of generation sees the rise of the feeling aggregate. One who sees the rise of the feeling aggregate sees those five characteristics.</p>
<p>“(1) He sees the fall of the feeling aggregate in the sense of conditioned cessation thus: With the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of feeling; (2) … with the cessation of craving … (3) … with the cessation of kamma … (4) he sees the fall of the feeling aggregate in the sense of conditioned cessation thus: With the cessation of contact there is the cessation of feeling; (5) one who sees the characteristic of change sees the fall of the feeling aggregate. One who sees the fall of the feeling aggregate sees these five characteristics” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id51"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>I 55f.</em> ).</p>
<p>And as in the case of the feeling aggregate, [that is, substituting “contact” for the “nutriment” in the case of materiality,] so for the perception and formations <em>[659/717]</em> aggregates. So also for the consciousness aggregate with this difference, that for the phrases containing “contact” there are substituted “with the arising of mentality-materiality” and “with the cessation of mentality-materiality.”</p>
<p>So there are fifty characteristics stated with the ten in the case of each aggregate by seeing rise and fall, by means of which he gives attention in detail <em>according to condition</em> and <em>according to instant</em> (<em>moment</em>) in this way: “The rise of materiality is thus; its fall is thus; so it rises, so it falls.”</p>
<p id="xx-98"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-98"><span class="std std-ref">§98</span></a> As he does so his knowledge becomes clearer thus: “So, it seems, these states, not having been, are brought into being; having been, they vanish.”</p>
<p>When he thus sees rise and fall in the two ways, according to condition and according to instant, the several truths, aspects of the dependent origination, methods, and characteristics become evident to him.</p>
<p id="xx-99"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-99"><span class="std std-ref">§99</span></a> When he sees the arising of aggregates with the arising of ignorance and the cessation of aggregates with the cessation of ignorance, this is his seeing of rise and fall <em>according to condition.</em> When he sees the rise and fall of aggregates by seeing the characteristic of generation and the characteristic of change, this is his seeing of rise and fall <em>according to instant.</em> For it is only at the instant of arising that there is the characteristic of generation, and only at the instant of dissolution that there is the characteristic of change.</p>
<p id="xx-100"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-100"><span class="std std-ref">§100</span></a> So when he sees rise and fall in the two ways, according to condition and according to instant thus, the <em>truth</em> of origination becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery of the progenitor.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">632</span></code>  The truth of suffering becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to instant owing to his discovery of the suffering due to birth. The truth of cessation becomes evident to him through seeing fall according to condition owing to his discovery of the non-arising of things produced by conditions when their conditions do not arise. The truth of suffering becomes evident to him too through seeing fall according to instant owing to his discovery of the suffering due to death. And his seeing of rise and fall becomes evident to him as the truth of the path thus: “This is the mundane path” owing to abolition of confusion about it.</p>
<p id="xx-101"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-101"><span class="std std-ref">§101</span></a> The <em>dependent origination</em> in forward order becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery that “When this exists, that comes to be” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id52"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 262</em> ). The dependent origination in reverse order becomes evident to him through seeing fall according to condition owing to his discovery that “When this does not exist, that does not come to be” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id53"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 264</em> ). Dependently-arisen states become evident to him through seeing rise and fall according to instant owing to his discovery of the characteristic of the formed; for the things possessed of rise and fall are formed and conditionally arisen.</p>
<p id="xx-102"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-102"><span class="std std-ref">§102</span></a> The <em>method</em> of identity becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery of unbroken continuity in the connection of cause with fruit. Then he more thoroughly abandons the annihilation view. The method of diversity becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to instant owing to his discovery that each [state] is new [as it arises]. Then he more thoroughly abandons the eternity view. The method of uninterestedness becomes evident to <em>[660/718]</em> him through seeing rise and fall according to condition owing to his discovery of the inability of states to have mastery exercised over them. Then he more thoroughly abandons the self view. The method of ineluctable regularity becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery of the arising of the fruit when the suitable conditions are there. Then he more thoroughly abandons the moral-inefficacy-of-action view.</p>
<p id="xx-103"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-103"><span class="std std-ref">§103</span></a> The <em>characteristic</em> of not-self becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery that states have no curiosity and that their existence depends upon conditions. The characteristic of impermanence becomes evident to him through seeing rise and fall according to instant owing to his discovery of non-existence after having been and owing to his discovery that they are secluded from past and future. The characteristic of pain becomes evident to him [through that] too owing to his discovery of oppression by rise and fall. And the characteristic of individual essence becomes evident to him [through that] too owing to his discovery of delimitation [of states] by rise and fall. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id133" id="id54" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>69<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  And in the characteristic of individual essence the temporariness of the characteristic of what is formed becomes evident to him [through that] too owing to his discovery of the non-existence of fall at the instant of rise and the non-existence of rise at the instant of fall. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id135" id="id55" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>70<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="xx-104"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-104"><span class="std std-ref">§104</span></a> When the several truths, aspects of the dependent origination, methods, and characteristics have become evident to him thus, then formations appear to him as perpetually renewed: “So these states, it seems, being previously unarisen, critic, and being arisen, they cease.”  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">633</span></code>  And they are not only perpetually renewed, but they are also short-lived like dew-drops at sunrise ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id56"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>IV 137</em> ), like a bubble on water ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id57"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>III 14</em>  I), like a line drawn on water ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id58"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>IV 137</em> ), like a mustard seed on an awl’s point ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#nidd" id="id59"><span>[Nidd]</span></a> <em>I 42</em> ), like a lightning flash ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#nidd" id="id60"><span>[Nidd]</span></a> <em>I 43</em> ). And they appear without core, like a conjuring trick ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id61"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>III 141</em> ), like a mirage (Dhp 46), like a dream (Sn 807), like the circle of a whirling firebrand (source untraced), like a goblin city (source untraced), like froth (Dhp 46), like a plantain trunk ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#s" id="id62"><span>[S]</span></a> <em>III 142</em> ), and so on.</p>
<p>At this point he has attained tender insight-knowledge called contemplation of rise and fall, which has become established by penetrating the fifty characteristics in this manner: “Only what is subject to fall arises; and to be arisen necessitates fall.” With the attainment of this he is known as a “beginner of insight.”</p>
<section id="the-ten-imperfections-of-insight">
<h4>2.10.1 The Ten Imperfections of Insight</h4>
<p id="xx-105"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-105"><span class="std std-ref">§105</span></a> Now, when he is a beginner of insight with this tender insight, ten imperfections of insight arise in him. For imperfections of insight do not arise either in a noble disciple who has reached penetration [of the truths] or in persons <em>[661/719]</em> erring in virtue, neglectful of their meditation subject and idlers. They arise only in a clansman who keeps to the right course, devotes himself continuously [to his meditation subject] and is a beginner of insight. But what are these ten imperfections? They are: (1) illumination, (2) knowledge, (3) rapturous happiness, (4) tranquillity, (5) bliss (pleasure), (6) resolution, (7) exertion, (8) assurance, (9) equanimity, and (10) attachment.</p>
<p id="xx-106"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-106"><span class="std std-ref">§106</span></a> For this is said: “How does the mind come to be seized by agitation about higher states? When a man is bringing [formations] to mind as impermanent, illumination arises in him. He adverts to the illumination thus, ‘Illumination is a [Noble One’s] state.’ <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id137" id="id63" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>71<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  The distraction due to that is agitation. When his mind is seized by that agitation, he does not understand correctly [their] appearance as impermanent, he does not understand correctly [their] appearance as painful, he does not understand correctly [their] appearance as not-self.</p>
<p id="xx-107"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-107"><span class="std std-ref">§107</span></a> “Likewise, when he is bringing [formations] to mind as impermanent, knowledge arises in him … happiness … tranquillity … bliss … resolution … exertion … establishment … equanimity … attachment arises in him. He adverts to the attachment thus, ‘Attachment is a [Noble One’s] state.’ The distraction due to that is agitation. When his mind is seized by that agitation, he does not correctly understand [their] appearance as impermanent,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">634</span></code>  he does not correctly understand [their] appearance as painful, he does not correctly understand [their] appearance as not-self” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id64"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>II 100</em> ). <em>1.</em> Herein, illumination is illumination due to insight. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id140" id="id65" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>72<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  When it arises, the meditator thinks, “Such illumination never arose in me before. I have surely reached the path, reached fruition;” thus he takes what is not the path to be the path and what is not fruition to be fruition. When he takes what is not the path to be the path <em>[662/720]</em> and what is not fruition to be fruition, the course of his insight is interrupted. He drops his own basic meditation subject and sits just enjoying the illumination.</p>
<p id="xx-108"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-108"><span class="std std-ref">§108</span></a> But this illumination arises in one bhikkhu illuminating only as much as the seat he is sitting on; in another, the interior of his room; in another, the exterior of his room; in another the whole monastery … a quarter league … a half league … a league … two leagues … three leagues; in another bhikkhu it arises making a single light from the earth’s surface up to the Brahmā-world. But in the Blessed One it arose illuminating the ten-thousandfold world-element.</p>
<p id="xx-109"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-109"><span class="std std-ref">§109</span></a> This story illustrates how it varies. Two elders, it seems, were sitting inside a room with a double wall at Cittalapabbata. It was the Uposatha of the dark of the moon that day. All directions were covered by a blanket of cloud, and at night the four-factored gloom <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id142" id="id66" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>73<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  prevailed. Then one elder said, “Venerable sir, the flowers of the five colours on the lion table on the shrine terrace are visible to me now.” The other said, “What you say is nothing wonderful, friend. Actually the fishes and turtles in the ocean a league away are visible to me now.”</p>
<p id="xx-110"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-110"><span class="std std-ref">§110</span></a> This imperfection of insight usually arises in one who has acquired serenity and insight. Because the defilements suppressed by the attainments do not manifest themselves, he thinks, “I am an Arahant,” like the Elder Mahā-Nāga who lived at Uccavālika, like the Elder Mahā-Datta who lived at Haṅkana, like the Elder Cūḷa-Sumana who lived in the Nikapenna meditation house at Cittalapabbata.</p>
<p id="xx-111"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-111"><span class="std std-ref">§111</span></a> Here is one story as an illustration. The Elder Dhammadinna, it seems, who lived at Talaṅgara—one of the great ones with cankers destroyed who possessed the categories of discrimination—was the instructor of a large community of bhikkhus. One day, as he was sitting in his own daytime quarters, he wondered, “Has our teacher, the Elder Mahā-Nāga who lives at Uccavālika,  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">635</span></code>  brought his work of asceticism to its conclusion, or not?” He saw that he was still an ordinary man, and he knew that if he did not go to him, he would die an ordinary man. He rose up into the air with supernormal power and alighted near the elder, who was sitting in his daytime quarters. He paid homage to him, doing his duty, and sat down at one side. To the question, “Why have you come unexpectedly, friend Dhammadinna?” he replied, “I have come to ask a question, venerable sir.” He was told, “Ask, friend. If we know, we shall say.” He asked a thousand questions.</p>
<p id="xx-112"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-112"><span class="std std-ref">§112</span></a> The elder replied without hesitation to each question. To the remark, “Your knowledge is very keen, venerable sir; when was this state attained by you?” he replied, “Sixty years ago, friend.” “Do you practice concentration, venerable sir?”—“That is not difficult, friend.”—“Then make an elephant, venerable sir.” The elder made an elephant all white. “Now, venerable sir, make that elephant come straight at you with his ears outstretched, his tail extended, putting his trunk in his mouth and making a horrible trumpeting.” The elder did so. Seeing the frightful aspect of the rapidly approaching elephant, he sprang up and made to run away. Then the elder with cankers destroyed put out his hand, and catching him by the hem of his robe, he said, “Venerable sir, is there any timidity in one whose cankers are destroyed?”</p>
<p id="xx-113"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-113"><span class="std std-ref">§113</span></a> <em>[663/721]</em> Then he recognized that he was still an ordinary man. He knelt at Dhammadinna’s feet and said, “Help me, friend Dhammadinna.”—“Venerable sir, I will help you; that is why I came. Do not worry.” Then he expounded a meditation subject to him. The elder took the meditation subject and went up on to the walk, and with the third footstep he reached Arahantship. The elder was a bhikkhu of hating temperament, it seems. Such bhikkhus waver on account of illumination.</p>
<p id="xx-114"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-114"><span class="std std-ref">§114</span></a> <em>2. Knowledge</em> is knowledge due to insight. As he is estimating and judging material and immaterial states perhaps knowledge that is unerring, keen, incisive, and very sharp arises in him, like a lightning flash.</p>
<p id="xx-115"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-115"><span class="std std-ref">§115</span></a> <em>3. Rapturous happiness</em> is happiness due to insight. Perhaps at that time the five kinds of happiness, namely, minor happiness, momentary happiness, showering happiness, uplifting happiness, and pervading (rapturous) happiness arise in him filling his whole body.</p>
<p id="xx-116"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-116"><span class="std std-ref">§116</span></a> <em>4. Tranquillity</em> is tranquillity due to insight. As he is sitting at that time in his night or day quarters perhaps  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">636</span></code>  there is no fatigue or heaviness or rigidity or unwieldiness or sickness or crookedness in his body and his mind, but rather his body and mind are tranquillized, light, malleable, wieldy, quite sharp, and straight. With his body and mind aided by this tranquillity, etc., he experiences at that time the superhuman delight with reference to which it is said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A bhikkhu when his mind is quiet</div>
<div class="line">Retires to an empty place,</div>
<div class="line">And his right insight in the Dhamma</div>
<div class="line">Gives him superhuman delight.</div>
<div class="line">It is because he comprehends</div>
<div class="line">The rise and fall of aggregates</div>
<div class="line">That he finds happiness and joy</div>
<div class="line">And knows it to be deathless ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#dhp" id="id67"><span>[Dhp]</span></a> <em>373f.</em> ).</div>
</div>
<p>This is how tranquillity, associated with lightness, etc., arises in him, bringing about this superhuman delight.</p>
<p id="xx-117"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-117"><span class="std std-ref">§117</span></a> <em>5. Bliss</em> (<em>pleasure</em>) is bliss due to insight. At that time perhaps there arises in him exceedingly refined bliss (pleasure) flooding his whole body.</p>
<p id="xx-118"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-118"><span class="std std-ref">§118</span></a> <em>6. Resolution</em> is faith. For strong faith arises in him in association with insight in the form of extreme confidence of consciousness and its concomitants.</p>
<p id="xx-119"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-119"><span class="std std-ref">§119</span></a> <em>7. Exertion</em> is energy. For well-exerted energy, neither too lax nor too strained, arises in him in association with insight.</p>
<p id="xx-120"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-120"><span class="std std-ref">§120</span></a> <em>8. Assurance</em> (lit. establishment) is mindfulness. For well-established (well-assured), well-founded mindfulness, which is dug in and as immovable as the king of mountains, arises in him in association with insight. Whatever subject he adverts to, consciously reacts to, gives attention to, reviews, appears to him (he is assured of) owing to mindfulness, which descends into it, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id146" id="id68" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>74<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  enters into it, just as the other world does to one who has the divine eye.</p>
<p id="xx-121"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-121"><span class="std std-ref">§121</span></a> <em>[664/722]</em> <em>9. Equanimity</em> is both equanimity about insight and equanimity in adverting. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id148" id="id69" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>75<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  For equanimity about insight, which is neutrality about formations, arises strongly in him at that time. It is also equanimity in adverting in the mind door. For whatever the subject he adverts to, his adverting works as incisively and sharply as a lightning flash, like a red-hot spear plunged into a basket of leaves.</p>
<p id="xx-122"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-122"><span class="std std-ref">§122</span></a> 10. <em>Attachment</em> is attachment due to insight. For when his insight is adorned with illumination, etc., attachment arises in him, which is subtle and peaceful in aspect, and it relies on (clings to) that insight; and he is not able to discern that attachment as a defilement.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">637</span></code></p>
<p id="xx-123"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-123"><span class="std std-ref">§123</span></a> And as in the case of illumination, so too in the case of the other imperfections that may arise, the meditator thinks thus: “Such knowledge … such rapturous happiness … tranquillity … bliss … resolution … exertion … assurance … equanimity … attachment never arose in me before. I have surely reached the path, reached fruition.” Thus he takes what is not the path to be the path and what is not fruition to be fruition. When he takes what is not the path to be the path and what is not fruition to be fruition, the course of his insight is interrupted. He drops his basic meditation subject and sits just enjoying the attachment.</p>
<p id="xx-124"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-124"><span class="std std-ref">§124</span></a> And here illumination, etc., are called imperfections because they are the basis for imperfection, not because they are [kammically] unprofitable. But attachment is both an imperfection and the basis for imperfection.</p>
<p>As basis only they amount to ten; but with the different ways of taking them they come to thirty.</p>
<p id="xx-125"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-125"><span class="std std-ref">§125</span></a> How? When a man takes it thus, “illumination has arisen in me,” his way of taking is due to [false] view. When he takes it thus, “How agreeable this illumination that has arisen is,” his way of taking is due to pride (conceit). When he relishes the illumination, his way of taking is due to craving. So there are three ways of taking it in the case of illumination, that is to say, due to [false] view, to pride (conceit), and to craving. Likewise with the rest. So they come to thirty with the three ways of taking them. Owing to their influence an unskilful, unwary meditator wavers and gets distracted about illumination, etc., and he sees each one of them-illumination and the rest-as “This is mine, this is I, this is my self” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id70"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 135</em> ). Hence the Ancients said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">He wavers about illumination,</div>
<div class="line">And knowledge, rapturous happiness,</div>
<div class="line">About the tranquilness, the bliss,</div>
<div class="line">Whereby his mind becomes confused;</div>
<div class="line">He wavers about resolution,</div>
<div class="line">Exertion, and assurance, too,</div>
<div class="line">The adverting-equanimity,</div>
<div class="line">And equanimity and attachment ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id71"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>II 102</em> ).</div>
</div>
<p id="xx-126"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-126"><span class="std std-ref">§126</span></a> <em>[665/723]</em> But when illumination, etc., arise, a skilful, wary meditator who is endowed with discretion either defines and examines it with understanding thus: “This illumination has arisen. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id149" id="id72" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>76<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  But it is impermanent, formed, conditionally arisen, subject to destruction, subject to fall, subject to fading away, subject to cessation.” Or he thinks: “If illumination were self, it would be right to take it as self; but being not-self, it is taken as self. Therefore it is not-self in the sense of no power being exercisable over it; it is impermanent in the sense of non-existence after having come to be; it is painful in the sense of oppression by rise and fall,” all of which should be treated in detail according to the method given under the immaterial septad (<a class="reference internal" href="#xx-83"><span class="std std-ref">§83</span></a>). And as in the case of illumination, so too with the rest.</p>
<p id="xx-127"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-127"><span class="std std-ref">§127</span></a> Having investigated it thus, he sees the illumination as “This is not mine, this is not I, this is not my self.”  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">638</span></code>  He sees knowledge … (etc.) … attachment as “This is not mine, this is not I, this is not my self.” Seeing thus, he does not waver or vacillate about the illumination, and so on. Hence the Ancients said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">So when a man of understanding has</div>
<div class="line">Examined these ten things and is now skilled</div>
<div class="line">In agitation about higher states</div>
<div class="line">He no more falls a prey to wavering ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#patis" id="id73"><span>[Paṭis]</span></a> <em>II 102</em> ).</div>
</div>
<p id="xx-128"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-128"><span class="std std-ref">§128</span></a> So he unravels this thirtyfold skein of imperfections without falling a prey to wavering. He defines what is the path and what is not the path thus: “The states consisting in illumination, etc., are not the path; but it is insight knowledge that is free from imperfections and keeps to its course that is the path.”</p>
<p id="xx-129"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-129"><span class="std std-ref">§129</span></a> The knowledge that is established in him by his coming to know the path and the not-path thus, “This is the path, this is not the path,” should he understood as the purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path.</p>
<p id="xx-130"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-130"><span class="std std-ref">§130</span></a> So at this point the defining of three truths has been effected by him. How? The defining of the truth of suffering has been effected with the defining of mentality-materiality in the purification of view. The defining of the truth of origination has been effected with the discerning of conditions in the purification by overcoming doubt. The defining of the truth of the path has been effected with the emphasizing of the right path in this purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path. So the defining of three truths has been effected firstly by means of mundane knowledge only.</p>

But it is not so with the characteristics of impermanence, and so on.

<p>“‘<em>Contemplating as impermanent</em>’ is contemplating, comprehending, formations in the aspect of impermanence. ‘<em>The perception of permanence</em>’ is the wrong perception that they are permanent, eternal; the kinds of consciousness associated with wrong view should be regarded as included under the heading of ‘perception.’ So too with what follows. ‘<em>Becoming dispassionate</em>’ is seeing formations with dispassion by means of the contemplation of dispassion induced by the contemplations of impermanence, and so on. ‘<em>Delighting</em>’ is craving accompanied by happiness. ‘Causing fading away’ is contemplating in such a way that greed (<em>rāga</em>) for formations does not arise owing to the causing of greed to fade (<em>virajjana</em>) by the contemplation of fading away (<em>virāgānupassanā</em>); for one who acts thus is said to abandon greed. ‘<em>Causing cessation</em>’ is contemplating in such a way that, by the contemplation of cessation, formations cease only, they do not arise in the future through a new becoming; since one who acts thus is said to abandon the arousing (originating) of formations because of producing the nature of non-arising. ‘<em>Relinquishing</em>’ is relinquishing in such a way that, by the contemplation of relinquishment, formations are not grasped anymore; hence he said, ‘<em>He abandons grasping</em>’; or the meaning is that he relinquishes apprehending [them] as permanent, and so on” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vism-mht" id="id80"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>780</em> ).</p>

<p>‘<em>Contemplation of destruction</em>’ is the contemplation of the momentary dissolution of formations. ‘<em>Perception of compactness</em>’ is the assumption of unity in a continuity or mass or function or object. ‘<em>Contemplation of destruction</em>’ is contemplation of non-existence after having been, they say. Contemplation of destruction is the understanding by means of which he resolves the compact into its elements and sees that it is impermanent in the sense of destruction. Its completion starts with contemplation of dissolution, and so there is abandoning of perception of compactness then, but before that there is not, because it has not been completed. (9) The seeing of the dissolution of formations both by actual experience and by inference and the directing of attention to their cessation, in other words, their dissolution, is <em>contemplation of fall</em>; through it accumulation [of kamma] is abandoned; his consciousness does not incline with craving to the occurrence of that [aggregate-process of existence] for the purpose of which one accumulates [kamma]. (10) Seeing change in the two ways through aging and through death in what is born, or seeing another essence subsequent to the delimitation of such and such [an essence supervening] in what was discerned by means of the material septad, and so on, is ‘<em>contemplation of change</em>’; by its means he abandons the ‘<em>perception of lastingness</em>,’ the assumption of stability. (11)–(13) The three beginning with ‘<em>contemplation of the signless</em>’ are the same as the three beginning with contemplation of impermanence. (11) ‘<em>The sign</em>’ is the mere appearance of formations as if graspable entities, which is due to the individualization of particular functions and which, owing to perception of unity in continuity and in mass, is assumed to be temporarily enduring or permanent. (12) ‘<em>Desire</em>’ is longing for pleasure, or it is desire consisting in greed, and so on; it means inclinationto formations owing to craving. (13) ‘<em>Misinterpreting</em>’ is misinterpreting as self. It is owing to their opposing the ‘<em>sign</em>,’ etc., that the contemplations of impermanence, etc., are called by the names of ‘signless,’ etc.; so they should be regarded as opposed to the apprehension of a sign, etc., just as they are to the perception of permanence, and so on. (14) Insight that occurs by knowing an object consisting of a visible datum, etc., and by seeing the dissolution of the consciousness that had that visible datum, etc., as its object, and by apprehending voidness through the dissolution thus, ‘Only formations dissolve, there is nothing beyond the death of formations,’ is the higher understanding, and that is insight into states, thus it is ‘<em>insight into states that is higher understanding</em>’; by its means he abandons the view accompanied by craving that is the misinterpretation occurring as grasping at a permanent core, and so on. (15) ‘<em>Correct knowledge and vision</em>’ is a term for the seeing of mentality-materiality with its conditions; by its means he abandons the ‘<em>misinterpreting due to confusion</em>’ that begins thus, ‘Was I in the past?’ ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#m" id="id126"><span>[M]</span></a> <em>I 8</em> ) and that begins thus, ‘Thus the world is created by an Overlord’ (?). (16) The knowledge consisting in the seeing of danger in all kinds of becomings, etc., which has arisen owing to the appearance of terror is ‘<em>contemplation of danger</em>’; by its means he abandons the craving occurring as ‘<em>misinterpreting due to reliance</em>’ because he does not see any reliance or support. (17) The knowledge of reflection that is the means to deliverance from formations is ‘<em>contemplation of reflection</em>’; by its means he abandons the ignorance that is ‘<em>non-reflection</em>’ on impermanence, etc., and is opposed to reflection on them. (18) Equanimity about formations and conformity knowledge are ‘<em>contemplation of turning away</em>’; for owing to it the mind retreats and recoils from all formations, like a water drop on a lotus leaf, so by its means he abandons the ‘<em>misinterpretation due to bondage</em>,’ which is the occurrence of the defilements consisting of the fetters of sense desire, and so on.

<p>See <a class="reference internal" href="ch-22.xhtml#xxii-113"><span class="std std-ref">XXII.113f.</span></a> “When (1) the contemplation of impermanence is established, then the contemplations of (6) cessation, (8) destruction, (9) fall, and (10) change are partly established. When (2) the contemplation of pain is established, then the contemplations of (4) dispassion and (16) danger are partly established.

<p>“The interpreting of rise and fall must be done on a state that is present according to continuity or present according to instant but not on one that is past or future, which is why ‘of present states’ is said” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vism-mht" id="id130"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>808</em> ). “Present materiality is called born materiality; it is included in the trio of instants [of arising, presence and dissolution], is what is meant. But that is hard to discern at the start, so the interpreting by insight should be done by means of presence according to continuity” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vism-mht" id="id131"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>808</em> ). For the elision represented by “… (etc.) …” see <a class="reference internal" href="#xx-9"><span class="std std-ref">XX.9</span></a>. In this case, however, the last two members of the dependent origination are left out. “Although states possessed of aging-and-death are mentioned under the heading of birth and of aging-and-death in comprehension by groups, etc., nevertheless here in the description of knowledge of rise and fall, if it were said ‘present birth is born; the characteristic of its generation is rise, the characteristic of its change is fall,’ etc., it would be tantamount to an affirmation and approval of the proposition that birth and aging-and-death were possessed of birth and of aging-and-death. So the text ends with ‘becoming’ in order to avoid that” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vism-mht" id="id132"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>808</em> ).</p>

<p>“With the seeing of rise and fall not only the characteristics of impermanence and pain become evident, but also the characteristics, in other words, the individual essences, of earth, contact, etc., termed hardness, touching, etc., respectively, become clearly evident and discrete (<em>avacchinna</em>) in their individual essences” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vism-mht" id="id134"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>814</em> ).</p>

<p>“He adverts to it as Nibbāna or as the path or as fruition” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vism-mht" id="id138"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>816</em> ). “The agitation, the distraction, that occurs about whether or not the illumination, etc., are noble states is ‘<em>agitation about higher states’</em>” (Vism-mhṭ 815). In this connection Vism-mhṭ quotes the following text: “Friends, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who declares the attainment of Arahantship in my presence has always arrived there by four paths or by one of them. What four? Here, friends, a bhikkhu develops insight preceded by serenity. While he is developing insight preceded by serenity the path is born in him. He cultivates, develops, repeats that path. As he does so his fetters are abandoned and his inherent tendencies are brought to an end. Again, friends, a bhikkhu develops serenity preceded by insight … He develops serenity and insight yoked equally. Again, friends, a bhikkhu’s mind is seized by agitation about highest states. When that consciousness settles down internally, becomes steady, unified and concentrated, then the path is born in him … his inherent tendencies are brought to an end” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#a" id="id139"><span>[A]</span></a> <em>II 157</em> ).</p>

<p>“‘<em>Illumination due to insight</em>’ is the luminous materiality originated by insight consciousness, and that originated by temperature belonging to his own continuity. Of these, that originated by insight consciousness is bright and is found only in the meditator’s body. The other kind is independent of his body and spreads all round over what is capable of being experienced by knowledge. It becomes manifest to him too, and he sees anything material in the place touched by it” ( <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#vism-mht" id="id141"><span>[Vism-mhṭ]</span></a> <em>816</em> ).</p>

<p>“‘<em>Equanimity about insight</em>’ is neutrality in the investigation of formations owing to the objective field having been already investigated. But in meaning, when it occurs thus, it is only neutrality. The volition associated with mind-door adverting is called ‘<em>equanimity</em> (<em>upekkhā</em>) <em>in adverting</em>’ because it occurs in adverting as onlooking (<em>ajjhupekkhana</em>)” (Vism-mhṭ 819).</p>
