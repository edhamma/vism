<h1 id="a0000000212">1 (1) Loving-Kindness</h1>
<p><a name="IX.1" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.1" ><b class="bfseries">§1.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{349|291}</small></span><span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[295]</i></span> The four divine abidings were mentioned next to the recollections as meditation subjects (<a href="ch-09.html#III.105" >III.105</a>). They are loving-kindness, compassion, gladness and equanimity. A meditator, who wants to develop firstly loving-kindness among these, if he is a beginner, should sever the impediments and learn the meditation subject. Then, when he has done the work connected with the meal and got rid of any dizziness due to it, he should seat himself comfortably on a well-prepared seat in a secluded place. To start with, he should review the danger in hate and the advantage in patience. </p>
<p><a name="IX.2" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.2" ><b class="bfseries">§2.</b></a></a>  Why? Because hate has to be abandoned and patience attained in the development of this meditation subject, and he cannot abandon unseen dangers and attain unknown advantages. </p>
<p>Now, the danger in hate should be seen in accordance with such suttas as this: “Friends, when a man hates, is a prey to hate and his mind is obsessed by hate, he kills living things, and …” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#A" >A</a>
	]
</span>I 216</b>). And the advantage in patience should be understood according to such suttas as these: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> “No higher rule, the Buddhas say, than patience,<br /> And no Nibbāna higher than forbearance” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#D" >D</a>
	]
</span>II 49</b>; <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Dhp" >Dhp</a>
	]
</span>184</b>); </blockquote>
<blockquote class="verse"> “Patience in force, in strong array:<br /> ’Tis him I call a brahman” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Dhp" >Dhp</a>
	]
</span>399</b>); </blockquote>
<blockquote class="verse"> “No greater thing exists than patience” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>I 222</b>). </blockquote>
<p><a name="IX.3" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.3" ><b class="bfseries">§3.</b></a></a>  Thereupon he should embark upon the development of loving-kindness for the purpose of secluding the mind from hate seen as a danger and introducing it to patience known as an advantage. </p>
<p>But when he begins, he must know that some persons are of the wrong sort at the very beginning and that loving-kindness should be developed towards certain kinds of persons and not towards certain other kinds at first. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[296]</i></span> </p>
<p><a name="IX.4" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  For loving-kindness should not be developed at first towards the following four kinds of persons: an antipathetic person, a very dearly loved friend, a neutral person, and a hostile person. Also it should not be developed specifically (see <a href="ch-15.html#IX.49" >§49</a>) towards the opposite sex, or towards a dead person. </p>
<p><a name="IX.5" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.5" ><b class="bfseries">§5.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{350|292}</small></span>What is the reason why it should not be developed at first towards an antipathetic person and the others? To put an antipathetic person in a dear one’s place is fatiguing. To put a very dearly loved friend in a neutral person’s place is fatiguing; and if the slightest mischance befalls the friend, he feels like weeping. To put a neutral person in a respected one’s or a dear one’s place is fatiguing. Anger springs up in him if he recollects a hostile person. That is why it should not be developed at first towards an antipathetic person and the rest. </p>
<p><a name="IX.6" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.6" ><b class="bfseries">§6.</b></a></a>  Then, if he develops it specifically towards the opposite sex, lust inspired by that person springs up in him. An elder supported by a family was asked, it seems, by a friend’s son, “Venerable sir, towards whom should loving-kindness be developed?” The elder told him, “Towards a person one loves.” He loved his own wife. Through developing loving-kindness towards her he was fighting against the wall all the night.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000718">
  <sup class="footnotemark">1</sup>
</a> That is why it should not be developed specifically towards the opposite sex. </p>
<p><a name="IX.7" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.7" ><b class="bfseries">§7.</b></a></a>  But if he develops it towards a dead person, he reaches neither absorption nor access. A young bhikkhu, it seems, had started developing loving-kindness inspired by his teacher. His loving-kindness made no headway at all. He went to a senior elder and told him, “Venerable sir, I am quite familiar with attaining jhāna through loving-kindness, and yet I cannot attain it. What is the matter?” The elder said, “Seek the sign, friend, [the object of your meditation].” He did so. Finding that his teacher had died, he proceeded with developing loving-kindness inspired by another and attained absorption. That is why it should not be developed towards one who is dead. </p>
<p><a name="IX.8" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.8" ><b class="bfseries">§8.</b></a></a>  First of all it should be developed only towards oneself, doing it repeatedly thus: “May I be happy and free from suffering” or “May I keep myself free from enmity, affliction and anxiety and live happily.” </p>
<p><a name="IX.9" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.9" ><b class="bfseries">§9.</b></a></a>  If that is so, does it not conflict with what is said in the texts? For there is no mention of any development of it towards oneself in what is said in the Vibhaṅga: “And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart filled with loving-kindness? Just as he would feel loving-kindness on seeing a dearly loved person, so he pervades all beings with loving-kindness” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Vibh" >Vibh</a>
	]
</span>272</b>); and in what is said in the Paṭisambhidā: “In what five ways is the mind-deliverance of loving-kindness [practiced] with unspecified pervasion? May all beings be free from enmity, affliction and anxiety and live happily. May all breathing things <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[297]</i></span> … all who are born … all persons … all those who have a personality be free from enmity, affliction and anxiety and live happily” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Paṭis" >Paṭis</a>
	]
</span>II 130</b>); and in what is said in the Mettā Sutta: “In joy and safety may all beings be joyful at heart” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Sn" >Sn</a>
	]
</span>145</b>). [Does it not conflict with those texts?] </p>
<p><a name="IX.10" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.10" ><b class="bfseries">§10.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{351|293}</small></span>It does not conflict. Why not? Because that refers to absorption. But this [initial development towards oneself] refers to [making oneself] an example. For even if he developed loving-kindness for a hundred or a thousand years in this way, “I am happy” and so on, absorption would never arise. But if he develops it in this way: “I am happy. Just as I want to be happy and dread pain, as I want to live and not to die, so do other beings, too,” making himself the example, then desire for other beings’ welfare and happiness arises in him. And this method is indicated by the Blessed One’s saying: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> I visited all quarters with my mind<br /> Nor found I any dearer than myself;<br /> Self is likewise to every other dear;<br /> Who loves himself will never harm another (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>47</b>). </blockquote>
<p><a name="IX.11" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.11" ><b class="bfseries">§11.</b></a></a>  So he should first, as example, pervade himself with loving-kindness. Next after that, in order to proceed easily, he can recollect such gifts,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000719">
  <sup class="footnotemark">2</sup>
</a> kind words, etc., as inspire love and endearment, such virtue, learning, etc., as inspire respect and reverence met with in a teacher or his equivalent or a preceptor or his equivalent, developing loving-kindness towards him in the way beginning, “May this good man be happy and free from suffering.” With such a person, of course, he attains absorption. </p>
<p><a name="IX.12" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.12" ><b class="bfseries">§12.</b></a></a>  But if this bhikkhu does not rest content with just that much and wants to break down the barriers, he should next, after that, develop loving-kindness towards a very dearly loved friend, then towards a neutral person as a very dearly loved friend, then towards a hostile person as neutral. And while he does so, he should make his mind malleable and wieldy in each instance before passing on to the next. </p>
<p><a name="IX.13" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.13" ><b class="bfseries">§13.</b></a></a>  But if he has no enemy, or he is of the type of a great man who does not perceive another as an enemy even when the other does him harm, he should not interest himself as follows: “Now that my consciousness of loving-kindness has become wieldy towards a neutral person, I shall apply it to a hostile one.” <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[298]</i></span> Rather it was about one who actually has an enemy that it was said above that he should develop loving-kindness towards a hostile person as neutral. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000213">1.1 Getting Rid of Resentment</h2>
<p><a name="IX.14" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.14" ><b class="bfseries">§14.</b></a></a>  If resentment arises in him when he applies his mind to a hostile person because he remembers wrongs done by that person, he should get rid of the resentment by entering repeatedly into loving-kindness [jhāna] towards any of the first-mentioned persons and then, after he has emerged each time, directing loving-kindness towards that person. </p>
<p><a name="IX.15" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.15" ><b class="bfseries">§15.</b></a></a>  But if it does not die out in spite of his efforts, then: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> Let him reflect upon the saw<br /> With other figures of such kind,<br /> <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{352|294}</small></span>And strive, and strive repeatedly,<br /> To leave resentment far behind. </blockquote>
<p>He should admonish himself in this way: “Now, you who get angry, has not the Blessed One said this: ‘Bhikkhus, even if bandits brutally severed limb from limb with a two-handled saw, he who entertained hate in his heart on that account would not be one who carried out my teaching?’” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<blockquote class="verse"> ”To repay angry men in kind<br /> Is worse than to be angry first;<br /> Repay not angry men in kind<br /> And win a battle hard to win. </blockquote>
<blockquote class="verse"> The weal of both he does promote,<br /> His own and then the other’s too,<br /> Who shall another’s anger know<br /> And mindfully maintain his peace” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p>And this: “Bhikkhus, there are seven things gratifying and helpful to an enemy that happen to one who is angry, whether woman or man. What seven? Here, bhikkhus, an enemy wishes thus for his enemy, ‘Let him be ugly!’ Why is that? An enemy does not delight in an enemy’s beauty. Now, this angry person is a prey to anger, ruled by anger; though well bathed, well anointed, with hair and beard trimmed and clothed in white, yet he is ugly, being a prey to anger. This is the first thing gratifying and helpful to an enemy that befalls one who is angry, whether woman or man. Furthermore, an enemy wishes thus for his enemy, ‘Let him lie in pain!’ … ‘Let him have no fortune!’ … ‘Let him not be wealthy!’ … ‘Let him not be famous!’ … ’Let him have no friends!’ <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[299]</i></span> … ’Let him not on the breakup of the body, after death, reappear in a happy destiny in the heavenly world!’<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000720">

</a> Why is that? An enemy does not delight in an enemy’s going to a happy destiny. Now, this angry person is a prey to anger, ruled by anger; he misconducts himself in body, speech and mind. Misconducting himself thus in body, speech and mind, on the breakup of the body, after death, he reappears in a state of loss, in an unhappy destiny, in perdition, in hell, being a prey to anger” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="IX.16" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  If his resentment subsides when he strives and makes effort in this way, it is good. If not, then he should remove irritation by remembering some controlled and purified state in that person, which inspires confidence when remembered. </p>
<p><a name="IX.17" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.17" ><b class="bfseries">§17.</b></a></a>  For one person may be controlled in his bodily behaviour with his control in doing an extensive course of duty known to all, though his verbal and mental <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{353|295}</small></span>behaviour are not controlled. Then the latter should be ignored and the control in his bodily behaviour remembered. </p>
<p><a name="IX.18" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.18" ><b class="bfseries">§18.</b></a></a>  Another may be controlled in his verbal behaviour, and his control known to all—he may naturally be clever at welcoming kindly, easy to talk with, congenial, open-countenanced, deferential in speech, and he may expound the Dhamma with a sweet voice and give explanations of Dhamma with well-rounded phrases and details—though his bodily and mental behaviour are not controlled. Then the latter should be ignored and the control in his verbal behaviour remembered. </p>
<p><a name="IX.19" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.19" ><b class="bfseries">§19.</b></a></a>  Another may be controlled in his mental behaviour, and his control in worshiping at shrines, etc., evident to all. For when one who is uncontrolled in mind pays homage at a shrine or at an Enlightenment Tree or to elders, he does not do it carefully, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[300]</i></span> and he sits in the Dhamma-preaching pavilion with mind astray or nodding, while one whose mind is controlled pays homage carefully and deliberately, listens to the Dhamma attentively, remembering it, and evincing the confidence in his mind through his body or his speech. So another may be only controlled in his mental behaviour, though his bodily and verbal behaviour are not controlled. Then the latter should be ignored and the control in his mental behaviour remembered. </p>
<p><a name="IX.20" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.20" ><b class="bfseries">§20.</b></a></a>  But there may be another in whom not even one of these three things is controlled. Then compassion for that person should be aroused thus: “Though he is going about in the human world now, nevertheless after a certain number of days he will find himself in [one of] the eight great hells or the sixteen prominent hells.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000721">
  <sup class="footnotemark">4</sup>
</a>” For irritation subsides too through compassion. In yet another all three may be controlled. Then he can remember any of the three in that person, whichever he likes; for the development of loving-kindness towards such a person is easy. </p>
<p><a name="IX.21" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.21" ><b class="bfseries">§21.</b></a></a>  And in order to make the meaning of this clear the following sutta from the Book of Fives should be cited in full: “Bhikkhus, there are five ways of dispelling annoyance whereby annoyance arisen in a bhikkhu can be entirely dispelled” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p>Herein, he should first review this in himself thus: “Now, what is the point of your getting angry with him? Will not this kamma of yours that has anger as its source lead to your own harm?

<p><a name="IX.37" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.37" ><b class="bfseries">§37.</b></a></a>  But if he is still unable to quench that thought in this way, then he should review the advantages of loving-kindness thus: “Now, you who have gone forth into homelessness, has it not been said by the Blessed One as follows: ‘Bhikkhus, when the mind-deliverance of loving-kindness is cultivated, developed, much practiced, made the vehicle, made the foundation, established, consolidated, and properly undertaken, eleven blessings can be expected.

How? “Now, you who have gone forth into homelessness, when you are angry with him, what is it you are angry with? Is it head hairs you are angry with? Or body hairs? Or nails? … Or is it urine you are angry with? Or alternatively, is it the earth element in the head hairs, etc., you are angry with? Or the water element? Or the fire element?

<p><a name="IX.39" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.39" ><b class="bfseries">§39.</b></a></a>  But if he cannot effect the resolution into elements, he should try the giving of a gift. It can either be given by himself to the other or accepted by himself from the other. But if the other’s livelihood is not purified and his requisites are not proper to be used, it should be given by oneself. And in the one who does this the annoyance with that person entirely subsides. And in the other even anger that has been dogging him from a past birth subsides at the moment, as happened to the senior elder who received a bowl given to him at the Cittalapabbata Monastery by an almsfood-eater elder who had been three times made to move from his lodging by him, and who presented it with these words: “Venerable sir, this bowl worth eight ducats was given me by my mother who is a lay devotee, and it is rightly obtained; let the good lay devotee acquire merit.” So efficacious is this act of giving. And this is said: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> A gift for taming the untamed,<br /> A gift for every kind of good;<br /> Through giving gifts they do unbend<br /> And condescend to kindly speech. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[307]</i></span> </blockquote>
<h2 id="a0000000214">1.2 The Breaking Down of the Barriers—The Sign</h2>
<p><a name="IX.40" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.40" ><b class="bfseries">§40.</b></a></a>  When his resentment towards that hostile person has been thus allayed, then he can turn his mind with loving-kindness towards that person too, just as towards the one who is dear, the very dear friend, and the neutral person. Then he should break down the barriers by practicing loving-kindness over and over again, accomplishing mental impartiality towards the four persons, that is to say, himself, the dear person, the neutral person and the hostile person. </p>
<p><a name="IX.41" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.41" ><b class="bfseries">§41.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{360|302}</small></span>The characteristic of it is this. Suppose this person is sitting in a place with a dear, a neutral, and a hostile person, himself being the fourth; then bandits come to him and say, “Venerable sir, give us a bhikkhu,” and on being asked why, they answer, “So that we may kill him and use the blood of his throat as an offering;” then if that bhikkhu thinks, “Let them take this one, or this one,” he has not broken down the barriers. And also if he thinks, “Let them take me but not these three,” he has not broken down the barriers either. Why? Because he seeks the harm of him whom he wishes to be taken and seeks the welfare of the other only. But it is when he does not see a single one among the four people to be given to the bandits and he directs his mind impartially towards himself and towards those three people that he has broken down the barriers. Hence the Ancients said: </p>
<p><a name="IX.42" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.42" ><b class="bfseries">§42.</b></a></a>  When he discriminates between </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> The four, that is himself, the dear,<br /> The neutral, and the hostile one,<br /> Then “skilled” is not the name he gets,<br /> Nor “having amity at will,”<br /> But only “kindly towards beings.”<br /> Now, when a bhikkhu’s barriers<br /> Have all the four been broken down,<br /> He treats with equal amity<br /> The whole world with its deities;<br /> Far more distinguished than the first<br /> Is he who knows no barriers. </blockquote>
<p><a name="IX.43" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.43" ><b class="bfseries">§43.</b></a></a>  Thus the sign and access are obtained by this bhikkhu simultaneously with the breaking down of the barriers. But when breaking down of the barriers has been effected, he reaches absorption in the way described under the earth kasiṇa without trouble by cultivating, developing, and repeatedly practicing that same sign. </p>
<p>At this point he has attained the first jhāna, which abandons five factors, possesses five factors, is good in three ways, is endowed with ten characteristics, and is accompanied by loving-kindness. And when that has been obtained, then by cultivating, developing, and repeatedly practicing that same sign, he successively reaches the second and third jhānas in the fourfold system, and the second, third and fourth in the fivefold system. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[308]</i></span> </p>

<p>And here, <em>may all beings be free from enmity </em>is one absorption; <em>free from affliction </em>is one absorption—free from affliction (<em>abyābajjha</em>) is free from afflictedness (<em>byābādha-rahita</em>);<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000725">

When asked “What is that?” he replied, “It is a thousand ducats, venerable sirs.” They told him, “Lay follower, it is not possible to distribute them after the going forth.

The elder asked, “Who is that?”—“It is I, Maṇiliyā, venerable sir.”—“What are you weeping for?”—“Because you are going away.”—“What good does my living here to you?”—“Venerable sir, as long as you live here non-human beings treat each other kindly.

<h1 id="a0000000216">2 (2) Compassion</h1>
<p><a name="IX.77" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.77" ><b class="bfseries">§77.</b></a></a>  One who wants to develop compassion should begin his task by reviewing the danger in lack of compassion and the advantage in compassion. </p>
<p>And when he begins it, he should not direct it at first towards the dear, etc., persons; for one who is dear simply retains the position of one who is dear, a very dear companion retains the position of a very dear companion, one who is neutral retains the position of one who is neutral, one who is antipathetic retains the position of one who is antipathetic, and one who is hostile retains the position of one who is hostile. One of the opposite sex and one who is dead are also not the field for it. </p>
<p><a name="IX.78" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.78" ><b class="bfseries">§78.</b></a></a>  In the Vibhaṅga it is said: “And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart endued with compassion? Just as he would feel compassion on seeing an unlucky, unfortunate person, so he pervades all beings with compassion” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Vibh" >Vibh</a>

</span>273</b>). Therefore first of all, on seeing a wretched man, unlucky, unfortunate, in every way a fit object for compassion, unsightly, reduced to utter misery, with hands and feet cut off, sitting in the shelter for the helpless with a pot placed before him, with a mass of maggots oozing from his arms and legs, and moaning, compassion should be felt for him in this way: “This being has indeed been reduced to misery; if only he could be freed from this suffering!” </p>
<p>But if he does not encounter such a person, then he can arouse compassion for an evil-doing person, even though he is happy, by comparing him to one about to be executed. How? </p>
<p><a name="IX.79" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.79" ><b class="bfseries">§79.</b></a></a>  Suppose a robber has been caught with stolen goods, and in accordance with the king’s command to execute him, the king’s men bind him and lead him off to the place of execution, giving him a hundred blows in sets of four. Then people give him things to chew and eat and also garlands and perfumes, unguents and betel leaves. Although <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[315]</i></span> he goes along eating and enjoying these things as though he were happy and well off, still no one fancies that he is really happy and well off. On the contrary people feel compassion for him, thinking, “This poor wretch is now about to die; every step he takes brings him nearer to the presence of death.” So too a bhikkhu whose meditation subject is compassion should arouse compassion for an [evil-doing] person even if he is happy: “Though this poor wretch is now happy, cheerful, enjoying his wealth, still for want of even one good deed done now in any one of the three doors [of body, speech and mind] he can come to experience untold suffering in the states of loss.” </p>
<p><a name="IX.80" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.80" ><b class="bfseries">§80.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{367|309}</small></span>Having aroused compassion for that person in that way, he should next arouse compassion for a dear person, next for a neutral person, and next for a hostile person, successively in the same way. </p>

<p>And here too when someone has done profitable deeds and the meditator sees or hears that he has been overtaken by one of the kinds of ruin beginning with ruin of health, relatives, property, etc., he deserves the meditator’s compassion; and so he does too in any case, even with no such ruin, thus “In reality he is unhappy,” because he is not exempt from the suffering of the round [of becoming]. And in the way already described the meditator should break down the barriers between the four kinds of people, that is to say, himself, the dear person, the neutral person and the hostile person. Then cultivating that sign, developing it and repeatedly practicing it, he should increase the absorption by the triple and quadruple jhāna in the way already stated under loving-kindness. </p>
<p><a name="IX.82" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.82" ><b class="bfseries">§82.</b></a></a>  But the order given in the Aṅguttara Commentary is that a hostile person should first be made the object of compassion, and when the mind has been made malleable with respect to him, next the unlucky person, next the dear person, and next oneself. That does not agree with the text, “an unlucky, unfortunate person” (<a href="ch-15.html#IX.78" >§78</a>).Therefore he should begin the development, break down the barriers, and increase absorption only in the way stated here. </p>
<p><a name="IX.83" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.83" ><b class="bfseries">§83.</b></a></a>  After that, the versatility consisting in the unspecified pervasion in five ways, the specified pervasion in seven ways, and the directional pervasion in ten ways, and the advantages described as “He sleeps in comfort,” etc., should be understood in the same way as given under loving-kindness. </p>

<p>Having thus aroused gladness with respect to a dear person, he can then direct it successively towards a neutral one, and after that towards a hostile one. </p>

<p>He should break down the barriers by means of mental impartiality towards the four, that is, towards these three and himself.

<h2 id="a0000000222">5.3 Purpose</h2>
<p><a name="IX.97" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.97" ><b class="bfseries">§97.</b></a></a>  The general purpose of these four divine abidings is the bliss of insight and an excellent [form of future] existence. That peculiar to each is respectively the warding off of ill will, and so on. For here loving-kindness has the purpose of warding off ill will, while the others have the respective purposes of warding off cruelty, aversion (boredom), and greed or resentment. And this is said too: “For this is the escape from ill will, friends, that is to say, the mind-deliverance of loving-kindness … For this is the escape from cruelty, friends, that is to say, the mind-deliverance of compassion … For this is the escape from boredom, friends, that is to say, the mind-deliverance of gladness … For this is the escape from greed, friends, that is to say, the mind-deliverance of equanimity” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="IX.98" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.98" ><b class="bfseries">§98.</b></a></a>  And here each one has two enemies, one near and one far. </p>
<p>The divine abiding of <em>loving-kindness </em><span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[319]</i></span> has greed as its near enemy,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000731">

</a> since both share in seeing virtues. Greed behaves like a foe who keeps close by a man, and it easily finds an opportunity. So loving-kindness should be well <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{371|313}</small></span>protected from it. And ill will, which is dissimilar to the similar greed, is its far enemy like a foe ensconced in a rock wilderness. So loving-kindness must be practiced free from fear of that; for it is not possible to practice loving-kindness and feel anger simultaneously (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

Such grief has been described in the way beginning, “When a man either regards as a privation failure to obtain visible objects cognizable by the eye that are sought after, desired, agreeable, gratifying and associated with worldliness, or when he recalls those formerly obtained that are past, ceased and changed, then grief arises in him. Such grief as this is called grief based on the home life” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="IX.100" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.100" ><b class="bfseries">§100.</b></a></a>  <em>Gladness </em>has joy based on the home life as its near enemy, since both share in seeing success. Such joy has been described in the way beginning, “When a man either regards as gain the obtaining of visible objects cognizable by the eye that are sought … and associated with worldliness, or recalls those formerly obtained that are past, ceased, and changed, then joy arises in him.

So gladness should be practiced free from fear of that; for it is not possible to practice gladness and be discontented with remote abodes and things connected with the higher profitableness simultaneously. </p>
<p><a name="IX.101" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.101" ><b class="bfseries">§101.</b></a></a>  <em>Equanimity </em>has the equanimity of unknowing based on the home life as its near enemy, since both share in ignoring faults and virtues. Such unknowing has been described in the way beginning, “On seeing a visible object with the eye equanimity arises in the foolish infatuated ordinary man, in the untaught ordinary man who has not conquered his limitations, who has not conquered future [kamma] result, who is unperceiving of danger. Such equanimity as this does not surmount the visible object. Such equanimity as this is called equanimity based on the home life” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

Therefore equanimity must be practiced free from fear of that; <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[320]</i></span> for it is not possible to look on with equanimity and be inflamed with greed or be resentful<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000732">

<h2 id="a0000000224">5.5 The Beginning, Middle and End, Etc.</h2>
<p><a name="IX.102" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.102" ><b class="bfseries">§102.</b></a></a>  Now, zeal consisting in desire to act is the beginning of all these things. Suppression of the hindrances, etc., is the middle. Absorption is the end. Their <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{372|314}</small></span>object is a single living being or many living beings, as a mental object consisting in a concept. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000225">5.6 The Order in Extension</h2>
<p><a name="IX.103" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.103" ><b class="bfseries">§103.</b></a></a>  The extension of the object takes place either in access or in absorption. Here is the order of it. Just as a skilled ploughman first delimits an area and then does his ploughing, so first a single dwelling should be delimited and loving-kindness developed towards all beings there in the way beginning, “In this dwelling may all beings be free from enmity.” When his mind has become malleable and wieldy with respect to that, he can then delimit two dwellings. Next he can successively delimit three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, one street, half the village, the whole village, the district, the kingdom, one direction, and so on up to one world-sphere, or even beyond that, and develop loving-kindness towards the beings in such areas. Likewise with compassion and so on. This is the order in extending here. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000226">5.7 The Outcome</h2>
<p><a name="IX.104" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.104" ><b class="bfseries">§104.</b></a></a>  Just as the immaterial states are the outcome of the kasiṇas, and the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception is the outcome of concentration, and fruition attainment is the outcome of insight, and the attainment of cessation is the outcome of serenity coupled with insight, so the divine abiding of equanimity is the outcome of the first three divine abidings. For just as the gable rafters cannot be placed in the air without having first set up the scaffolding and built the framework of beams, so it is not possible to develop the fourth (jhāna in the fourth divine abiding) without having already developed the third jhāna in the earlier (three divine abidings). </p>
<h2 id="a0000000227">5.8 Four Questions</h2>
<p><a name="IX.105" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.105" ><b class="bfseries">§105.</b></a></a>  And here it may be asked: But why are loving-kindness, compassion, gladness, and equanimity, called divine abidings? And why are they only four? And what is their order? And why are they called measureless states in the Abhidhamma? </p>
<p><a name="IX.106" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.106" ><b class="bfseries">§106.</b></a></a>  It may be replied: The divineness of the abiding (<em>brahmavihāratā</em>) should be understood here in the sense of best and in the sense of immaculate. For these abidings are the best in being the right attitude towards beings. And just as Brahmā gods abide with immaculate minds, so the meditators who associate themselves with these abidings abide on an equal footing with Brahmā gods. So they are called divine abidings in the sense of best and in the sense of immaculate. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[321]</i></span> </p>
<p><a name="IX.107" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.107" ><b class="bfseries">§107.</b></a></a>  Here are the answers to the questions beginning with “Why are they only four?”: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> Their number four is due to paths to purity<br /> And other sets of four; their order to their aim<br /> As welfare and the rest. Their scope is found to be<br /> Immeasurable, so “measureless states” their name. </blockquote>
<p><a name="IX.108" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.108" ><b class="bfseries">§108.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{373|315}</small></span>For among these, loving-kindness is the way to purity for one who has much ill will, compassion is that for one who has much cruelty, gladness is that for one who has much aversion (boredom), and equanimity is that for one who has much greed. Also attention given to beings is only fourfold, that is to say, as bringing welfare, as removing suffering, as being glad at their success, and as unconcern, [that is to say, impartial neutrality]. And one abiding in the measureless states should practice loving-kindness and the rest like a mother with four sons, namely, a child, an invalid, one in the flush of youth, and one busy with his own affairs; for she wants the child to grow up, wants the invalid to get well, wants the one in the flush of youth to enjoy for long the benefits of youth, and is not at all bothered about the one who is busy with his own affairs. That is why the measureless states are only four as “due to paths to purity and other sets of four.” </p>
<p><a name="IX.109" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.109" ><b class="bfseries">§109.</b></a></a>  One who wants to develop these four should practice them towards beings first as the promotion of the aspect of welfare—and loving-kindness has the promotion of the aspect of welfare as its characteristic; and next, on seeing or hearing or judging<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000733">
  <sup class="footnotemark">16</sup>
</a> that beings whose welfare has been thus wished for are at the mercy of suffering, they should be practiced as the promotion of the aspect of the removal of suffering—and compassion has the promotion of the aspect of the removal of suffering as its characteristic; and then, on seeing the success of those whose welfare has been wished for and the removal of whose suffering has been wished for, they should be practiced as being glad—and gladness has the act of gladdening as its characteristic; but after that there is nothing to be done and so they should be practiced as the neutral aspect, in other words, the state of an onlooker—and equanimity has the promotion of the aspect of neutrality as its characteristic; therefore, since their respective aims are the aspect of welfare, etc., their order should be understood to correspond, with loving-kindness stated first, then compassion, gladness and equanimity. </p>
<p><a name="IX.110" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.110" ><b class="bfseries">§110.</b></a></a>  All of them, however, occur with a measureless scope, for their scope is measureless beings; and instead of assuming a measure such as “Loving-kindness, etc., should be developed only towards a single being, or in an area of such an extent,” they occur with universal pervasion. </p>
<p>That is why it was said: <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[322]</i></span> </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> Their number four is due to paths to purity<br /> And other sets of four; their order to their aim<br /> As welfare and the rest. Their scope is found to be<br /> Immeasurable, so “measureless states” their name. </blockquote>
<h2 id="a0000000228">5.9 As Producing Three Jhānas and Four Jhānas</h2>
<p><a name="IX.111" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.111" ><b class="bfseries">§111.</b></a></a>  Though they have a single characteristic in having a measureless scope, yet the first three are only of triple and quadruple jhāna [respectively in the fourfold and fivefold reckonings]. Why? Because they are not dissociated from <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{374|316}</small></span>joy. But why are their aims not dissociated from joy? Because they are the escape from ill will, etc., which are originated by grief. But the last one belongs only to the remaining single jhāna. Why? Because it is associated with equanimous feeling. For the divine abiding of equanimity that occurs in the aspect of neutrality towards beings does not exist apart from equanimous [that is to say, neither-painful-nor-pleasant] feeling. </p>
<p><a name="IX.112" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.112" ><b class="bfseries">§112.</b></a></a>  However, someone might say this: “It has been said by the Blessed One in the Book of Eights, speaking of the measureless states in general: ‘Next, bhikkhu, you should develop the concentration with applied thought and sustained thought, and you should develop it without applied thought and with sustained thought only, and you should develop it without applied thought and without sustained thought, and you should develop it with happiness, and you should develop it without happiness, and you should develop it accompanied by gratification, and you should develop it accompanied by equanimity’ (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="IX.113" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.113" ><b class="bfseries">§113.</b></a></a>  He should be told: “Do not put it like that. For if that were so, then contemplation of the body, etc., would also have quadruple and quintuple jhāna. But there is not even the first jhāna in the contemplation of feeling or in the other two.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000734">

<p><a name="IX.114" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.114" ><b class="bfseries">§114.</b></a></a>  And the intention here is this: The Blessed One, it seems, was asked to teach the Dhamma thus: “Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Blessed One’s Dhamma, I may dwell alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent and self-exerted” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

But the Blessed One had no confidence yet in that bhikkhu, since although he had already heard the Dhamma he had nevertheless gone on living there instead of going to do the ascetic’s duties, [and the Blessed One expressed his lack of confidence] thus: “So too, some misguided men merely question me, and when the Dhamma is expounded [to them], they still fancy that they need not follow me” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

However, the bhikkhu had the potentiality for the attainment of Arahantship, and so he advised him again, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[323]</i></span> saying: “Therefore, bhikkhu, you should train thus: ‘My mind shall be steadied, quite steadied internally, and arisen evil unprofitable things shall not obsess my mind and <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{375|317}</small></span>remain.’ You should train thus” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="IX.115" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.115" ><b class="bfseries">§115.</b></a></a>  After that he told him about its development by means of loving-kindness in order to show that he should not rest content with just that much but should intensify his basic concentration in this way: “As soon as your mind has become steadied, quite steadied internally, bhikkhu, and arisen evil unprofitable things do not obsess your mind and remain, then you should train thus: ‘The mind-deliverance of loving-kindness will be developed by me, frequently practiced, made the vehicle, made the foundation, established, consolidated, and properly undertaken.’ You should train thus, bhikkhu” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="IX.116" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.116" ><b class="bfseries">§116.</b></a></a>  The meaning is this: “Bhikkhu, when this basic concentration has been developed by you by means of loving-kindness, then, instead of resting content with just that much, you should make this basic concentration reach quadruple and quintuple jhāna in other objects by [further] developing it in the way beginning ‘With applied thought.’” </p>

For beings are unrepulsive to one who abides in loving-kindness.

<p><a name="IX.121" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.121" ><b class="bfseries">§121.</b></a></a>  One who abides in compassion has come to know thoroughly the danger in materiality, since compassion is aroused in him when he sees the suffering of beings that has as its material sign (cause) beating with sticks, and so on. So, well knowing the danger in materiality, when he removes whichever kasiṇa [concept he was contemplating], whether that of the earth kasiṇa or another, and applies his mind to the space [that remains (see <a href="ch-16.html#X.6" >X.6</a>)], which is the escape from materiality, then his mind enters into that [space] without difficulty. So compassion is the basic support for the sphere of boundless space, but not for what is beyond that. That is why it is called “having the base consisting of boundless space as the highest.” </p>
<p><a name="IX.122" ><a href="ch-15.html#IX.122" ><b class="bfseries">§122.</b></a></a>  When he abides in gladness, his mind becomes familiar with apprehending consciousness, since gladness is aroused in him when he sees beings’ consciousness arisen in the form of rejoicing over some reason for joy. Then when he surmounts the sphere of boundless space that he had already attained in due course and applies his mind to the consciousness that had as its object the sign of space, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[325]</i></span> his mind enters into it without difficulty. So gladness is the basic support for the base consisting of boundless consciousness, but not for what is beyond that.

For the Great Beings’ minds retain their balance by giving preference to beings’ welfare, by dislike of beings’ suffering, by desire for the various successes achieved by beings to last, and by impartiality towards all beings. And to all beings they give <em>gifts</em>, which are a source a pleasure, without discriminating thus: “It must be given to this one; it must not be given to this one.” And in order to avoid doing harm to beings they undertake the precepts of <em>virtue</em>. They practice <em>renunciation </em>for the purpose of perfecting their virtue. They cleanse their <em>understanding </em>for the purpose of non-confusion about what is good and bad for beings. They constantly arouse <em>energy</em>, having beings’ welfare and happiness at heart. When they have acquired heroic fortitude through supreme energy, they become <em>patient </em>with beings’ many kinds of faults. They <em>do not deceive </em>when <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{378|320}</small></span>promising “We shall give you this; we shall do this for you.” They are unshakably <em>resolute </em>upon beings’ welfare and happiness. Through unshakable <em>loving-kindness </em>they place them first [before themselves]. Through <em>equanimity </em>they expect no reward. Having thus fulfilled the [ten] perfections, these [divine abidings] then perfect all the good states classed as the ten powers, the four kinds of fearlessness, the six kinds of knowledge not shared [by disciples], and the eighteen states of the Enlightened One.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000739">

But development of equanimity, instead of occurring like that, makes beings its object by simply looking on. But does not the divine abiding of equanimity itself too make beings its object by directing the mind to apprehension of [what is existent in] the ultimate sense, because of the words, ‘Beings are owners of their deeds. Whose [if not theirs] is the choice by which they will become happy …?’ (§96)—Certainly that is so. But that is in the prior stage of development of equanimity.

So its occurrence is specially occupied with what is non-existent in the ultimate sense [i.e. beings, which are a concept].
