<p><a name="XI.1" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.1" ><b class="bfseries">§1.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{395|337}</small></span><span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[341]</i></span> Now comes the description of the development of the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, which was listed as the “one perception”<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000751">
  <sup class="footnotemark">1</sup>
</a> next to the immaterial states (<a href="ch-09.html#III.105" >III.105</a>). </p>
<p>Herein, it nourishes (<em>āharati</em>, lit. “brings on”), thus it is nutriment (<em>āhāra</em>, lit. “bringing on”). That is of four kinds as: physical nutriment, nutriment consisting of contact, nutriment consisting of mental volition, and nutriment consisting of consciousness.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000752">

Physical nutriment (<em>kabaliṅkārāhāra</em>) nourishes (brings on) the materiality of the octad that has nutritive essence as eighth:<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000753">
  <sup class="footnotemark">3</sup>
</a> contact as nutriment nourishes (brings on) the three kinds of feeling; mental volition as nutriment nourishes (brings on) rebirth-linking in the three kinds of becoming; consciousness as nutriment nourishes (brings on) mentality-materiality at the moment of rebirth-linking. </p>
<p><a name="XI.3" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.3" ><b class="bfseries">§3.</b></a></a>  Now, when there is physical nutriment there is attachment, which brings peril; when there is nutriment as contact there is approaching, which brings peril; when there is nutriment as mental volition there is rebirth-linking, which brings peril.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000754">
  <sup class="footnotemark">4</sup>
</a> And to show how they bring fear thus, physical nutriment should be illustrated by the simile of the child’s flesh (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XI.4" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  But of these four kinds of nutriment it is only physical nutriment, classed as what is eaten, drunk, chewed, and tasted, that is intended here as “nutriment” in this sense. The perception arisen as the apprehension of the repulsive aspect in that nutriment is, “perception of repulsiveness in nutriment.” </p>
<p><a name="XI.5" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.5" ><b class="bfseries">§5.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{397|339}</small></span>One who wants to develop that perception of repulsiveness in nutriment should learn the meditation subject and see that he has no uncertainty about even a single word of what he has learnt. Then he should go into solitary retreat and <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[342]</i></span> review repulsiveness in ten aspects in the physical nutriment classified as what is eaten, drunk, chewed, and tasted, that is to say, as to going, seeking, using, secretion, receptacle, what is uncooked (undigested), what is cooked (digested), fruit, outflow, and smearing. </p>
<p><a name="XI.6" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.6" ><b class="bfseries">§6.</b></a></a>  <em>1.</em> Herein, <em>as to going</em>: even when a man has gone forth in so mighty a dispensation, still after he has perhaps spent all night reciting the Enlightened One’s word or doing the ascetic’ s work, after he has risen early to do the duties connected with the shrine terrace and the Enlightenment-tree terrace, to set out the water for drinking and washing, to sweep the grounds and to see to the needs of the body, after he has sat down on his seat and given attention to his meditation subject twenty or thirty times<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000755">
  <sup class="footnotemark">5</sup>
</a> and got up again, then he must take his bowl and [outer] robe, he must leave behind the ascetics’ woods that are not crowded with people, offer the bliss of seclusion, possess shade and water, and are clean, cool, delightful places, he must disregard the Noble Ones’ delight in seclusion, and he must set out for the village in order to get nutriment, as a jackal for the charnel ground. </p>
<p><a name="XI.7" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.7" ><b class="bfseries">§7.</b></a></a>  And as he goes thus, from the time when he steps down from his bed or chair he has to tread on a carpet<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000756">
  <sup class="footnotemark">6</sup>
</a> covered with the dust of his feet, geckos’ droppings, and so on. Next he has to see the doorstep,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000757">
  <sup class="footnotemark">7</sup>
</a> which is more repulsive than the inside of the room since it is often fouled with the droppings of rats, bats,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000758">
  <sup class="footnotemark">8</sup>
</a> and so on. Next the lower terrace, which is more repulsive than the terrace above since it is all smeared with the droppings of owls, pigeons,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000759">
  <sup class="footnotemark">9</sup>
</a> and so on. Next the grounds,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000760">
  <sup class="footnotemark">10</sup>
</a> which are more repulsive than the lower floor since they are defiled by old grass and leaves blown about by the wind, by sick novices’ urine, excrement, spittle and snot, and in the rainy season by water, mud, and so on. And he has to see the road to the monastery, which is more repulsive than the grounds. </p>
<p><a name="XI.8" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.8" ><b class="bfseries">§8.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{398|340}</small></span>In due course, after standing in the debating lodge<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000761">
  <sup class="footnotemark">11</sup>
</a> when he has finished paying homage at the Enlightenment Tree and the shrine, he sets out thinking, “Instead of looking at the shrine that is like a cluster of pearls, and the Enlightenment Tree that is as lovely as a bouquet of peacock’s tail feathers, and the abode that is as fair as a god’s palace, I must now turn my back on such a charming place and go abroad for the sake of food;” and on the way to the village, the view of a road of stumps and thorns and an uneven road broken up by the force of water awaits him. </p>
<p><a name="XI.9" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.9" ><b class="bfseries">§9.</b></a></a>  Next, after he has put on his waist cloth as one who hides an abscess, and tied his waist band as one who ties a bandage on a wound, and robed himself in his upper robes as one who hides a skeleton, and taken out his bowl as one who takes out a pan for medicine, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[343]</i></span> when he reaches the vicinity of the village gate, perhaps the sight of an elephant’s carcass, a horse’s carcass, a buffalo’s carcass, a human carcass, a snake’s carcass, or a dog’s carcass awaits him, and not only that, but he has to suffer his nose to be assailed by the smell of them. </p>
<p>Next, as he stands in the village gateway, he must scan the village streets in order to avoid danger from savage elephants, horses, and so on. </p>
<p><a name="XI.10" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.10" ><b class="bfseries">§10.</b></a></a>  So this repulsive [experience] beginning with the carpet that has to be trodden on and ending with the various kinds of carcasses that have to be seen and smelled, [has to be undergone] for the sake of nutriment: “Oh, nutriment is indeed a repulsive thing!” </p>
<p>This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to going. </p>
<p><a name="XI.11" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.11" ><b class="bfseries">§11.</b></a></a>  <em>2. </em>How <em>as to seeking</em>? When he has endured the repulsiveness of going in this way, and has gone into the village, and is clothed in his cloak of patches, he has to wander in the village streets from house to house like a beggar with a dish in his hand. And in the rainy season wherever he treads his feet sink into water and mire up to the flesh of the calves.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000762">
  <sup class="footnotemark">12</sup>
</a> He has to hold the bowl in one hand and his robe up with the other. In the hot season he has to go about with his body covered with the dirt, grass, and dust blown about by the wind. On reaching such and such a house door he has to see and even to tread in gutters and cesspools covered with blue-bottles and seething with all the species of worms, all mixed up with fish washings, meat washings, rice washings, spittle, snot, dogs’ and pigs’ excrement, and what not, from which flies come up and settle on his outer cloak of patches and on his bowl and on his head. </p>
<p><a name="XI.12" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.12" ><b class="bfseries">§12.</b></a></a>  And when he enters a house, some give and some do not. And when they give, some give yesterday’s cooked rice and stale cakes and rancid jelly, sauce and so on.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000763">
  <sup class="footnotemark">13</sup>
</a> Some, not giving, say, “Please pass on, venerable sir,” others keep <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{399|341}</small></span>silent as if they did not see him. Some avert their faces. Others treat him with harsh words such as: “Go away, you bald-head.” When he has wandered for alms in the village in this way like a beggar, he has to depart from it. </p>
<p><a name="XI.13" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.13" ><b class="bfseries">§13.</b></a></a>  So this [experience] beginning with the entry into the village and ending with the departure from it, which is repulsive owing to the water, mud, etc., that has to be trodden in and seen and endured, [has to be undergone] for the sake of nutriment: “Oh, nutriment is indeed a repulsive thing!” </p>
<p>This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to seeking. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[344]</i></span> </p>
<p><a name="XI.14" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.14" ><b class="bfseries">§14.</b></a></a>  <em>3.</em> How <em>as to using</em>? After he has sought the nutriment in this way and is sitting at ease in a comfortable place outside the village, then so long as he has not dipped his hand into it he would be able to invite a respected bhikkhu or a decent person, if he saw one, [to share it]; but as soon as he has dipped his hand into it out of desire to eat he would be ashamed to say, “Take some.” And when he has dipped his hand in and is squeezing it up, the sweat trickling down his five fingers wets any dry crisp food there may be and makes it sodden. </p>
<p><a name="XI.15" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.15" ><b class="bfseries">§15.</b></a></a>  And when its good appearance has been spoilt by his squeezing it up, and it has been made into a ball and put into his mouth, then the lower teeth function as a mortar, the upper teeth as a pestle, and the tongue as a hand. It gets pounded there with the pestle of the teeth like a dog’s dinner in a dog’s trough, while he turns it over and over with his tongue; then the thin spittle at the tip of the tongue smears it, and the thick spittle behind the middle of the tongue smears it, and the filth from the teeth in the parts where a tooth-stick cannot reach smears it. </p>
<p><a name="XI.16" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  When thus mashed up and besmeared, this peculiar compound now destitute of the [original] colour and smell is reduced to a condition as utterly nauseating as a dog’s vomit in a dog’s trough. Yet, notwithstanding that it is like this, it can still be swallowed because it is no longer in range of the eye’s focus. </p>
<p>This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to using. </p>
<p><a name="XI.17" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.17" ><b class="bfseries">§17.</b></a></a>  <em>4.</em> How <em>as to secretion</em>? Buddhas and Paccekabuddhas and Wheel-turning Monarchs have only one of the four secretions consisting of bile, phlegm, pus and blood, but those with weak merit have all four. So when [the food] has arrived at the stage of being eaten and it enters inside, then in one whose secretion of bile is in excess it becomes as utterly nauseating as if smeared with thick <em>madhuka </em>oil; in one whose secretion of phlegm in excess it is as if smeared with the juice of <em>nāgabalā</em> leaves;<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000764">
  <sup class="footnotemark">14</sup>
</a> in one whose secretion of pus is in excess it is as if smeared with rancid buttermilk; and in one whose secretion of blood is in excess it is as utterly nauseating as if smeared with dye. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to secretion. </p>
<p><a name="XI.18" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.18" ><b class="bfseries">§18.</b></a></a>  <em>5.</em> How <em>as to receptacle</em>? When it has gone inside the belly and is smeared with one of these secretions, then the receptacle it goes into is no gold dish or crystal or silver dish and so on. On the contrary, if it is swallowed by one ten years old, it finds itself in a place like a cesspit unwashed for ten years. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[345]</i></span> If it is swallowed by one twenty years old, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{400|342}</small></span>years old, if it is swallowed by one a hundred years old, it finds itself in a place like a cesspit unwashed for a hundred years. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to receptacle. </p>
<p><a name="XI.19" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.19" ><b class="bfseries">§19.</b></a></a>  <em>6.</em> How <em>as to what is uncooked </em>(<em>undigested</em>)? After this nutriment has arrived at such a place for its receptacle, then for as long as it remains uncooked it stays in that same place just described, which is shrouded in absolute darkness, pervaded by draughts,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000765">
  <sup class="footnotemark">15</sup>
</a> tainted by various smells of ordure and utterly fetid and loathsome. And just as when a cloud out of season has rained during a drought and bits of grass and leaves and rushes and the carcasses of snakes, dogs and human beings that have collected in a pit at the gate of an outcaste village remain there warmed by the sun’s heat until the pit becomes covered with froth and bubbles, so too, what has been swallowed that day and yesterday and the day before remains there together, and being smothered by the layer of phlegm and covered with froth and bubbles produced by digestion through being fermented by the heat of the bodily fires, it becomes quite loathsome. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to what is uncooked. </p>
<p><a name="XI.20" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.20" ><b class="bfseries">§20.</b></a></a>  <em>7.</em> How <em>as to what is cooked</em>? When it has been completely cooked there by the bodily fires, it does not turn into gold, silver, etc., as the ores<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000766">
  <sup class="footnotemark">16</sup>
</a> of gold, silver, etc., do [through smelting]. Instead, giving off froth and bubbles, it turns into excrement and fills the receptacle for digested food, like brown clay squeezed with a smoothing trowel and packed into a tube, and it turns into urine and fills the bladder. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to what is cooked. </p>
<p><a name="XI.21" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.21" ><b class="bfseries">§21.</b></a></a>  <em>8.</em> How <em>as to fruit</em>? When it has been rightly cooked, it produces the various kinds of ordure consisting of head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, and the rest. When wrongly cooked it produces the hundred diseases beginning with itch, ring-worm, smallpox, leprosy, plague, consumption, coughs, flux, and so on. Such is its fruit. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to fruit. </p>
<p><a name="XI.22" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.22" ><b class="bfseries">§22.</b></a></a>  9. How <em>as to outflow</em>? On being swallowed, it enters by one door, after which it flows out by several doors in the way beginning, “Eye-dirt from the eye, ear-dirt from the ear” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Sn" >Sn</a>
	]
</span>197</b>). And on being swallowed it is swallowed even in the company of large gatherings. But on flowing out, now converted into excrement, urine, etc., it is excreted only in solitude. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[346]</i></span> On the first day one is delighted to eat it, elated and full of happiness and joy. On the second day one stops one’s nose to void it, with a wry face, disgusted and dismayed. And on the first day one swallows it lustfully, greedily, gluttonously, infatuatedly. But on the second day, after a single night has passed, one excretes it with distaste, ashamed, humiliated and disgusted. Hence the Ancients said: </p>
<p><a name="XI.23" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.23" ><b class="bfseries">§23.</b></a></a>  </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> The food and drink so greatly prized—<br /> The crisp to chew, the soft to suck—<br /> Go in all by a single door,<br /> But by nine doors come oozing out. </blockquote>
<blockquote class="verse"> <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{401|343}</small></span>The food and drink so greatly prized—<br /> The crisp to chew, the soft to suck—<br /> Men like to eat in company,<br /> But to excrete in secrecy. </blockquote>
<blockquote class="verse"> The food and drink so greatly prized—<br /> The crisp to chew, the soft to suck—<br /> These a man eats with high delight,<br /> And then excretes with dumb disgust. </blockquote>
<blockquote class="verse"> The food and drink so greatly prized—<br /> The crisp to chew, the soft to suck—<br /> A single night will be enough<br /> To bring them to putridity. </blockquote>
<p>This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to outflow. </p>
<p><a name="XI.24" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.24" ><b class="bfseries">§24.</b></a></a>  <em>10.</em> How <em>as to smearing</em>? At the time of using it he smears his hands, lips, tongue and palate, and they become repulsive by being smeared with it. And even when washed, they have to be washed again and again in order to remove the smell. And, just as, when rice is being boiled, the husks, the red powder covering the grain, etc., rise up and smear the mouth, rim and lid of the cauldron, so too, when eaten it rises up during its cooking and simmering by the bodily fire that pervades the whole body, it turns into tartar, which smears the teeth, and it turns into spittle, phlegm, etc., which respectively smear the tongue, palate, etc.; and it turns into eye-dirt, ear-dirt, snot, urine, excrement, etc., which respectively smear the eyes, ears, nose and nether passages. And when these doors are smeared by it, they never become either clean or pleasing even though washed every day. And after one has washed a certain one of these, the hand has to be washed again.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000767">
  <sup class="footnotemark">17</sup>
</a> And after one has washed a certain one of these, the repulsiveness does not depart from it even after two or three washings with cow dung and clay and scented powder. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to smearing. </p>
<p><a name="XI.25" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.25" ><b class="bfseries">§25.</b></a></a>  As he reviews repulsiveness in this way in ten aspects and strikes at it with thought and applied thought, physical nutriment <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[347]</i></span> becomes evident to him in its repulsive aspect. He cultivates that sign<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000768">
  <sup class="footnotemark">18</sup>
</a> again and again, develops and <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{402|344}</small></span>repeatedly practices it. As he does so, the hindrances are suppressed, and his mind is concentrated in access concentration, but without reaching absorption because of the profundity of physical nutriment as a state with an individual essence. But perception is evident here in the apprehension of the repulsive aspect, which is why this meditation subject goes by the name of “perception of repulsiveness in nutriment.” </p>
<p><a name="XI.26" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.26" ><b class="bfseries">§26.</b></a></a>  When a bhikkhu devotes himself to this perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, his mind retreats, retracts and recoils from craving for flavours. He nourishes himself with nutriment without vanity and only for the purpose of crossing over suffering, as one who seeks to cross over the desert eats his own dead child’s flesh (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>II 98</b>). Then his greed for the five cords of sense desire comes to be fully understood without difficulty by means of the full understanding of the physical nutriment. He fully understands the materiality aggregate by means of the full-understanding of the five cords of sense desire. Development of mindfulness occupied with the body comes to perfection in him through the repulsiveness of “what is uncooked” and the rest. He has entered upon a way that is in conformity with the perception of foulness. And by keeping to this way, even if he does not experience the deathless goal in this life, he is at least bound for a happy destiny. </p>
<p>This is the detailed explanation of the development of the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment. </p>
<h1 id="a0000000240">2 Defining of The Elements</h1>
<h2 id="a0000000241">2.1 Word Definitions</h2>
<p><a name="XI.27" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.27" ><b class="bfseries">§27.</b></a></a>  Now comes the description of the development of the definition of the four elements, which was listed as the “one defining” next to the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment (<a href="ch-09.html#III.105" >III.105</a>). </p>
<p>Herein, “defining” (<em>vavatthāna</em>) is determining by characterizing individual essences.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000769">
  <sup class="footnotemark">19</sup>
</a> [The compound] <em>catudhātuvavatthāna</em> (“four-element defining”) is [resolvable into] <em>catunnaṃ dhātūnaṃ vavatthānaṃ</em> (“defining of the four elements”). “Attention given to elements,” “the meditation subject consisting of elements” and “defining of the four elements” all mean the same thing. </p>

<p><a name="XI.29" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.29" ><b class="bfseries">§29.</b></a></a>  The meaning is this: <em>just as though a clever butcher</em>, or his <em>apprentice </em>who worked for his keep, <em>had killed a cow</em> and divided it up <em>and were seated at the crossroads</em>, reckoned as the intersection of the main roads going in the four directions, having laid it out part by part, <em>so too a bhikkhu reviews the body, however placed </em>because it is in some one of the four postures and <em>however disposed </em>because it is so placed, thus: <em>In this body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element</em>. </p>
<p><a name="XI.30" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.30" ><b class="bfseries">§30.</b></a></a>  What is meant? Just as the butcher, while feeding the cow, bringing it to the shambles, keeping it tied up after bringing it there, slaughtering it, and seeing it slaughtered and dead, does not lose the perception “cow” so long as he has not carved it up and divided it into parts; but when he has divided it up and is sitting there, he loses the perception “cow” and the perception “meat” occurs; he does not think “I am selling cow” or “They are carrying cow away,” but rather he thinks “I am selling meat” or “They are carrying meat away”; so too this bhikkhu, while still a foolish ordinary person—both formerly as a layman and as one gone forth into homelessness—does not lose the perception “living being” or “man” or “person” so long as he does not, by resolution of the compact into elements, review this body, however placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements. But when he does review it as consisting of elements, he loses the perception “living being” and his mind establishes itself upon elements. That is why the Blessed One said: “Bhikkhus, just as though a skilled butcher … were seated at the crossroads … so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu … air element.” </p>

This is called “internal” (<em>ajjhanaṃ = adhi + attā</em>, lit. “belonging-to-self”) because it occurs in self (<em>attani—</em>locative case) just as in the world, speech among women (<em>itthīsu—</em>loc. case) is called “[speech] belonging-to-women” (<em>adhitthi</em>). And it is called, “in oneself” (<em>paccattaṃ</em>) because it occurs owing to self (<em>attānaṃ paṭicca</em>).<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000772">

Herein, the first is a word for the characteristic, while the second is a word for the mode; for the earth element is characterized as hard, but its mode is rough, which is why it is called “harsh.” <em>Clung to</em>: taken firmly [by kamma]; the meaning is, firmly taken, seized, adhered to, as “I,” “mine” (see <a href="ch-17.html#XI.89" >§89f.</a>). </p>

The <em>watery </em>(<em>āpo-gata</em>) is what is gone (<em>gata</em>) among such various kinds of water (<em>āpo</em>) as the kamma-originated, and so on. What is that?

<p><a name="XI.36" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.36" ><b class="bfseries">§36.</b></a></a>  <em>Fire </em>(<em>tejo</em>) [is definable] as heating (<em>tejana</em>). The <em>fiery </em>(<em>tejo-gata</em>) is what is gone (<em>gata</em>), in the way already described, among the kinds of fire (<em>tejo</em>). What is that? It is what has the characteristic of heat. <em>Whereby</em>: by means of which the fire element, when excited, this body is <em>warmed</em>, becomes heated by the state of one-day fever,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000773">

<p>This, firstly, is the commentary on the texts here. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000244">2.4 Method of Development in Brief</h2>
<p><a name="XI.39" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.39" ><b class="bfseries">§39.</b></a></a>  As regards the method of development here, however, to discern the elements in detail in this way, “The head hairs are the earth element, the body hairs are the earth element,” appears redundant to a bhikkhu of quick understanding, though the meditation subject becomes clear to him if he gives his attention to it in this way: “What has the characteristic of stiffenedness is the earth element, what has the characteristic of cohesion is the water element, what has the characteristic of ripening (maturing) is the fire element, what has the characteristic of distending (supporting) is the air element.” But when one of not over-quick understanding gives his attention to it in this way, it appears obscure and unevident, and it only becomes plain to him if he gives his attention to it in the first-mentioned way. Why? </p>
<p><a name="XI.40" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.40" ><b class="bfseries">§40.</b></a></a>  Suppose two bhikkhus are reciting a text with many elided repetitions, then the bhikkhu with the quicker understanding fills out the elided repetitions once or twice, after which he goes on doing the recital with only the two end parts of the elisions. Here the one of less quick understanding says, “What is he reciting? Why, he does not even give one time to move one’s lips! If the recitation is done like this, when shall we ever get familiar with the text?” and so he does his recitation filling out each elision as it comes. Then the other says, “What is he reciting? Why, he never lets one get to the end of it! If the recitation is done like this; when shall we ever get to the end of it?” So too, the detailed discerning of the elements by head hairs, etc., appears redundant to one of quick understanding, though the meditation subject becomes clear to him if he gives his attention to it in brief in this way, “What has the characteristic of stiffenedness is the earth element,” and so on. But when the other gives his attention to it in this way, it appears obscure and unevident, and it only becomes plain to him if he gives his attention in detail by head hairs and so on. </p>
<p><a name="XI.41" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.41" ><b class="bfseries">§41.</b></a></a>  So firstly, one of quick understanding who wants to develop this meditation subject should go into solitary retreat. Then he should advert to his own entire material body and discern the elements in brief in this way: “In this body what is stiffenedness or harshness is the earth element, what is cohesion or fluidity<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000775">
  <sup class="footnotemark">25</sup>
</a> <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[352]</i></span> is the water element, what is maturing (ripening) or heat is the fire element, what is distension or movement is the air element.” And he should advert and give attention to it and review it again and again as “earth element, water element,” that is to say, as mere elements, not a living being, and soulless. </p>
<p><a name="XI.42" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.42" ><b class="bfseries">§42.</b></a></a>  As he makes effort in this way it is not long before concentration arises in him, which is reinforced by understanding that illuminates the classification of <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{407|349}</small></span>the elements, and which is only access and does not reach absorption because it has states with individual essences as its object. </p>
<p><a name="XI.43" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.43" ><b class="bfseries">§43.</b></a></a>  Or alternatively, there are these four [bodily] parts mentioned by the General of the Dhamma [the Elder Sāriputta] for the purpose of showing the absence of any living being in the four great primary elements thus: “When a space is enclosed with bones and sinews and flesh and skin, there comes to be the term ‘material form’ (<em>rūpa</em>)” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#M" >M</a>
	]
</span>I 190</b>). And he should resolve each of these [as a separate entity], separating them out by the hand of knowledge, and then discern them in the way already stated thus: “In these what is stiffenedness or harshness is the earth element.” And he should again and again advert to them, give attention to them and review them as mere elements, not a living being, not a soul. </p>
<p><a name="XI.44" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.44" ><b class="bfseries">§44.</b></a></a>  As he makes effort in this way, it is not long before concentration arises in him, which is reinforced by understanding that illuminates the classification of the elements, and which is only access and does not reach absorption because it has states with individual essences as its object. </p>
<p>This is the method of development when the definition of the elements is given in brief. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000245">2.5 Method of Development in Detail</h2>
<p><a name="XI.45" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.45" ><b class="bfseries">§45.</b></a></a>  The method given in detail should be understood in this way. A meditator of not over-quick understanding who wants to develop this meditation subject should learn the elements in detail in the forty-two aspects from a teacher, and he should live in an abode of the kind already described. Then, when he has done all the duties, he should go into solitary retreat and develop the meditation subject in four ways thus: (1) with constituents in brief, (2) with constituents by analysis, (3) with characteristics in brief, and (4) with characteristics by analysis. </p>
<h3 id="a0000000246">(1) With Constituents in Brief</h3>
<p><a name="XI.46" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.46" ><b class="bfseries">§46.</b></a></a>  Herein, how does he develop it <em>with constituents in brief</em>? Here a bhikkhu does his defining in this way, “In twenty of the parts what has the stiffened mode is the earth element,” and he does his defining thus, “In twelve parts the liquid called water with the mode of cohesion is the water element,” <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[353]</i></span> and he does his defining thus, “In four parts what matures (what has the mode of ripening) is the fire element,” and he does his defining thus, “In six parts what has the mode of distending is the air element.” As he defines them in this way they become evident to him. As he again and again adverts to them and gives his attention to them, concentration arises as access only. </p>
<h3 id="a0000000247">(2) With Constituents by Analysis</h3>
<p><a name="XI.47" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.47" ><b class="bfseries">§47.</b></a></a>  However, if his meditation subject is not successful while he develops it in this way, then he should develop it <em>with constituents by analysis</em>. How? Firstly, the bhikkhu should carry out all the directions given for the thirty-two-fold aspect in the description of mindfulness occupied with the body as a meditation subject (<a href="ch-14.html#VIII.48" >VIII.48</a>–<a href="ch-14.html#VIII.78" >78</a>), namely, the sevenfold skill in learning and the tenfold skill in giving <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{408|350}</small></span>attention, and he should start with the verbal recitation, in direct and reverse order, of the skin pentad and so on, without omitting any of it. The only difference is this: there, after giving attention to the head hairs, etc., as to colour, shape, direction, location, and delimitation, the mind had to be fixed by means of repulsiveness (<a href="ch-14.html#VIII.83" >VIII.83</a>), but here it is done by means of elements. Therefore at the end of each part after giving attention to head hairs, etc., each in the five ways beginning with colour (<a href="ch-14.html#VIII.83" >VIII.83</a>), attention should be given as follows. </p>
<p><a name="XI.48" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.48" ><b class="bfseries">§48.</b></a></a>  These things called <em>head hairs </em>grow on the inner skin that envelops the skull. Herein, just as when <em>kuṇṭha </em>grasses grow on the top of an anthill, the top of the termite-mound does not know, “<em>Kuṇṭha </em>grasses are growing on me,” nor do the <em>kuṇṭha </em>grasses know, “We are growing on the top of a termite-mound,” so too, the inner skin that covers the skull does not know, “Head hairs grow on me,” nor do the head hairs know, “We grow on inner skin that envelops a skull.” These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what are called <em>head hairs</em> are a particular component of this body, without thought, [morally] indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid (stiffened) earth element. </p>
<p><a name="XI.49" ><a href="ch-17.html#XI.49" ><b class="bfseries">§49.</b></a></a>  <em>Body hairs </em>grow on the inner skin that envelops the body.

Likewise their undemonstrability, since they are not found inside or outside each other though they rely upon each other for support. For if these elements were found inside each other, they would not each perform their particular functions, owing to mutual frustration. And if they were found outside each other, they would be already resolved (separate), and that being so, any description of them as unresolved (inseparable) would be meaningless.
