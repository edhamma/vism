<p><a name="VII.1" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.1" ><b class="bfseries">§1.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{244|186}</small></span><span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[197]</i></span> Now, ten recollections were listed next after the ten kinds of foulness (<a href="ch-09.html#III.105" >III.105</a>). As to these: </p>
<p>Mindfulness (<em>sati</em>) itself is recollection (<em>anussati</em>) because it arises again and again; or alternatively, the mindfulness (<em>sati</em>) that is proper (<em>anurūpa</em>) for a clansman gone forth out of faith, since it occurs only in those instances where it should occur, is “recollection” (<em>anussati</em>). </p>
<p>The recollection arisen inspired by the Enlightened One is the <em>recollection of the Buddha</em>. This is a term for mindfulness with the Enlightened One’s special qualities as its object. </p>
<p>The recollection arisen inspired by the Law is the <em>recollection of the Dhamma</em>.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000608">
  <sup class="footnotemark">1</sup>
</a> This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of the Law’s being well proclaimed, etc., as its object. <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{245|187}</small></span>The recollection arisen inspired by the Community is the <em>recollection of the Saṅgha</em>. This is a term for mindfulness with the Community’s special qualities of being entered on the good way, etc., as its object. </p>
<p>The recollection arisen inspired by virtue is the <em>recollection of virtue</em>. This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of virtue’s untornness, etc., as its object. </p>
<p>The recollection arisen inspired by generosity is the <em>recollection of generosity</em>. This is a term for mindfulness with generosity’s special qualities of free generosity, etc., as its object. </p>
<p>The recollection arisen inspired by deities is the <em>recollection of deities</em>. This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of one’s own faith, etc., as its object with deities standing as witnesses. </p>
<p>The recollection arisen inspired by death is the <em>recollection of death</em>. This is a term for mindfulness with the termination of the life faculty as its object. </p>
<p>[<em>Mindfulness occupied with the body (kāya-gatā sati—</em>lit. “body-gone mindfulness”):] it is gone (<em>gata</em>) to the material body (<em>kāya</em>) that is analyzed into head hairs, etc., or it is gone into the body, thus it is “body-gone” (<em>kāya-gatā</em>). It is body-gone (<em>kāya-gatā</em>) and it is mindfulness (<em>sati</em>), thus it is “body-gone-mindfulness” (<em>kāyagatasati—</em>single compound); but instead of shortening [the vowel] thus in the usual way, “body-gone mindfulness” (<em>kāyagatā sati—</em>compound adj. + noun) is said. This is a term for mindfulness that has as its object the sign of the bodily parts consisting of head hairs and the rest. </p>
<p>The mindfulness arisen inspired by breathing (<em>ānāpāna</em>) is <em>mindfulness of breathing</em>. This is a term for mindfulness that has as its object the sign of in-breaths and out-breaths. </p>
<p><span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{246|188}</small></span>The recollection arisen inspired by peace is the <em>recollection of peace</em>. This is a term that has as its object the stilling of all suffering. </p>

</a> who wants to develop firstly the recollection of the Enlightened One among these ten should go into solitary retreat in a favourable abode and recollect the special qualities of the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, as follows: </p>
<p>That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished, fully enlightened, endowed with [clear] vision and [virtuous] conduct, sublime, the knower of worlds, the incomparable leader of men to be tamed, the teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="VII.4" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  Herein, what he recollects firstly is that the Blessed One is <em>accomplished </em>(<em>arahanta</em>) for the following reasons: (i) because of remoteness (<em>āraka</em>), and (ii) because of his enemies (<em>ari</em>) and (iii) the spokes (<em>ara</em>) having been destroyed (<em>hata</em>), and (iv) because of his worthiness (<em>araha</em>) of requisites, etc., and (v) because of absence of secret (<em>rahābhāva</em>) evil-doing.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000610">

<p><a name="VII.5" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.5" ><b class="bfseries">§5.</b></a></a>  (i) He stands utterly remote and far away from all defilements because he has expunged all trace of defilement by means of the path—because of such remoteness (<em>āraka</em>) he is accomplished (<em>arahanta</em>). </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> A man remote (<em>āraka</em>) indeed we call<br /> From something he has not at all;<br /> The Saviour too that has no stain<br /> May well the name “accomplished” (<em>arahanta</em>) gain. </blockquote>

<blockquote class="verse"> The enemies (<em>ari</em>) that were deployed,<br /> Greed and the rest, have been destroyed (<em>hata</em>)<br /> By his, the Helper’s, wisdom’s sword,<br /> So he is “accomplished” (<em>arahanta</em>), all accord. </blockquote>
<p><a name="VII.7" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.7" ><b class="bfseries">§7.</b></a></a>  (iii) Now, this wheel of the round of rebirths with its hub made of ignorance and of craving for becoming, with its spokes consisting of formations of merit and the rest, with its rim of ageing and death, which is joined to the chariot of <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{247|189}</small></span>the triple becoming by piercing it with the axle made of the origins of cankers (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	<a href="ch-03.html#M" >M</a>

</span>I 55</b>), has been revolving throughout time that has no beginning. All of this wheel’s spokes (<em>ara</em>) were destroyed (<em>hata</em>) by him at the Place of Enlightenment, as he stood firm with the feet of energy on the ground of virtue, wielding with the hand of faith the axe of knowledge that destroys kamma—because the spokes are thus destroyed he is <em>accomplished</em> (<em>arahanta</em>) also. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000153">1.2 Dependent origination</h2>
<p><a name="VII.8" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.8" ><b class="bfseries">§8.</b></a></a>  Or alternatively, it is the beginningless round of rebirths that is called the “wheel of the round of rebirths.” Ignorance is its hub because it is its root. Ageing-and-death is its rim because it terminates it. The remaining ten states [of the dependent origination] are its spokes because ignorance is their root and ageing-and-death their termination. </p>
<p><a name="VII.9" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.9" ><b class="bfseries">§9.</b></a></a>  Herein, ignorance is unknowing about suffering and the rest. And ignorance in sensual becoming <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[199]</i></span> is a condition for formations in sensual becoming. Ignorance in fine-material becoming is a condition for formations in fine-material becoming. Ignorance in immaterial becoming is a condition for formations in immaterial becoming. </p>
<p><a name="VII.10" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.10" ><b class="bfseries">§10.</b></a></a>  Formations in sensual becoming are a condition for rebirth-linking consciousness in sensual becoming. And similarly with the rest. </p>
<p><a name="VII.11" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.11" ><b class="bfseries">§11.</b></a></a>  Rebirth-linking consciousness in sensual becoming is a condition for mentality-materiality in sensual becoming. Similarly in fine-material becoming. In immaterial becoming it is a condition for mentality only. </p>
<p><a name="VII.12" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.12" ><b class="bfseries">§12.</b></a></a>  Mentality-materiality in sensual becoming is a condition for the sixfold base in sensual becoming. Mentality-materiality in fine-material becoming is a condition for three bases in fine-material becoming. Mentality in immaterial becoming is a condition for one base in immaterial becoming. </p>
<p><a name="VII.13" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.13" ><b class="bfseries">§13.</b></a></a>  The sixfold base in sensual becoming is a condition for six kinds of contact in sensual becoming. Three bases in fine-material becoming are conditions for three kinds of contact in fine-material becoming. The mind base alone in immaterial becoming is a condition for one kind of contact in immaterial becoming. </p>
<p><a name="VII.14" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.14" ><b class="bfseries">§14.</b></a></a>  The six kinds of contact in sensual becoming are conditions for six kinds of feeling in sensual becoming. Three kinds of contact in fine-material becoming are conditions for three kinds of feeling there too. One kind of contact in immaterial becoming is a condition for one kind of feeling there too. </p>
<p><a name="VII.15" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.15" ><b class="bfseries">§15.</b></a></a>  The six kinds of feeling in sensual becoming are conditions for the six groups of craving in sensual becoming. Three in the fine-material becoming are for three there too. One kind of feeling in the immaterial becoming is a condition for one group of craving in the immaterial becoming. The craving in the several kinds of becoming is a condition for the clinging there. </p>
<p><a name="VII.16" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  Clinging, etc., are the respective conditions for becoming and the rest. In what way? Here someone thinks, “I shall enjoy sense desires,” and with sense-desire clinging as condition he misconducts himself in body, speech, and mind. Owing to the fulfilment of his misconduct he reappears in a state of loss (deprivation). The kamma that is the cause of his reappearance there is kamma-process<span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{248|190}</small></span> becoming, the aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirth-process becoming, the generating of the aggregates is birth, their maturing is ageing, their dissolution is death. </p>
<p><a name="VII.17" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.17" ><b class="bfseries">§17.</b></a></a>  Another thinks, “I shall enjoy the delights of heaven,” and in the parallel manner he conducts himself well. Owing to the fulfilment of his good conduct he reappears in a [sensual-sphere] heaven. The kamma that is the cause of his reappearance there is kamma-process becoming, and the rest as before. </p>
<p><a name="VII.18" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.18" ><b class="bfseries">§18.</b></a></a>  Another thinks, “I shall enjoy the delights of the Brahmā-world,” and with sense-desire clinging as condition he develops loving-kindness, compassion, gladness, and equanimity.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000611">
  <sup class="footnotemark">4</sup>
</a> <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[200]</i></span> Owing to the fulfilment of the meditative development he is reborn in the Brahmā-world. The kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is kamma-process becoming, and the rest is as before. </p>
<p><a name="VII.19" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.19" ><b class="bfseries">§19.</b></a></a>  Yet another thinks, “I shall enjoy the delights of immaterial becoming,” and with the same condition he develops the attainments beginning with the base consisting of boundless space. Owing to the fulfilment of the development he is reborn in one of these states. The kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is kamma-process becoming, the aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirth-process becoming, the generating of the aggregates is birth, their maturing is ageing, their dissolution is death (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#M" >M</a>

<p><a name="VII.20" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.20" ><b class="bfseries">§20.</b></a></a>  So, “Understanding of discernment of conditions thus, ‘Ignorance is a cause, formations are causally arisen, and both these states are causally arisen,’ is knowledge of the causal relationship of states. Understanding of discernment of conditions thus, ‘In the past and in the future ignorance is a cause, formations are causally arisen, and both these states are causally arisen,’ is knowledge of the causal relationship of states” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Paṭis" >Paṭis</a>

</span>I 50</b>), and all the clauses should be given in detail in this way. </p>
<p><a name="VII.21" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.21" ><b class="bfseries">§21.</b></a></a>  Herein, ignorance and formations are one summarization; consciousness, mentality-materiality, the sixfold base, contact, and feeling are another; craving, clinging, and becoming are another; and birth and ageing-and-death are another. Here the first summarization is past, the two middle ones are present, and birth and ageing-and-death are future. When ignorance and formations are mentioned, thentates, became dispassionate towards them, when his greed faded away, when he was liberated, then he destroyed, quite destroyed, abolished, the spokes of this wheel of the round of rebirths of the kind just described. </p>
<p><a name="VII.22" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.22" ><b class="bfseries">§22.</b></a></a>  Now, the Blessed One knew, saw, understood, and penetrated in all aspects this dependent origination with its four summarizations, its three times, its twenty aspects, and its three links. “Knowledge is in the sense of that being known,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000612">
  <sup class="footnotemark">5</sup>
</a> and understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding that. <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{249|191}</small></span>Hence it was said: ‘Understanding of discernment of conditions is knowledge of the causal relationship of states’” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	]
</span>I 52</b>). Thus when the Blessed One, by correctly knowing these states with knowledge of relations of states, became dispassionate towards them, when his greed faded away, when he was liberated, then he destroyed, quite destroyed, abolished, the spokes of this wheel of the round of rebirths of the kind just described. </p>
<p>Because the spokes are thus destroyed he is accomplished (<em>arahanta</em>) also. </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[201]</i></span>The spokes (<em>ara</em>) of rebirth’s wheel have been<br /> Destroyed (<em>hata</em>) with wisdom’s weapon keen<br /> By him, the Helper of the World,<br /> And so “accomplished” (<em>arahanta</em>) he is called. </blockquote>
<p><a name="VII.23" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.23" ><b class="bfseries">§23.</b></a></a>  (iv) And he is worthy (<em>arahati</em>) of the requisites of robes, etc., and of the distinction of being accorded homage because it is he who is most worthy of offerings. For when a Perfect One has arisen, important deities and human beings pay homage to none else; for Brahmā Sahampati paid homage to the Perfect One with a jewelled garland as big as Sineru, and other deities did so according to their means, as well as human beings as King Bimbisāra [of Magadha] and the king of Kosala. And after the Blessed One had finally attained Nibbāna, King Asoka renounced wealth to the amount of ninety-six million for his sake and founded eight-four thousand monasteries throughout all Jambudīpa (India). And so, with all these, what need to speak of others? Because of worthiness of requisites he is accomplished (<em>arahanta</em>) also. </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> So he is worthy, the Helper of the World,<br /> Of homage paid with requisites; the word<br /> “Accomplished” (<em>arahanta</em>) has this meaning in the world:<br /> Hence the Victor is worthy of that word. </blockquote>
<p><a name="VII.24" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.24" ><b class="bfseries">§24.</b></a></a>  (v) And he does not act like those fools in the world who vaunt their cleverness and yet do evil, but in secret for fear of getting a bad name. Because of absence of secret (<em>rahābhāva</em>) evil-doing he is accomplished (<em>arahanta</em>) also. </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> No secret evil deed may claim<br /> An author so august; the name<br /> “Accomplished” (<em>arahanta</em>) is his deservedly<br /> By absence of such secrecy (<em>rahābhāva</em>). </blockquote>
<p><a name="VII.25" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.25" ><b class="bfseries">§25.</b></a></a>  So in all ways: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> The Sage of remoteness unalloyed,<br /> Vanquished defiling foes deployed,<br /> The spokes of rebirth’s wheel destroyed,<br /> Worthy of requisites employed,<br /> Secret evil he does avoid:<br /> For these five reasons he may claim<br /> This word “accomplished” for his name. </blockquote>

<p>In fact, all things were discovered by him rightly by himself in that he discovered, of the things to be directly known, that they must be directly known (that is, learning about the four truths), of the things to be fully understood that they must be fully understood (that is, penetration of suffering), of the things to be abandoned that they must be abandoned (that is, penetration of the origin of suffering), of the things to be realized that they must be realized (that is, penetration of the cessation of suffering), and of the things to be developed that they must be developed (that is, penetration of the path).

<p>In this way he has discovered, progressively discovered, completely discovered, all states rightly and by himself step by step.

As he continues to exercise applied thought and sustained thought upon the Enlightened One’s special qualities, happiness arises in him. With his mind happy, with happiness as a proximate cause, his bodily and mental disturbances are tranquilized by tranquillity. When the disturbances have been tranquilized, bodily and mental bliss arise in him. When he is blissful, his mind, with the Enlightened One’s special qualities for its object, becomes concentrated, and so the jhāna factors eventually arise in a single moment. But owing to the profundity of the Enlightened One’s special qualities, or else owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts, the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption. And that access jhāna itself is known as “recollection of the Buddha” too, because it arises with the recollection of the Enlightened One’s special qualities as the means. </p>

When he encounters an opportunity for transgression, he has awareness of conscience and shame as vivid as though he were face to face with the Master.

<p>Even a single stanza of the Blessed One’s teaching is good in the beginning with the first word, good in the middle with the second, third, etc., and good in the end with the last word, because the Dhamma is altogether admirable. A sutta with a single sequence of meaning<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000637">
  <sup class="footnotemark">30</sup>
</a> is good in the beginning with the introduction, good in the end with the conclusion, and good in the middle with what is in between. A sutta with several sequences of meaning is good in the beginning with the first sequence of meaning, good in the end with the last sequence of meaning, and good in the middle with the sequences of meaning in between. Furthermore, it is good in the beginning with the introduction [giving the place of] and the origin [giving the reason for] its utterance. It is good in the middle because it suits those susceptible of being taught since it is unequivocal in meaning and reasoned with cause and example. It is good in the end with its conclusion that inspires faith in the hearers. </p>
<p><a name="VII.70" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.70" ><b class="bfseries">§70.</b></a></a>  Also the entire Dhamma of the Dispensation is good in the beginning with virtue as one’s own well-being.

It is good in the end with fruition and Nibbāna. Or alternatively, it is good in the beginning because it is the good discovery made by the Buddha. It is good in the middle because it is the well-regulatedness of the Dhamma. It is good in the end because it is the good way entered upon by the Saṅgha. Or alternatively, it is good in the beginning as the discovery of what can be attained by one who enters upon the way of practice in conformity after hearing about it. It is good in the middle as the unproclaimed enlightenment [of Paccekabuddhas]. It is good in the end as the enlightenment of disciples. </p>
<p><a name="VII.71" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.71" ><b class="bfseries">§71.</b></a></a>  And when listened to, it does good through hearing it because it suppresses the hindrances, thus it is good in the beginning.

And when it has thus been made the way of practice and the fruit of the way is ready, it does good through the fruit of the way because it brings [unshakable] equipoise, thus it is good in the end. </p>
<p>So it is “well proclaimed” because of being good in the beginning, the middle and the end. </p>
<p><a name="VII.72" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.72" ><b class="bfseries">§72.</b></a></a>  Now, the life of purity, that is to say, the life of purity of the Dispensation and the life of purity of the path, which the Blessed One announces, which he shows in various ways when he teaches the Dhamma, is “with meaning” because of perfection of meaning, and it is “with detail” because of perfection of detail, as it is proper that it should be. It is “with meaning” because it conforms to the words declaring its meaning by pronouncing, clarifying, revealing, expounding, and explaining it. It is “with detail” because it has perfection of syllables, words, details, style, language, and descriptions. It is “with meaning” owing to profundity of meaning and profundity of penetration. It is “with detail” owing to profundity of law and profundity of teaching. It is “with meaning” because it is the province of the discriminations of meaning and of perspicuity. It is “with detail” because it is the province of the discriminations of law and of language (see <a href="ch-21.html#XIV.21" >XIV.21</a>). It is “with meaning” since it inspires confidence in persons of discretion, being experienceable by the wise. It is “with detail” since it inspires confidence in worldly persons, being a fit object of faith. It is “with meaning” because its intention is profound. It is “with detail” because its words are clear. It is “utterly perfect” with the complete perfection due to absence of anything that can be added. It is “pure” with the immaculateness due to absence of anything to be subtracted. </p>
<p><a name="VII.73" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.73" ><b class="bfseries">§73.</b></a></a>  Furthermore, it is “with meaning” because it provides the particular distinction<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000638">

</a> of achievement through practice of the way, and it is “with detail” because it provides the particular distinction of learning through mastery of scripture. It is “utterly perfect” because it is connected with the five aggregates of Dhamma beginning with virtue.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000639">
  <sup class="footnotemark">32</sup>
</a> It is “pure” because it has no imperfection, because it exists for the purpose of crossing over [the round of rebirths’ flood (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p>So it is “well proclaimed” because it “announces the life of purity that is utterly perfect and pure with meaning and with detail.” </p>
<p>Or alternatively, it is <em>well proclaimed</em> since it has been properly proclaimed with no perversion of meaning. For the meaning of other sectarians’ law suffers perversion since there is actually no obstruction in the <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[215]</i></span> things described there as obstructive and actually no outlet in the things described there as outlets, <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{270|212}</small></span>which is why their law is ill-proclaimed; but not so the Blessed One’s Law, whose meaning suffers no perversion since the things described there as obstructions and the things described there as outlets are so in actual fact. </p>
<p>So, in the first place, the Dhamma of the scriptures is “well proclaimed.” </p>
<p><a name="VII.74" ><a href="ch-13.html#VII.74" ><b class="bfseries">§74.</b></a></a>  The supramundane Dhamma is <em>well proclaimed</em> since both the way that accords with Nibbāna and the Nibbāna that accords with the way have been proclaimed, according as it is said: “The way leading to Nibbāna has been properly declared to the disciples by the Blessed One, and Nibbāna and the way meet. Just as the water of the Ganges meets and joins with the water of the Yamunā, so too the way leading to Nibbāna has been properly declared to the disciples by the Blessed One, and Nibbāna and the way meet” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p>The fruits of asceticism, where defilements are tranquilized, are <em>well proclaimed too in being proclaimed to have tranquilized defilement.</em> </p>
<p>Nibbāna, whose individual essence is eternal, deathless, the refuge, the shelter, etc., is <em>well proclaimed</em> too in being proclaimed to have an individual essence that is eternal, and so on. </p>

For in this way the noble path conquers defilements by means of the proper view associated with it, and the noble fruition does so by means of the proper view that is its cause, and Nibbāna does so by means of the proper view that has Nibbāna as its objective field. So the ninefold supramundane Dhamma “has the proper view” (<em>sandiṭṭhika—</em>“is visible here and now”) since it conquers by means of proper view, just as a charioteer (<em>rathika</em>) is so called because he conquers by means of a chariot (<em>ratha</em>). </p>

But why is it worthy of this invitation? Because it is found and because of its purity. For if a man has said that there is money or gold in an empty fist, he cannot say, “Come and see it.” Why not? Because it is not found. And on the other hand, while dung or urine may well be found, a man cannot, for the purpose of cheering the mind by exhibiting beauty, say, “Come <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{272|214}</small></span>and see this;” on the contrary, they have to be covered up with grass and leaves. Why? Because of their impurity. But this ninefold supramundane Dhamma is actually found as such in its individual essence, and it is as pure as the full moon’s disk in a cloudless sky, as a gem of pure water on bleached cloth. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[217]</i></span> Consequently, it is worthy of the invitation to inspect since it is found and pure, thus it is “inviting of inspection.” </p>

  <li id="a0000000608"><a name="VII.n1" ></a><a href="ch-13.html#VII.n1" ><sup>¶</sup></a> The word <em>dhamma—</em>perhaps the most important and frequently used of Pali words—has no single equivalent in English because no English word has both a generalization so wide and loose as the word <em>dhamma</em> in its widest sense (which includes “everything” that can be known or thought of in any way) and at the same time an ability to be, as it were, focused in a set of well-defined specific uses. Roughly <em>dhamma</em> = what-can-be-remembered or what-can-be-borne-in-mind (<em>dhāretabba</em>) as <em>kamma</em> = what-can-be-done (<em>kātabba</em>). The following two principal (and overlapping) senses are involved here: (i) the Law as taught, and (ii) objects of consciousness. (i) In the first case the word has either been left untranslated as “Dhamma” or “dhamma” or it has been tendered as “Law” or “law.” This ranges from the loose sense of the “Good Law,” “cosmic law,” and “teaching” to such specific technical senses as the “discrimination of law,” “causality,” “being subject to or having the nature of.” (ii) In the second case the word in its looser sense of “something known or thought of” has either been left untranslated as “dhamma” or rendered by “state” (more rarely by “thing” or “phenomenon”), while in its technical sense as one of the twelve bases or eighteen elements “mental object” and “mental datum” have been used. The sometimes indiscriminate use of “dhamma,” “state” and “law” in both the looser senses is deliberate. The English words have been reserved as far as possible for rendering <em>dhamma</em> (except that “state” has sometimes been used to render <em>bhāva</em>, etc., in the sense of “-ness”). Other subsidiary meanings of a non-technical nature have occasionally been otherwise rendered according to context. 
In order to avoid muddle it is necessary to distinguish renderings of the word <em>dhamma</em> and renderings of the words used to define it. The word itself is a gerundive of the verb <em>dharati </em>(caus. <em>dhāreti—</em>“to bear”) and so is the literal equivalent of “[quality] that is to be borne.” But since the grammatical meanings of the two words <em>dharati</em> (“to bear”) and <em>dahati </em>(“to put or sort out,” whence <em>dhātu—</em>“element”) sometimes coalesce, it often comes very close to <em>dhātu</em> (but see VIII n. 68 and <a href="ch-17.html#XI.104" >XI.104</a>). If it is asked, what bears the qualities to be borne? A correct answer here would probably be that it is the event (<em>samaya</em>), as stated in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī (§1, etc.), in which the various dhammas listed there arise and are present, variously related to each other. The word <em>dhammin</em> (thing qualified or “bearer of what is to be borne”) is a late introduction as a logical term (perhaps first used in Pali by <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Vism-mhṭ" >Vism-mhṭ</a>

</span></b>, see p. 534). 
As to the definitions of the word, there are several. At D-a I 99 four meanings are given: moral (meritorious) special quality (<em>guṇa</em>), preaching of the Law (<em>desanā</em>), scripture (<em>pariyatti</em>), and “no-living-being-ness” (<em>nissattatā</em>).

And it is said accordingly in the Paṭisambhidā: “It knows all the formed and the unformed without remainder, thus it is omniscient knowledge. It has no obstruction therein, thus it is unobstructed knowledge” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Paṭis" >Paṭis</a>
	]
</span>I 131</b>), and so on. So they are not different kinds of knowledge. And there must be no reservation, otherwise it would follow that omniscient and unobstructed knowledge had obstructions and did not make all dhammas its object. There is not in fact a minimal obstruction to the 
Blessed One’s knowledge: and if his unobstructed knowledge did not have all dhammas as its object, there would be presence of obstruction where it did not occur, and so it would not be unobstructed. 
“Or alternatively, even if we suppose that they are different, still it is omniscient knowledge itself that is intended as ‘unhindered’ since it is that which occurs unhindered universally. And it is by his attainment of that that the Blessed One is known as Omniscient, All-seer, Fully Enlightened, not because of awareness (<em>avabodha</em>) of every dhamma at once, simultaneously (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>II 127</b>). And it is said accordingly in the Paṭisambhidā: ‘This is a name derived from the final liberation of the Enlightened Ones, the Blessed Ones, together with the acquisition of omniscient knowledge at the root of the Enlightenment Tree; this name “Buddha” is a designation based on realization’ (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	<a href="ch-03.html#Paṭis" >Paṭis</a>
	]
</span>I 174</b>). For the ability in the Blessed One’s continuity to penetrate all dhammas without exception was due to his having completely attained to knowledge capable of becoming aware of all dhammas. 
“Here it may be asked: But how then? When this knowledge occurs, does it do so with respect to every field simultaneously, or successively? For firstly, if it occurs simultaneously with respect to every objective field, then with the simultaneous appearance of formed dhammas classed as past, future and present, internal and external, etc., and of unformed and conventional (conceptual) dhammas, there would be no awareness of contrast (<em>paṭibhāga</em>), as happens in one who looks at a painted canvas from a distance. That being so, it follows that all dhammas become the objective field of the Blessed One’s knowledge in an undifferentiated form (<em>anirūpita-rūpana</em>), as they do through the aspect of not-self to those who are exercising insight thus ’All dhammas are not-self’ (Dhp 279; Th 678; <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>1076</b>). And those do not escape this difficulty who say that the Enlightened One’s knowledge occurs with the characteristic of presence of all knowable dhammas as its objective field, devoid of discriminative thinking (<em>vikappa-rahita</em>), and universal in time (<em>sabba-kāla</em>) and that is why they are called ’All-seeing’ and why it is said, ’The Nāga is concentrated walking and he is concentrated standing’ (?). 
They do not escape the difficulty since the Blessed One’s knowledge would then have only a partial objective field, because, by having the characteristic of presence as its object, past, future and conventional dhammas, which lack that characteristic, would be absent. So it is wrong to say that it occurs simultaneously with respect to every objective field. Then secondly, if we say that it occurs successively with respect to every objective field, that is wrong too. For when the knowable, classed in the many different ways according to birth, place, individual essence, etc., and direction, place, time, etc., is apprehended successively, then penetration without remainder is not effected since the knowable is infinite. And those are wrong too who say that the Blessed One is All-seeing owing to his doing his defining by taking one part of the knowable as that actually experienced (<em>paccakkha</em>) and deciding that the rest is the same because of the unequivocalness of its meaning, and that such knowledge is not inferential (<em>anumānika</em>) since it is free from doubt, because it is what is doubtfully discovered that is meant by inferential knowledge in the world. And they are wrong because there is no such defining by taking one part of the knowable as that actually experienced and deciding that the rest is the same because of the unequivocalness of its meaning, without making all of it actually experienced. For then that ‘rest’ is not actually experienced; and if it were actually experienced, it would no longer be ‘the rest.’ 
“All that is no argument.—Why not?—Because this is not a field for ratiocination; for the Blessed One has said this: ‘The objective field of Enlightened Ones is unthinkable, it cannot be thought out; anyone who tried to think it out would reap madness and frustration’ (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#A" >A</a>
	]
</span>II 80</b>). The agreed explanation here is this: Whatever the Blessed One wants to know—either entirely or partially—there his knowledge occurs as actual experience because it does so without hindrance. And it has constant concentration because of the absence of distraction. And it cannot occur in association with wishing of a kind that is due to absence from the objective field of something that he wants to know. There can be no exception to this because of the words, ‘All dhammas are available to the adverting of the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, are available at his wish, are available to his attention, are available to his thought’ (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Paṭis" >Paṭis</a>
	]
</span>II 195</b>). And the Blessed One’s knowledge that has the past and future as its objective field is entirely actual experience since it is devoid of assumption based on inference, tradition or conjecture. 
“And yet, even in that case, suppose he wanted to know the whole in its entirety, then would his knowledge not occur without differentiation in the whole objective field simultaneously? And so there would still be no getting out of that difficulty? “That is not so, because of its purifiedness. Because the Enlightened One’s objective field is purified and it is unthinkable. Otherwise there would be no unthinkableness in the knowledge of the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, if it occurred in the same way as that of ordinary people. So, although it occurs with all dhammas as its object, it nevertheless does so making those dhammas quite clearly defined, as though it had a single dhamma as its object. This is what is unthinkable here. ‘ 
There is as much knowledge as there is knowable, there is as much knowable as there is knowledge; the knowledge is limited by the knowable, the knowable is limited by the knowledge’ (Paṭis II l95). So he is Fully Enlightened because he has rightly and by himself discovered all dhammas together and separately, simultaneously and successively, according to his wish’ (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

He is <em>bhatavā</em> (possessor of what is borne) because he has borne (<em>bhata</em>) the perfections to their full development.

He has cultivated the blessings (<em>bhage vani</em>), that is, the mundane and supramundane blessings. He is <em>bhattavā</em> (possessor of devotees) because devoted (<em>bhatta</em>) people show devotion (<em>bhatti</em>) to him on account of his attainments. He has rejected blessings (<em>bhage vami</em>) such as glory, lordship, fame and so on. He has rejected the parts (<em>bhāge vami</em>) such as the five aggregates of experience, and so on (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

As to the word “<em>bhattavā</em>”: at <a href="ch-13.html#VII.63" >VII.63</a>, it is explained as “one who has frequented (<em>bhaji</em>) attainments.” In this sense the attainments have been “frequented” (<em>bhatta</em>) by him <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

In PED under <em>bhattavant</em> (citing also Vism 212) only the second meaning is given. <em>Bhatta</em> is from the same root (<em>bhaj</em>) in both cases.
