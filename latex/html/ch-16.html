</span>I 410</b>); and he sees danger in it too through the thousand afflictions beginning with eye disease. So, in order to surmount that, he enters upon the fourth jhāna in any one of the nine kasiṇas beginning with the earth kasiṇa and omitting the limited-space kasiṇa. </p>
<p><a name="X.2" ><a href="ch-16.html#X.2" ><b class="bfseries">§2.</b></a></a>  Now, although he has already surmounted gross physical matter by means of the fourth jhāna of the fine-material sphere, nevertheless he still wants also to surmount the kasiṇa materiality since it is the counterpart of the former. How does he do this? </p>
<p><a name="X.3" ><a href="ch-16.html#X.3" ><b class="bfseries">§3.</b></a></a>  Suppose a timid man is pursued by a snake in a forest and flees from it as fast as he can, then if he sees in the place he has fled to a palm leaf with a streak painted on it or a creeper or a rope or a crack in the ground, he is fearful, anxious and will not even look at it. Suppose again a man is living in the same village as a hostile man who ill-uses him and on being threatened by him with a flogging and the burning down of his house, he goes away to live in another village, then if he meets another man there of similar appearance, voice and manner, he is fearful, anxious and will not even look at him. </p>
<p><a name="X.4" ><a href="ch-16.html#X.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  Here is the application of the similes. The time when the bhikkhu has the gross physical matter as his object is like the time when the men were respectively threatened by the snake and by the enemy. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[327]</i></span> The time when the bhikkhu surmounts the gross physical matter by means of the fourth jhāna of the fine-material sphere is like the first man’s fleeing as fast as he can and the other man’s going away to another village. The bhikkhu’s observing that even the matter of the kasiṇa is the counterpart of that gross physical matter and his wanting to surmount that also is like the first man’s seeing in the place he had <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{380|322}</small></span>fled to the palm leaf with a streak painted on it, etc., and the other man’s seeing the man who resembled the enemy in the village he had left, and their unwillingness to look owing to fear and anxiety. </p>
<p>And here the similes of the dog attacked by a boar and that of the <em>pisāca </em>goblin and the timid man<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000740">

</a>should be understood too. </p>
<p><a name="X.5" ><a href="ch-16.html#X.5" ><b class="bfseries">§5.</b></a></a>  So when he has thus become disgusted with (dispassionate towards) the kasiṇa materiality, the object of the fourth jhāna, and wants to get away from it, he achieves mastery in the five ways. Then on emerging from the now familiar fourth jhāna of the fine-material sphere, he sees the danger in that jhāna in this way: “This makes its object the materiality with which I have become disgusted,” and “It has joy as its near enemy,” and “It is grosser than the peaceful liberations.” There is, however, no [comparative] grossness of factors here [as in the case of the four fine-material jhānas]; for the immaterial states have the same two factors as this fine-material [jhāna]. </p>
<p><a name="X.6" ><a href="ch-16.html#X.6" ><b class="bfseries">§6.</b></a></a>  When he has seen the danger in that [fine-material fourth jhāna] jhāna in this way and has ended his attachment to it, he gives his attention to the base consisting of boundless space as peaceful. Then, when he has spread out the kasiṇa to the limit of the world-sphere, or as far as he likes, he removes the kasiṇa [materiality] by giving his attention to the space touched by it, [regarding that] as “space” or “boundless space.” </p>
<p><a name="X.7" ><a href="ch-16.html#X.7" ><b class="bfseries">§7.</b></a></a>  When he is removing it, he neither folds it up like a mat nor withdraws it like a cake from a tin. It is simply that he does not advert to it or give attention to it or review it; it is when he neither adverts to it nor gives attention to it nor reviews it, but gives his attention exclusively to the space touched by it, [regarding that] as “space, space,” that he is said to “remove the kasiṇa.” </p>
<p><a name="X.8" ><a href="ch-16.html#X.8" ><b class="bfseries">§8.</b></a></a>  And when the kasiṇa is being removed, it does not roll up or roll away. It is simply that it is called “removed” on account of his non-attention to it, his attention being given to “space, space.” This is conceptualized as the mere space left by the removal of the kasiṇa [materiality]. Whether it is called “space left by the removal of the kasiṇa” or “space touched by the kasiṇa” or “space secluded from the kasiṇa,” it is all the same. </p>
<p><a name="X.9" ><a href="ch-16.html#X.9" ><b class="bfseries">§9.</b></a></a>  He adverts again and again to the sign of the space left by the removal of the kasiṇa <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[328]</i></span> as “space, space,” and strikes at it with thought and applied thought. As he adverts to it again and again and strikes at it with thought and applied thought, the hindrances are suppressed, mindfulness is established and his mind becomes concentrated in access. He cultivates that sign again and again, develops and repeatedly practices it. </p>
<p><a name="X.10" ><a href="ch-16.html#X.10" ><b class="bfseries">§10.</b></a></a>  As he again and again adverts to it and gives attention to it in this way, consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless space arises in <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{381|323}</small></span>absorption with the space [as its object], as the consciousness belonging to the fine-material sphere did in the case of the earth kasiṇa, and so on. And here too in the prior stage there are either three or four sensual-sphere impulsions associated with equanimous feeling, while the fourth or the fifth is of the immaterial sphere. The rest is the same as in the case of the earth kasiṇa (<a href="ch-10.html#IV.74" >IV.74</a>). </p>
<p><a name="X.11" ><a href="ch-16.html#X.11" ><b class="bfseries">§11.</b></a></a>  There is, however, this difference. When the immaterial-sphere consciousness has arisen in this way, the bhikkhu, who has been formerly looking at the kasiṇa disk with the jhāna eye finds himself looking at only space after that sign has been abruptly removed by the attention given in the preliminary work thus “space, space.” He is like a man who has plugged an opening in a [covered] vehicle, a sack or a pot<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000741">
  <sup class="footnotemark">2</sup>
</a>with a piece of blue rag or with a piece of rag of some such colour as yellow, red or white and is looking at that, and then when the rag is removed by the force of the wind or by some other agency, he finds himself looking at space. </p>

</a>Consequently, here the words “perception of matter” (<em>rūpa-saññā—</em>lit. “matter-perceptions”), in the sense of “perceptions about matter,” are used (a) for fine-material jhāna stated thus under the headings of “perceptions.” [Also] (b) it has the label (<em>saññā</em>) “matter” (<em>rūpa</em>), thus it (the jhāna’s object) is “labelled matter” (<em>rūpa-saññā</em>); what is meant is that “matter” is its name.

That is why in the Vibhaṅga only the surmounting of the perceptions and not that of the objects is mentioned as follows: “Herein, what are perceptions of matter? They are the perception, perceiving, perceivedness, in one who has attained a fine-material-sphere attainment or in one who has been reborn there or in one who is abiding in bliss there in this present life. These are what are called perceptions of matter. These perceptions of matter are passed, surpassed, surmounted.

<p><a name="X.49" ><a href="ch-16.html#X.49" ><b class="bfseries">§49.</b></a></a>  The word meaning here is this: that jhāna with its associated states neither has perception nor has no perception because of the absence of gross perception and the presence of subtle perception, thus it is “neither perception nor non-perception” (<em>n’ eva-saññā-nāsaññaṃ</em>). It is “neither perception nor non-perception” and it is a “base” (<em>āyatana</em>) because it is included in the mind-base (<em>manāyatana</em>) and the mental-object base (<em>dhammāyatana</em>), thus it is the “base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception” (<em>nevasaññānāsaññāyatana</em>). </p>
<p><a name="X.50" ><a href="ch-16.html#X.50" ><b class="bfseries">§50.</b></a></a>  Or alternatively: the perception here is neither perception, since it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception, nor yet non-perception, since it is present in a subtle state as a residual formation, thus it is “neither perception nor non-perception.” It is “neither perception nor non-perception” and it is a “base” in the sense of a foundation for the other states, thus it is the “base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception.” </p>
<p>And here it is not only perception that is like this, but feeling as well is neither-feeling-nor-non-feeling, consciousness is neither-consciousness-nor-non-consciousness, and contact is neither-contact-nor-non-contact, and the same description applies to the rest of the associated states; but it should be understood that this presentation is given in terms of perception. </p>
<p><a name="X.51" ><a href="ch-16.html#X.51" ><b class="bfseries">§51.</b></a></a>  And the meaning should be illustrated by the similes beginning with the smearing of oil on the bowl.

He said, “Venerable sir, there is oil in the bowl.” But then when he was told, “Bring the oil, novice, I shall fill the oil tube,” he replied, “There is no oil, venerable sir.” Herein, just as “There is oil” is in the sense of incompatibility with the gruel because it has been poured into [the bowl] and just as “There is no oil” is in the sense of filling the oil tube, etc., so too this perception is “neither perception” since <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{391|333}</small></span>it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception and it is “nor non-perception” because it is present in a subtle form as a residual formation. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[338]</i></span> </p>

He saw a little water and said, “There is water, venerable sir, remove your sandals.” Then the elder said, “If there is water, bring me the bathing cloth and let us bathe,” but the novice said, “There is none, venerable sir.” Herein, just as “There is water” is in the sense of mere wetting of the sandals, and “There is none” is in the sense of bathing, so too, this perception is “neither perception” since it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception, and it is “nor non-perception” because it is present in a subtle form as a residual formation. </p>

I think I shall stand outside.” <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[340]</i></span> So instead of leaning upon the one leaning upon the first, he remained outside. Then another arrived, and taking account of the insecurity of the one hanging on to the tent and the one leaning upon him, and fancying that the one standing outside was well placed, he stood leaning upon him. </p>
<p><a name="X.63" ><a href="ch-16.html#X.63" ><b class="bfseries">§63.</b></a></a>  Herein, this is how it should be regarded. The space from which the kasiṇa has been removed is like the tent in the dirty place. The [consciousness of the] base consisting of boundless space, which makes space its object owing to disgust with the sign of the fine-material, is like the man who hangs on to the tent owing to disgust with the dirt. The [consciousness of the] base consisting of boundless consciousness, the occurrence of which is contingent upon [the consciousness of] the base consisting of boundless space whose object is space, is like the man who leans upon the man who hangs on to the tent. The [consciousness of the] base consisting of nothingness, which instead of making [the consciousness of the] base consisting of boundless space its object has the non-existence of that as its object, is like the man who, after considering the insecurity of those two, does not lean upon the one hanging on to the tent, but stands outside. The [consciousness of the] base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception, the occurrence of which is contingent upon [the consciousness of] the base consisting of nothingness, which stands in a place outside, in other words, in the non-existence of [the past] consciousness, is like the man who stands leaning upon the last-named, having considered the insecurity of the one hanging on to the tent and the one leaning upon him, and fancying that the one standing outside is well placed. </p>

<p><a name="X.65" ><a href="ch-16.html#X.65" ><b class="bfseries">§65.</b></a></a>  For although this [consciousness of the] base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception has seen the flaw in the base consisting of nothingness in this way, “This attainment has the base consisting of boundless consciousness as its near enemy,” notwithstanding that fact it takes it as its object in the absence of any other. Like what? As men for the sake of livelihood depend on kings whose faults they see. For just as, for the sake of livelihood and because they cannot get a livelihood elsewhere, people put up with some king, ruler of all quarters, who is unrestrained, and harsh in bodily, verbal, and mental behaviour, though they see his faults thus, “He is harshly behaved,” so too the [consciousness of the] base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{394|336}</small></span>takes that base consisting of nothingness as its object in spite of seeing its faults in this way, and it does so since it cannot find another [better] object. </p>
