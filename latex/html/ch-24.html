<p><a name="XVII.4" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  Here is a brief explanation. The states that are conditions should be understood as the <em>dependent origination</em>. The states generated by such and such conditions are <em>dependently-originated states</em>. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.5" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.5" ><b class="bfseries">§5.</b></a></a>  How is that to be known? By the Blessed One’s word. For it is precisely those states which are conditions, that with the synonyms beginning with “reality” have been called “dependent origination” by the Blessed One when teaching the dependent origination in the sutta on the Teaching of the Dependent Origination and Dependently-originated States thus: </p>
<p>“And what is dependent origination, bhikkhus? </p>
<p>“With birth as condition, bhikkhus, there is ageing and death. Whether Perfect Ones arise or do not arise, there yet remains that element, relatedness of states, regularity of states, specific conditionally. The Perfect One discovers it, penetrates to it. Having discovered it, penetrated to it, he announces it, teaches it, makes it known, establishes, exposes, expounds, and explains it: ‘See,’ he says, ‘With birth as condition there is ageing and death.’ </p>
<p>“With becoming as condition, bhikkhus, there is birth … With ignorance as condition, bhikkhus, there are formations. Whether Perfect Ones arise or do not arise, there yet remains that element, relatedness of states, regularity of states, specific conditionally. The Perfect One discovers it, penetrates to it. Having discovered it, penetrated to it, he announces it, teaches it, makes it known, establishes, exposes, expounds and explains it: ‘See,’ he says, ‘With ignorance as condition there are formations.’ </p>
<p>“So, bhikkhus, that herein which is reality, not unreality, not otherness, specific conditionality: that is called dependent origination” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>II 25f.</b>). </p>
<p>Consequently, it should be understood that dependent origination has the characteristic of being the conditions for the states beginning with ageing-and-death. Its function is to continue [the process of] suffering. It is manifested as the wrong path. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.6" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.6" ><b class="bfseries">§6.</b></a></a>  Because particular states are produced by particular conditions, neither less nor more, it is called <em>reality</em> (suchness). Because once the conditions have met in combination there is no non-producing, even for an instant, of the states they generate, it is called not <em>unreality</em> (not unsuchness). Because there is no arising of one state with another state’s conditions, it is called <em>not otherness</em>. Because there is a condition, or because there is a total of conditions, for these states beginning with ageing-and-death as already stated, it is called <em>specific conditionality</em>. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.7" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.7" ><b class="bfseries">§7.</b></a></a>  Here is the word meaning: <em>idappaccayā</em> (lit. that-conditions) = <em>imesaṃ paccayā </em>(conditions for those); <em>idappaccayā</em> (that-conditions) = <em>idappaccayatā</em> (that-conditionality, conditionality for those, specific conditionality). Or alternatively, <em>idappaccayatā</em> (that-conditionality) = <em>idappaccayānaṃ samūho</em> (the total of that-conditions, total specific conditionality). </p>
<p><a name="XVII.8" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.8" ><b class="bfseries">§8.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{593|535}</small></span>The characteristic must be sought from grammar. Some, in fact, [say that the expression <em>paṭicca samuppāda</em> (dependent origination) is characterized thus:] “having depended (<em>paṭicca</em>), a right (<em>sammā</em>) arising (<em>uppāda</em>), [depending on causes rightly by] disregarding such causes conjectured by sectarians as the Primordial Essence (<em>Prakṛti</em>), World Soul (<em>Puruṣa</em>), and so on.” So what they call dependent origination (<em>paṭicca samuppāda</em>) is a simple arising (<em>uppāda</em>) [for they equate the prefix <em>saṃ</em> only with <em>sammā</em> (rightly) and ignore <em>saṃ</em> (with, con-)]. That is untenable. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[519]</i></span> Why? (1) There is no such sutta; (2) it contradicts suttas; (3) it admits of no profound treatment; and (4) it is ungrammatical. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.9" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.9" ><b class="bfseries">§9.</b></a></a>  (1) No sutta describes the dependent origination as simple arising. </p>
<p>(2) Anyone who asserts that dependent origination is of that kind involves himself in conflict with the Padesavihāra Sutta. How? The Newly Enlightened One’s abiding (<em>vihāra</em>) is the bringing of the dependent origination to mind, because, of these words of the Blessed One’s: “Then in the first watch of the night the Blessed One brought to mind the dependent origination in direct and reverse order” [as origination and cessation] (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>I 1</b>; <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	<a href="ch-03.html#Ud" >Ud</a>
	]
</span>2</b>). Now, “<em>padesavihāra</em>” is the abiding (<em>vihāra</em>) in one part (<em>desa</em>) of that, according as it is said, “Bhikkhus, I abode in a part of the abiding in which I abode when I was newly enlightened” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>I 107</b>). And there he abode in the vision of structure of conditions, not in the vision of simple arising, according as it is said, “So I understood feeling with wrong view as its condition, and feeling with right view as its condition, and feeling with wrong thinking as its condition …” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>V 12</b>), all of which should be quoted in full. So anyone who asserts that dependent origination is simple arising involves himself in conflict with the Padesavihāra Sutta. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.10" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.10" ><b class="bfseries">§10.</b></a></a>  There is likewise contradiction of the Kaccāna Sutta. For in the Kaccāna Sutta it is said, “When a man sees correctly with right understanding the origination of the world, Kaccāna, he does not say of the world that it is not” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>II 17</b>). And there it is the dependent origination in forward order, not simple arising, that, as the origination of the world from its conditions, is set forth in order to eliminate the annihilation view. For the annihilation view is not eliminated by seeing simple arising; but it is eliminated by seeing the chain of conditions as a chain of fruits following on a chain of conditions. So anyone who asserts that the dependent origination is simple arising involves himself in contradiction of the Kaccāna Sutta. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.11" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.11" ><b class="bfseries">§11.</b></a></a>  (3) <em>It admits of no profound treatment</em>: this has been said by the Blessed One, “This dependent origination is profound, Ānanda, and profound it appears” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#D" >D</a>

</span>II 55</b>; <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>II 92</b>). And the profundity is fourfold as we shall explain below (<a href="ch-24.html#XVII.304" >XVII.304f.</a>); but there is none of that in simple arising. And this dependent origination is explained [by the teachers] as adorned with the fourfold method (<a href="ch-24.html#XVII.309" >XVII.309</a>); but there is no [need of] any such tetrad of methods in simple arising. So dependent origination is not simple arising, since that admits of no profound treatment. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.12" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.12" ><b class="bfseries">§12.</b></a></a>  (4) <em>It is ungrammatical</em>: <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[520]</i></span> this word <em>paṭicca</em> (lit. “having depended”; freely “due to,” “dependent”), [being a gerund of the verb <em>paṭi + eti</em>, to go back to], <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{594|536}</small></span>establishes a meaning [in a formula of establishment by verb] when it is construed as past with the same subject [as that of the principal verb], as in the sentence “Having depended on (<em>paṭicca</em> = ‘due to’) the eye and visible objects, eye-consciousness arises (<em>uppajjati</em>)” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>II 72</b>). But if it is construed here with the word <em>uppāda</em> (arising), [which is a noun], in a formula of establishment by noun, there is a breach of grammar, because there is no shared subject [as there is in above-quoted sentence], and so it does not establish any meaning al all. So the dependent origination is not simple arising because that is ungrammatical. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.13" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.13" ><b class="bfseries">§13.</b></a></a>  Here it might be [argued]: “We shall add the words ‘comes to be’ (<em>hoti</em>) thus: ‘Having depended, arising comes to be’ (<em>paṭicca, samuppādo hoti</em>).” That will not do. Why not? Because there is no instance in which it has been added, and because the fallacy of the arising of an arising follows. For in such passages as “<em>Paṭiccasamuppādaṃ vo bhikkhave desessāmi. Katamo ca bhikkhave paṭiccasamuppādo … Ayaṃ vuccati bhikkhave paṭiccasamuppādo</em> (I shall teach you the dependent origination, bhikkhus. And what is the dependent origination? … This is called the dependent origination, bhikkhus)” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>II 1</b>), the words “comes to be” (<em>hoti</em>) are not added in any single instance. And there is no [such expression as] “arising comes to be”: if there were, it would be tantamount to saying that arising itself had an arising too. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.14" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.14" ><b class="bfseries">§14.</b></a></a>  And those are wrong who imagine that specific conditionality (<em>idappaccayatā</em>) is the specific conditions’ [abstract] essence—what is called “abstract essence” being a [particular] mode in ignorance, etc., that acts as cause in the manifestation of formations, etc.—and that the term “dependent origination” is used for an alteration in formations when there is that [particular mode in the way of occurrence of ignorance]. Why are they wrong? Because it is ignorance, etc., themselves that are called causes. For in the following passage it is ignorance, etc., themselves, not their alteration, that are called the causes [of these states]: “Therefore, Ānanda, just this is the cause, this is the source, this is the origin, this is the condition, for ageing-and-death, that is to say, birth … for formations, that is to say, (ignorance)” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	<a href="ch-03.html#D" >D</a>
	]
</span>II 57–63</b>—the last clause is not in the Dīgha text). Therefore it is the actual states themselves as conditions that should be understood as “dependent origination.” So what was said above (<a href="ch-24.html#XVII.4" >§4</a>) can be understood as rightly said. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.15" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.15" ><b class="bfseries">§15.</b></a></a>  If any notion arises in the guise of a literal interpretation of the term “dependent origination” (<em>paṭicca-samuppāda</em>) to the effect that it is only arising that is stated, it should be got rid of by apprehending the meaning of this expression in the following way. For: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> In double form this term relates to a totality of state<br /> Produced from a conditionality;<br /> Hence the conditions for that sum<br /> Through metaphor’s device have come<br /> To bear their fruits’ name figuratively<br /> In the Blessed One’s exposition. </blockquote>
<p><a name="XVII.16" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  This term “dependent origination,” when applied to the total of states produced from the [total] conditionality, must be taken in two ways. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[521]</i></span> For <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{595|537}</small></span>that [total] ought to be arrived at (<em>paṭicco—</em>adj.),<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000975">
  <sup class="footnotemark">2</sup>
</a> since when it is arrived at (<em>paṭiyamāno</em>), it leads to [supramundane] welfare and bliss and so the wise [regard] it as worthy to be arrived at (<em>paccetuṃ</em>); and then, when it arises (<em>uppajjamāno</em>), it does so “together with” (<em>saha</em>) and “rightly” (<em>sammā</em>), not singly or causelessly, thus it is a co-arising (<em>samuppādo</em>). Consequently: it is to be arrived at (<em>paṭicco</em>) and it is a co-arising (<em>samuppādo</em>), thus it is dependent origination (<em>paṭicca-samuppāda</em>). Again: it arises as a togetherness (<em>saha</em>), thus it is a co-arising (<em>samuppāda</em>); but it does so having depended (<em>paṭicca—</em>ger.) in combination with conditions, not regardless of them. Consequently: it, having depended (<em>paṭicca</em>), is a co-arising (<em>samuppāda</em>), thus in this way also it is dependent origination (<em>paṭicca-samuppāda</em>). And the total of causes is a condition for that [total of states produced from the conditionality], so, because it is a condition for that, this [total of causes] is called, “dependent origination,” using for it the term ordinarily used for its fruit just as in the world molasses, which is a condition for phlegm, is spoken of thus, “Molasses is phlegm,” or just as in the Dispensation the arising of Buddhas, which is a condition for bliss, is spoken of thus, “The arising of Buddhas is bliss” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XVII.17" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.17" ><b class="bfseries">§17.</b></a></a>  Or alternatively: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> The sum of causes too they call<br /> “Facing its counterpart,” so all<br /> Is in that sense “dependent,” as they tell;<br /> This sum of causes too, as stated,<br /> Gives fruits that rise associated,<br /> So “co-arising” it is called as well. </blockquote>
<p><a name="XVII.18" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.18" ><b class="bfseries">§18.</b></a></a>  This total of causes—indicated severally under the heading of each cause, beginning with ignorance—for the manifestation of formations, etc., is called “dependent” (<em>paṭicco—</em>adj.), taking it as “facing, gone to, its counterpart” (<em>paṭimukham ito</em>) owing to the mutual interdependence of the factors in the combination, in the sense both that they produce common fruit and that none can be dispensed with. And it is called a “co-arising” (<em>samuppādo</em>) since it causes the states that occur in unresolved mutual interdependence to arise associatedly. Consequently: it is dependent (<em>paṭicco</em>) and a co-arising (<em>samuppādo</em>), thus in this way also it is dependent origination (<em>paṭicca-samuppāda</em>). </p>
<p><a name="XVII.19" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.19" ><b class="bfseries">§19.</b></a></a>  Another method: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> This total conditionally, acting interdependently,<br /> Arouses states together equally;<br /> So this too is a reason here wherefore the Greatest Sage, the Seer,<br /> Gave to this term its form thus succinctly. </blockquote>

Because the dependent origination is wholly beneficial and because he has himself acquired elegance in instructing. For the dependent origination is entirely beneficial: starting from any one of the four starting points, it leads only to the penetration of the proper way. And the Blessed One has acquired elegance in instructing: it is because he has done so through possession of the four kinds of perfect confidence and the four discriminations and by achieving the fourfold profundity (<a href="ch-24.html#XVII.304" >§304</a>) that he teaches the Dhamma by various methods. </p>

<p><a name="XVII.35" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.35" ><b class="bfseries">§35.</b></a></a>  Of these methods of presentation, that cited here should be understood to be that stated in forward order starting from the beginning in order to show to people susceptible of teaching who are confused about the laws of the process [of becoming] that the process carries on according to its own peculiar laws, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[525]</i></span> and for the purpose of showing the order of arising. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.36" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.36" ><b class="bfseries">§36.</b></a></a>  But why is ignorance stated as the beginning here? How then, is ignorance the causeless root-cause of the world like the Primordial Essence of those who assert the existence of a Primordial Essence? It is not causeless.

<p><a name="XVII.37" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.37" ><b class="bfseries">§37.</b></a></a>  For the Blessed One gives the exposition of the round with one of two things as the starting point: either ignorance, according as it is said, “No first beginning of ignorance is made known, bhikkhus, before which there was no ignorance, and after which there came to be ignorance.

<p><a name="XVII.38" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.38" ><b class="bfseries">§38.</b></a></a>  But why does the Blessed One give the exposition of the round with those two things as starting points? Because they are the outstanding causes of kamma that leads to happy and unhappy destinies. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.39" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.39" ><b class="bfseries">§39.</b></a></a>  Ignorance is an outstanding cause of kamma that leads to unhappy destinies. Why? Because, just as when a cow to be slaughtered is in the grip of the torment of burning with fire and belabouring with cudgels, and being crazed with torment, she drinks the hot water although it gives no satisfaction and does her harm, so the ordinary man who is in the grip of ignorance performs kamma of the various kinds beginning with killing living things that leads to unhappy destinies, although it gives no satisfaction because of the burning of defilements and does him harm because it casts him into an unhappy destiny. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.40" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.40" ><b class="bfseries">§40.</b></a></a>  But craving for becoming is an outstanding cause of kamma that leads to happy destinies. Why? Because, just as that same cow, through her craving for cold water, starts drinking cold water, which gives satisfaction and allays her torment, so the ordinary man in the grip of craving for becoming performs kamma of the various kinds beginning with abstention from killing living things that leads to happy destinies and gives satisfaction because it is free from the <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{601|543}</small></span>burning of defilements and, by bringing him to a happy destiny, allays the torment of suffering [experienced] in the unhappy destinies. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.41" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.41" ><b class="bfseries">§41.</b></a></a>  Now, as regards these two states that are starting points in expositions of the process [of becoming], in some instances the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma based on a single one of these states, for instance, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[526]</i></span> “Accordingly, bhikkhus, formations have ignorance as their cause, consciousness has formations as its cause” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

Now, this body [with its six internal bases] and externally [the six bases due to] mentality-materiality make a duality. Due to this duality there is contact, as well as the six [pairs of] bases, touched through which the fool feels pleasure and pain” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XVII.43" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.43" ><b class="bfseries">§43.</b></a></a>  <em>2. </em>As to meaning: as to the meaning of the words “ignorance” and so on. Bodily misconduct, etc., for example, “ought not to be found” (<em>avindiya</em>), in the sense of being unfit to be carried out; the meaning is that it should not be permitted. It finds (<em>vindati</em>) what ought not to be found (<em>avindiya</em>), thus it is ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>). Conversely, good bodily conduct, etc. “ought to be found” (<em>vindiya</em>). It does not find (<em>na vindati</em>) what ought to be found (<em>vindiya</em>), thus it is ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>). Also it prevents knowing (<em>avidita</em>) the meaning of collection in the aggregates, the meaning of actuating in the bases, the meaning of voidness in the elements, the meaning of predominance in the faculties, the meaning of reality in the truths, thus it is ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>). Also it prevents knowing the meaning of suffering, etc., described in four ways as “oppression,” etc. (<a href="ch-23.html#XVI.15" >XVI.15</a>), thus it is ignorance. Through all the kinds of generations, destinies, becoming, stations of consciousness, and abodes of beings in the endless round of rebirths it drives beings on (<em>AntaVIrahite saṃsāre … satte JAvāpeti</em>), thus it is ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>). Amongst women, men, etc., which are in the ultimate sense non-existent, it hurries on (<em>paramatthato AVIJjamānesu itthi-purisādisu JAvati</em>), and amongst the aggregates, etc., which are existent, it does not hurry on (<em>vijjamānesu pi khandhādisu na javati</em>), thus it is ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>). Furthermore, it is ignorance because it conceals the physical bases and objects of eye-consciousness, etc., and the dependent origination and dependently-originated states. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.44" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.44" ><b class="bfseries">§44.</b></a></a>  That due to (<em>paṭicca</em>) which fruit comes (<em>eti</em>) is a condition (<em>paccaya</em>). “Due to” (<em>paṭicca</em>) = “not without that”; the meaning is, not dispensing with it. “Comes” (<em>eti</em>) means both “arises” and “occurs.” Furthermore, the meaning of “condition” is the meaning of “help.” It is ignorance and that is a condition, thus it is “ignorance as condition,” whence the phrase “with ignorance as condition.” <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{602|544}</small></span>“They form the formed” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<h2 id="a0000000310">2.3 III. Detailed Exposition</h2>
<p><a name="XVII.58" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.58" ><b class="bfseries">§58.</b></a></a>  This, firstly, is the brief treatment. The following method, however, is in detail. </p>
<h3 id="a0000000311">(1) Ignorance</h3>
<p>According to the Suttanta method <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[530]</i></span> ignorance is unknowing about the four instances beginning with suffering. According to the Abhidhamma method it is unknowing about the eight instances [that is to say, the above-mentioned four] together with [the four] beginning with the past; for this is said: “Herein, what is ignorance? It is unknowing about suffering, [unknowing about the origin of suffering, unknowing about the cessation of suffering, unknowing about the way leading to the cessation of suffering], unknowing about the past, unknowing about the future, unknowing about the past and future, unknowing about specific conditionality and conditionally-arisen states” (cf. <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Dhs" >Dhs</a>
	]
</span>§1162</b>). </p>
<p><a name="XVII.59" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.59" ><b class="bfseries">§59.</b></a></a>  Herein, while ignorance about any instance that is not the two supra-mundane truths can also arise as object (see <a href="ch-24.html#XVII.102" >§102</a>), nevertheless here it is only intended [subjectively] as concealment. For when [thus] arisen it keeps the truth of <em>suffering</em> concealed, preventing penetration of the true individual function and characteristic of that truth. Likewise, origin, cessation, and the path, bygone five aggregates called <em>the past</em>, coming five aggregates called <em>the future</em>, both of these together called <em>the past and future</em>, and both specific conditionality and conditionally-arisen states together called <em>specific conditionality and conditionally-arisen states—</em>all of which it keeps concealed, preventing their true individual <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{606|548}</small></span>functions and characteristics being penetrated thus: “This is ignorance, these are formations.” That is why it is said, “It is unknowing about suffering … unknowing about specific conditionality and conditionally-arisen states.” </p>
<h3 id="a0000000312">(2) Formations</h3>
<p><a name="XVII.60" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.60" ><b class="bfseries">§60.</b></a></a>  <em>Formations</em> are the six mentioned in brief above thus, “the three, namely, formations of merit, etc., and the three, namely, the bodily formation, etc.” (<a href="ch-24.html#XVII.44" >§44</a>); but in detail here the [first] three formations are twenty-nine volitions, that is to say, the formation of merit consisting of thirteen volitions, counting the eight sense-sphere profitable volitions that occur in giving, in virtue, etc., and the five fine-material profitable volitions that occur in development [of meditation]; then the formation of demerit consisting of the twelve unprofitable volitions that occur in killing living things, etc.; then the formation of the imperturbable consisting in the four profitable volitions associated with the immaterial sphere, which occur in development [of those meditations]. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.61" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.61" ><b class="bfseries">§61.</b></a></a>  As regards the other three, the bodily formation is bodily volition, the verbal formation is verbal volition, and the mental formation is mental volition. This triad is mentioned in order to show that at the moment of the accumulation of the kamma the formations of merit, etc., occur in these [three] kamma doors. For the eight sense-sphere profitable and twelve unprofitable volitions, making twenty, are the bodily formation when they occur in the body door and produce bodily intimation. Those same volitions <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[531]</i></span> are called the verbal formation when they occur in the speech door and produce verbal intimation. But volition connected with direct-knowledge is not included here in these two cases because it is not a condition for [resultant rebirth-linking] consciousness later. And like direct-knowledge volition, so also volition connected with agitation is not included; therefore that too should not be included as a condition for [rebirth-linking] consciousness. However, all these have ignorance as their condition. And all the twenty-nine volitions are the mental formation when they arise in the mind door without originating either kind of intimation. So this triad comes within the first triad, and accordingly, as far as the meaning is concerned, ignorance can be understood as condition simply for formations of merit and so on. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.62" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.62" ><b class="bfseries">§62.</b></a></a>  Herein, it might be [asked]: How can it be known that these formations have ignorance as their condition?—By the fact that they exist when ignorance exists. For when unknowing—in other words, ignorance—of suffering, etc., is unabandoned in a man, owing firstly to his unknowing about suffering and about the past, etc., then he believes the suffering of the round of rebirths to be pleasant and he embarks upon the three kinds of formations which are the cause of that very suffering. Owing to his unknowing about suffering’s origin he embarks upon formations that, being subordinated to craving, are actually the cause of suffering, imagining them to be the cause of pleasure. And owing to his unknowing about cessation and the path, he misperceives the cessation of suffering to be in some particular destiny [such as the Brahmā-world] that is not in fact cessation; he misperceives the path to cessation, believing it to consist in sacrifices, mortification for immortality, etc., which are not in fact the path to cessation; and so while aspiring to the cessation of suffering, he embarks upon <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{607|549}</small></span>the three kinds of formations in the form of sacrifices, mortification for immortality, and so on. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.63" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.63" ><b class="bfseries">§63.</b></a></a>  Furthermore, his non-abandonment of that ignorance about the four truths in particular prevents him from recognizing as suffering the kind of suffering called the fruit of merit, which is fraught with the many dangers beginning with birth, ageing, disease and death, and so he embarks upon the formation of merit classed as bodily, verbal, and mental formations, in order to attain that [kind of suffering], like one desiring celestial nymphs [who jumps over] a cliff. Also, not seeing how that fruit of merit reckoned as pleasure eventually breeds great distress owing to the suffering in its change and that it gives little satisfaction, he embarks upon the formation of merit of the kinds already stated, which is the condition for that very [suffering in change], like a moth that falls into a lamp’s flame, and like the man who wants the drop of honey and licks the honey-smeared knife-edge. Also, not seeing the danger in the indulgence of sense desires, etc., with its results, [wrongly] perceiving pleasure and overcome by defilements, he embarks upon the formation of demerit that occurs in the three doors [of kamma], like a child who plays with filth, and like a man who wants to die and eats poison. Also, unaware of the suffering due to formations and the suffering-in-change [inherent] in kamma-results in the immaterial sphere, owing to the perversion of [wrongly perceiving them as] eternal, etc., he embarks upon the formation of the imperturbable which is a mental formation, like one who has lost his way and takes the road to a goblin city. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.64" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.64" ><b class="bfseries">§64.</b></a></a>  So formations exist only when ignorance exists, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[532]</i></span> not when it does not; and that is how it can be known that these formations have ignorance as their condition. </p>
<p>This is said too: “Not knowing, bhikkhus, in ignorance, he forms the formation of merit, forms the formation of demerit, forms the formation of the imperturbable. As soon as a bhikkhu’s ignorance is abandoned and clear vision arisen, bhikkhus, with the fading away of ignorance and the arising of clear vision he does not form even formations of merit” (cf. <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>I 1</b>). </p>
<p><a name="XVII.67" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.67" ><b class="bfseries">§67.</b></a></a>  (1) Herein, it is a root-cause and a condition, thus it is <em>root-cause condition</em>. It is by its being a root-cause that it is a condition; what is meant is that it is a condition owing to its status as root-cause. The same method applies in the case of object condition and the rest. </p>
<p>Herein, “cause” (<em>hetu</em>) is a term for a part of a syllogism, for a reason, and for a root. For with the words “proposition” (<em>paṭiññā</em>), “cause” (<em>hetu</em> = middle term), etc., in the world it is a member of a syllogism (<em>vacanāvayava</em>) that is called a cause. But in the Dispensation, in such passages as “Those states that are produced from a cause” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Vin" >Vin</a>
	]
</span>I 40</b>), it is a reason (<em>kāraṇa</em>); and in such passages as “Three profitable [root-] causes, three unprofitable [root-]causes” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Dhs" >Dhs</a>
	]
</span>§1053</b>), it is a root (<em>mūla</em>) that is called a cause. The last is intended here. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.68" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.68" ><b class="bfseries">§68.</b></a></a>  As to “condition” (<em>paccaya</em>), the word-meaning here is this: It [the fruit] comes from that, depending thereon (<em>paṭicca etasmā eti</em>), thus that is a condition; (<em>paccaya</em>, see note 2) the meaning is, [a state] occurs by not dispensing with that. What is meant is: when a state is indispensable to another state’s presence or arising, the former is a condition for the latter. But as to characteristic, a condition has the characteristic of assisting; for any given state <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[533]</i></span> that assists the presence or arising of a given state is called the latter’s condition. The words condition, cause, reason, source, originator, producer, etc., are one in meaning though different in the letter. So, since it is a cause in the sense of a root, and a condition in the sense of assistance, briefly a state that is assistantial in the sense of a root is a [root-]cause condition. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.69" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.69" ><b class="bfseries">§69.</b></a></a>  The intention of [some] teachers is that it establishes the profitable, etc., state in what is profitable, etc., as paddy seeds, etc., do for paddy, etc., and as the colour of gems, etc., do for the lustre of gems, and so on.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000983">
  <sup class="footnotemark">10</sup>
</a> But if that is so, then [it follows that] the state of root-cause condition does not apply to the kinds of materiality originated by it, for it does not establish any profitableness, etc., in them. Nevertheless, it is a condition for them, for this is said: “Root-causes are a condition, as root-cause condition, for the states associated with a root-cause and for the kinds of materiality originated thereby” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Paṭṭh" >Paṭṭh</a>
	]
</span>I 1</b>). Again, the indeterminateness of root-causeless consciousness is established without it. And the profitableness, etc., of those with root-cause is bound up with wise attention, etc., not with the associated root-causes. And if the profitableness, etc., resided in the associated root-causes as an individual essence, then either the non-greed bound up with the root-cause in the associated states would be only profitable or it would be only indeterminate; but since it can be both, profitableness, etc., in the root-causes must still be sought for, just as in the associated states [such as wise attention, and so on]. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.70" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.70" ><b class="bfseries">§70.</b></a></a>  But when the root-causes’ sense of root is taken as establishing stableness, rather than as establishing profitableness, etc., there is no contradiction. For states that have obtained a root-cause condition are firm, like trees, and stable; <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{609|551}</small></span>but those without root-cause are, like moss [with roots no bigger than] sesame seeds, etc., unstable. So an assistantial state may be understood as a root-cause condition, since it establishes stableness through being of assistance in the sense of a root. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.71" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.71" ><b class="bfseries">§71.</b></a></a>  (2) As to the others that follow, a state that assists by being an object is an <em>object condition</em>. Now, there are no states that are not object conditions; for the passage beginning “The visible-data base [is a condition, as object condition,] for the eye-consciousness element” concludes thus: “When any states, as states of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants, arise contingent upon any states, these [latter] states are conditions, as object condition, for those [former] states” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Paṭṭh" >Paṭṭh</a>
	]
</span>I 1</b>).<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000984">
  <sup class="footnotemark">11</sup>
</a> For just as a weak man both gets up and stands by hanging on to (<em>ālambitvā</em>) a stick or rope, so states of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants always arise and are present contingent upon visible data, etc., as their object (<em>ārammaṇa = ālambana</em>). Therefore all states that are objects of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants should be understood as object condition. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[534]</i></span> </p>
<p><a name="XVII.72" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.72" ><b class="bfseries">§72.</b></a></a>  (3) A state that assists in the sense of being foremost is a <em>predominance condition</em>. It is of two kinds as conascent and as object. Herein, because of the passage beginning “Predominance of zeal is a condition, as predominance condition, for states associated with zeal and for the kinds of materiality originated thereby” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Paṭṭh" >Paṭṭh</a>
	]
</span>I 2</b>), it is the four states called zeal, [purity of] consciousness, energy, and inquiry, that should be understood as predominance condition; but not simultaneously, for when consciousness occurs with emphasis on zeal and putting zeal foremost, then it is zeal and not the others that is predominant. So with the rest. But the state, by giving importance to which, immaterial states occur, is their <em>object-predominance</em>. Hence it is said: “When any states, as states of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants, arise by giving importance to any states, these [latter] states are a condition, as predominance condition, for those [former] states” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XVII.73" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.73" ><b class="bfseries">§73.</b></a></a>  (4), (5) A state that assists by being proximate is a <em>proximity condition</em>. A state that assists by being contiguous is a <em>contiguity condition</em>. The explanation of this pair of conditions is very diffuse, but substantially it is this:<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000985">
  <sup class="footnotemark">12</sup>
</a> the regular order of consciousness begins thus, mind element is proximate (next) after eye-consciousness, mind-consciousness element is proximate (next) after mind element, and this is established only by each preceding consciousness, not otherwise; consequently, a state that is capable of arousing an appropriate kind <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{610|552}</small></span>of consciousness proximate (next) to itself is a proximity condition. Hence it is said: “Proximity condition: eye-consciousness and the states associated therewith are a condition, as proximity condition, for mind element and for the states associated therewith” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XVII.74" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.74" ><b class="bfseries">§74.</b></a></a>  (5) Proximity condition is the same as contiguity condition. The difference here is only in the letter, there is none in the meaning; just as in the case of the words “growth” and “continuity” (<a href="ch-21.html#XIV.66" >XIV.66</a>), etc., and as in the case of the “terminology dyad,” “language dyad,” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XVII.75" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.75" ><b class="bfseries">§75.</b></a></a>  The opinion of [certain] teachers<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000986">
  <sup class="footnotemark">13</sup>
</a> is that proximity condition refers to proximity of aim (fruit) and contiguity condition refers to proximity of time. But that is contradicted by such statements as “The profitable [consciousness] belonging to the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception in one who emerges from cessation is a condition, as contiguity condition, for fruition attainment [consciousness]” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XVII.76" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.76" ><b class="bfseries">§76.</b></a></a>  Now, they say in this context that “the ability of states to produce [their fruit] is not diminished, but the influence of meditative development prevents states from arising in proximity.” But that only establishes that there is no proximity of time; and we also say the same, namely, that there is no proximity of time there owing to the influence of development. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[535]</i></span> But since there is no proximity of time, the state of contiguity condition is therefore impossible [according to them] since their belief is that the contiguity condition depends on proximity of time (cf. <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

There is no interval (<em>antara</em>) between them, thus they are proximate (<em>anantara</em>); they are quite without interval because [even the distinction of] co-presence is lacking, thus they are contiguous (<em>samanantara</em>).<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000987">

So from multiple causes, in other words, from temperature, earth, seed, and moisture, is seen to arise a multiple fruit, in other words, the shoot, which has visible form, odour, taste, and so on. But one representative cause and fruit given in this way, “With ignorance as condition there are formations; with formations as condition, consciousness,” have a meaning and a use. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.107" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.107" ><b class="bfseries">§107.</b></a></a>  For the Blessed One employs one representative cause and fruit when it is suitable for the sake of elegance in instruction and to suit the idiosyncrasies of those susceptible of being taught. And he does so in some instances because it is a basic factor, and in some instances because it is the most obvious, and in some instances because it is not common to all. </p>
<p>In the passage “With contact as condition, feeling” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#M" >M</a>

</span>I 261</b>) he mentions a single cause and fruit because they are basic factors. For contact is the basic cause of feeling since the kinds of feeling are defined according to the kinds of contact [as “eye-contact-born feeling” and so on], and feeling is contact’s basic fruit since contact is defined according to the kinds of feeling [that it produces]. He mentions a single cause in the passage “Disease due to phlegm” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#A" >A</a>

</span>V 110</b>) because that is the most obvious. For here what is obvious is the phlegm, not the kamma, etc., [mentioned later in the same sutta]. He mentions a single cause in the passage “Bhikkhus, any states whatever that are unprofitable are all rooted in unwise attention” (cf. <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>

<p><a name="XVII.108" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.108" ><b class="bfseries">§108.</b></a></a>  Consequently, although other causes of formations such as physical basis and object, conascent states, etc., are actually existent, still ignorance may be understood as the representative cause of formations [firstly] because it is the basic factor as the cause of other causes of formations such as craving, etc., as it is said: “Craving increases in one who dwells seeing enjoyment” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XVII.110" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.110" ><b class="bfseries">§110.</b></a></a>  It is established in the world that when states have a condition, it may be opposed or unopposed to them as to presence, individual essence, function, and so on. For a preceding consciousness is a condition, opposed as to presence, for the succeeding consciousness; and the preceding training is a condition likewise for the plying of crafts, etc., which take place subsequently. Kamma is a condition, opposed as to individual essence, for materiality; and so are milk, etc., for curds, and so on. Light is a condition, opposed as to function, for eye-consciousness; and so are molasses, etc., for intoxicants, and so on. But eye-cum-visible-data, etc., are respectively a condition, unopposed as to presence, for eye-consciousness, and so on. And the first impulsion, and those that follow, are a condition, unopposed as to individual essence and function, for the impulsions that follow them. And just as conditions operate as opposed and unopposed, so also they operate as like and unlike. Materiality—for example, temperature and nutriment—is a condition for materiality: the like for the like. And so are paddy seeds, etc., for paddy crops, and so on. The material is a condition for the immaterial, and so is the immaterial for the material: the unlike for the like.

<p><a name="XVII.111" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.111" ><b class="bfseries">§111.</b></a></a>  So although this ignorance has entirely undesirable fruit for its result and is reprehensible in its individual essence, yet it should be understood as a condition, opposed or unopposed and like or unlike as the case may be, as to presence, function, and individual essence, for all these formations of merit, etc. And its state as a condition has already been given in the way beginning, “For when unknowing—in other words, ignorance—of suffering, etc., is unabandoned in a man, owing firstly to his unknowing about suffering and about the past, etc., then be believes the suffering of the round of rebirths to be pleasant <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{620|562}</small></span>and he embarks upon the three kinds of formations, which are the cause of that very suffering” (<a href="ch-24.html#XVII.62" >§62</a>). </p>

<h3 id="a0000000313">(3) Consciousness</h3>
<p>[<span class="scshape"><b class="bfseries">1. Kinds of Mundane Resultant Consciousness</b></span>] </p>
<p><a name="XVII.120" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.120" ><b class="bfseries">§120.</b></a></a>  In the clause, <em>with formations as condition, consciousness</em>, consciousness is sixfold as eye-consciousness, and so on. Herein, eye-consciousness is twofold, namely, profitable [kamma-]resultant and unprofitable [kamma-]resultant (see Table II for bracketed numbers that follow). Likewise ear-, nose-, tongue-, and body-consciousness ((34)–(38) and (50)–(54)). But mind-consciousness is twenty-two-fold, namely, the two profitable and unprofitable resultant mind elements ((39) and (55)), the three root-causeless mind-consciousness elements ((40), (41) and (56)), the eight sense-sphere resultant consciousnesses with root-cause ((42)–(49)), the five of the fine-material sphere ((57)–(61)), and the four of the immaterial sphere ((62)–(65)). So all the thirty-two mundane resultant consciousnesses ((34)–(65)) are included by these six kinds of consciousness. But the supramundane kinds do not belong to the exposition of the round [of becoming], and so they are not included. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.121" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.121" ><b class="bfseries">§121.</b></a></a>  Here it may be asked: “But how is it to be known that this consciousness of the kind stated actually has formations as its condition?”—Because there is no kamma-result when there is no stored-up kamma. For this consciousness is kamma-result, and kamma-result does not arise in the absence of stored-up kamma. If it did, then all kinds of kamma-resultant consciousnesses would arise in all kinds of beings, and they do not do so. This is how it should be known that such consciousness has formations as its condition. </p>

<p>Now, this resultant consciousness all occurs in two ways, namely, (a) in the course of an individual existence (or continuity), and (b) at the rebirth-linking [moment]. </p>
<p>Herein, there are the two fivefold consciousnesses ((34)–(38) and (50)–(54)), two mind elements ((39) and (55)), and root-causeless mind-consciousness <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{623|565}</small></span>element accompanied by joy (40), that is, thirteen which occur only in the course of an existence in the five-constituent kind of becoming.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000993">
  <sup class="footnotemark">20</sup>
</a> The remaining nineteen occur in the three kinds of becoming, either in the course of an existence or at rebirth-linking, as appropriate. How? </p>
<p>[<em><b class="bfseries">2a. In the Course of an Existence</b></em>] </p>
<p><a name="XVII.127" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.127" ><b class="bfseries">§127.</b></a></a>  Firstly, in one who has been reborn by means of either profitable-result or unprofitable result: according as his faculties mature, so the five profitable-resultant eye-, etc., consciousnesses occur accomplishing the respective functions of <em>seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching</em> ((d)–(h)), contingent respectively upon a desirable or desirable-neutral visible datum, etc., as object that has come into the focus of the eye, etc., and having the sensitivity of the eye, etc., as [material] support. And likewise the five unprofitable-resultant consciousnesses; the only difference being this, that the visible data, etc., as object for these are undesirable or undesirable-neutral. And these ten are invariable as to their door, object, physical basis, and position [in the cognitive series], and invariable as to their functions. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.128" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.128" ><b class="bfseries">§128.</b></a></a>  After that, next to the profitable-resultant eye-, etc., consciousness, the profitable-resultant mind element (39) occurs accomplishing the function of <em>receiving</em> (i), contingent upon the same object as that of the former, and having the heart-basis as support. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[547]</i></span> And next after the unprofitable-resultant eye-, etc., consciousness, the unprofitable-resultant mind element (55) occurs likewise. But these two, while variable as to door and object, are invariable as to physical basis and position, and invariable as to function. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.129" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.129" ><b class="bfseries">§129.</b></a></a>  Then next to the profitable-resultant mind element, the root-causeless mind-consciousness element accompanied by joy (40) occurs accomplishing the function of <em>investigation</em> (j), contingent upon the same object as that of the mind element, and having the heart-basis as support. And when the object is a vivid one in any of the six doors belonging to sense-sphere beings, usually at the end of impulsions associated with greed it holds up the [renewal of the] course of the life-continuum (b) by occurring either once or twice as <em>registration </em>(m), having the same object as that apprehended by the impulsions—so it is said in the Majjhima Commentary.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000994">
  <sup class="footnotemark">21</sup>
</a> But in the Abhidhamma Commentary two turns of consciousness have been handed down with respect to registration. This consciousness has two names, “registration” (<em>tad-ārammaṇa—</em>lit. <em>having that object </em>that the preceding impulsions had) and “aftermath life-continuum” (<em>piṭṭhi-bhavaṅga—</em>see <a href="ch-21.html#XIV.122" >XIV.122</a>). It is variable as to door and object, it is invariable as to physical basis, and it is variable as to position and function. <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{624|566}</small></span>This, in the first place, it should be understood, is how thirteen kinds of consciousness occur only in the course of an individual existence in the five-constituent kind of becoming. </p>

But in the course of an individual existence, firstly, two, namely, profitable-resultant and unprofitable-resultant root-causeless mind-consciousness elements ((41) and (56)) occur accomplishing four functions, that is to say, the function of <em>investigating </em>in the five doors (j) next after profitable-resultant and unprofitable-resultant mind element, the function of <em>registration</em> (m) in the six doors in the way already stated, the function of <em>life-continuum</em> (b) that continues after rebirth-linking given by themselves, as long as there is no thought-arising to interrupt the life-continuum, and lastly the function of <em>death</em> (n) at the end [of the course of an existence]. And so these two are invariable as to [possession of heart-] basis, and variable as to door, object, position, and function. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.131" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.131" ><b class="bfseries">§131.</b></a></a>  The eight sense-sphere consciousnesses with root-cause ((42)–(49)) occur accomplishing three functions, namely, the function of <em>registration</em> (m) in the six doors in the way already stated, the function of <em>life-continuum</em> (b) after rebirth-linking given by themselves, as long as there is no thought-arising to interrupt the life-continuum, and lastly the function of death (n) at the end. And they are invariable as to [possession of heart-] basis, and variable as to door, position, and function. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.132" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.132" ><b class="bfseries">§132.</b></a></a>  The five fine-material consciousnesses ((57)–(61)) and the four immaterial consciousnesses ((62)–(65)) occur accomplishing two functions, namely, the function of <em>life-continuum</em> (b) that continues after rebirth-linking given by themselves, as long as there is no thought-arising to interrupt the life-continuum, and the function of <em>death</em> (n) at the end. As regards these, those of the fine-material sphere are invariable as to [possession of heart-]basis and as to their object, and they are variable as to position and function, while the others occur invariably without [heart-] basis, and they are invariable as to object, and variable as to position and function. </p>
<p>This, in the first place, is how the thirty-twofold resultant consciousness occurs in the course of an individual existence with formations as condition. And there [in the course of an existence] these several formations are conditions, as kamma condition and decisive-support condition, for this [thirty-twofold resultant consciousness]. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[548]</i></span> </p>

Hence, in order to show the details it may be asked: (i) How many kinds of rebirth-linking are there? (ii) How many kinds of rebirth-linking consciousness? (iii) Where and by what means does rebirth-linking come about? (iv) What does rebirth-linking [consciousness] have as its object? </p>

Rebirth-linking by means of the eight principal resultant consciousnesses with root-cause ((42)–(49)) comes about among deities of the sense sphere and the meritorious among men. That by means of the five fine-material resultant kinds comes about in the fine-material Brahmā-world. That by means of the four immaterial-sphere resultant kinds comes about in the immaterial world. So rebirth-linking [consciousness] conforms to the means by which, and the place in which, it comes about. </p>
<p>(iv) Briefly, rebirth-linking [consciousness] has three kinds of objects, namely, past, present, and not-so-classifiable (see <a href="ch-09.html#III.n32" >Ch. III, n. 32</a>). Non-percipient rebirth-linking [consciousness] has no object. </p>

That of the ten kinds of sense-sphere rebirth-linking is <em>past</em> or <em>present</em>. That of the rest is <em>not-so-classifiable</em>. But while the rebirth-linking consciousness occurs thus with three kinds of objects, the death consciousness, next to which it occurs, has only a past or a not-so-classifiable object, there being no death consciousness with a present object. Consequently, it should be understood how it occurs in the happy destinies and the unhappy destinies as follows, that is to say, how rebirth-linking consciousness with one of three kinds of objects occurs next to death consciousness with one of two kinds of objects. </p>

</a> there. The formative processes of seeds establish the meaning of this. For once the formative processes of a mango seed, etc., have been set afoot, when the particular fruit arises in the continuity of the seed’s [growth], later on owing to the obtaining of conditions, it does so neither as the fruit of other seeds nor from other formative processes as condition; and those seeds or formative processes do not themselves pass on to the place where the fruit is. This is the analogy here. And the meaning can also be understood from the fact that the arts, crafts, medicine, etc., learnt in youth give their fruit later on in maturity. </p>

<p><a name="XVII.203" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.203" ><b class="bfseries">§203.</b></a></a>  As to the clause “With mentality-materiality as condition, the sixfold base”: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> Three aggregates are “mind”; the basis,<br /> Primaries, and the rest are “matter”:<br /> And while all that conditions this<br /> A part can represent the rest. </blockquote>
<p><a name="XVII.204" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.204" ><b class="bfseries">§204.</b></a></a>  In the case of the mentality-materiality that is here a condition for the sixfold base, mentality is the three aggregates beginning with feeling, while materiality should be understood as that included in one’s own continuity stated thus “primaries and the rest are ‘matter’,” that is to say, the four primaries, six physical bases, and life faculty, [since they are conditioning factors] invariably. But this mentality and this materiality and this mentality-materiality, each one representing the rest as “mentality-materiality,” should be understood as a condition for the sixfold base consisting of the sixth base and the sixfold base each one representing the rest as the “sixfold base.” Why? Because in the immaterial becoming there is only mentality as a condition, and that is a condition only for the sixth base, [namely, the mind base,] not for any other. For it is said in the Vibhaṅga, “With mentality as condition, the sixth base” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

For a given base exists when a given kind of mentality and materiality exists, not otherwise. But the way in which the one comes to exist when the other does will be explained below in the section dealing with how it is a condition. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[563]</i></span> Therefore: </p>

<p><a name="XVII.207" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.207" ><b class="bfseries">§207.</b></a></a>  How? In rebirth-linking, firstly, mentality is a condition in seven ways at the minimum, as conascence, mutuality, support, association, kamma-result, presence, and non-disappearance conditions, for the sixth base. Some mentality, however, is a condition, as root-cause condition [that is, greed, etc.,] and some as nutriment condition [that is, contact and mental volition]. So it is also a condition in other ways. It is by the [two latter] that the maximum and minimum should be understood. In the course of an existence, too, resultant mentality is a condition as already stated. But the other [non-resultant] kind is a condition in six ways at minimum, as the aforesaid conditions except for kamma-result condition. Some, however, are a condition, as root-cause condition, and some as nutriment condition. So it is also a condition in other ways. It is by these that the maximum and minimum should be understood. </p>

But in association with the four primary elements, it is a condition in six ways, as conascence, support, kamma-result, dissociation, presence, and non-disappearance conditions, for the other five beginning with the eye base. Some, however, are a condition as root-cause condition, and some as nutriment condition. It is by these that the maximum and minimum should be understood. </p>

<p><a name="XVII.211" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.211" ><b class="bfseries">§211.</b></a></a>  For, as in rebirth-linking, so also in the course of an existence in the five-constituent becoming, resultant mentality is a condition in the seven ways at minimum for the resultant sixth base. But non-resultant mentality is a condition in six ways at minimum for the non-resultant sixth base, leaving out kamma-result condition.

<p><a name="XVII.213" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.213" ><b class="bfseries">§213.</b></a></a>  Again, in the course of an existence, the other resultant mentality, which has as its physical basis the eye sensitivity, etc., is a condition in four ways, as postnascence, dissociation, presence, and non-disappearance conditions, for the rest of the five beginning with the eye base. And as the resultant, so also the non-resultant is explained; therefore [the mentality] classed as profitable, etc., should be understood as their condition in four ways. </p>
<p>This, firstly, is how it should be understood what bases mentality alone is a condition for in rebirth-linking and in the course of an existence, and how it is a condition. </p>

Nutriment too is a condition in three ways, as presence, non-disappearance, and nutriment conditions, and that is so in the course of an existence, not in rebirth-linking, and applies when the bodies of beings subsisting on nutriment are suffused with the nutriment. In the course of an existence, not in rebirth-linking, those five bases beginning with the eye are conditions in six ways, as support, prenascence, faculty, dissociation, presence and non-disappearance conditions, for [that part of] the sixth, the mind base, comprising eye-, ear-, nose-, tongue-, and body-consciousness. But in the course of an existence, not at rebirth-linking, the materiality of the [heart-]<span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{644|586}</small></span> basis is a condition in five ways, as support, prenascence, dissociation, presence, and non-disappearance conditions, for the remaining mind base apart from the five consciousnesses.

<h3 id="a0000000316">(6) Contact</h3>
<p><a name="XVII.220" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.220" ><b class="bfseries">§220.</b></a></a>  As to the clause “With the sixfold base as condition, contact”: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> Contact is briefly of six kinds<br /> With eye-contact and others too;<br /> According to each consciousness<br /> It is in detail thirty-two. </blockquote>
<p><a name="XVII.221" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.221" ><b class="bfseries">§221.</b></a></a>  Briefly, with the clause “With the sixfold base as condition, contact,” there are only the six kinds beginning with eye-contact, that is to say, eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and mind-contact. But in detail the five profitable resultant and the five unprofitable resultant beginning with eye-contact make ten; the rest, which are associated with the twenty-two kinds of mundane resultant consciousness, make twenty-two. So all these come to thirty-two ((34)–(65)), like the consciousness with formations as condition given above. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.222" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.222" ><b class="bfseries">§222.</b></a></a>  But as to the sixfold base that is a condition for this thirty-twofold contact. Herein: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> Some wise men take the sixfold base<br /> To be the five internal bases<br /> With the sixth; but others count<br /> These plus the six external bases. </blockquote>
<p><a name="XVII.223" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.223" ><b class="bfseries">§223.</b></a></a>  Herein, firstly, there are those who take this to be an exposition of the occurrence of what is clung to, [that is, kammically-acquired aggregates,] and they maintain that the conditioning [bases] and the conditionally-arisen [contact] are only what is included in one’s own continuity. They take any one part to <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{645|587}</small></span>represent any remaining one of its kind, since the condition for contact in the immaterial states is the sixth base [only], according to the text “With the sixth base as condition, contact” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Vibh" >Vibh</a>
	]
</span>179</b>), and elsewhere it is the sixfold base inclusively. So they have it that “sixfold base” means the internal [five] beginning with the eye plus the sixth (mind) base. For that sixth base and that sixfold base are styled “sixfold base.” But there are those who maintain that it is only the conditionally-arisen [contact] that is contained in a single continuity, while the conditioning [bases] are contained in separate [that is, past] continuities as well. They maintain that all and any such bases are a condition for contact, and they include also the [six] external ones. So they have it that “sixfold base” means the same internal [five] plus the sixth plus the external ones beginning with visible data. For that sixth base and that [partial] sixfold base and the sixfold base along with these [external ones] each representing the rest <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[566]</i></span> are styled sixfold base too. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.224" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.224" ><b class="bfseries">§224.</b></a></a>  Here it may be asked: “One kind of contact does not derive from all the bases, nor all the kinds of contact from one base. And yet ‘With the sixfold base as condition, contact’ is said in the singular. Why is that?” </p>
<p><a name="XVII.225" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.225" ><b class="bfseries">§225.</b></a></a>  Here is the answer: It is true that neither is one derived from all nor all from one. However, one is derived from many. For eye-contact is derived from the eye base, from the visible-data base, from the mind base reckoned as eye-consciousness, and from the mental-datum base consisting of the remaining associated states. And each case should be construed as appropriate in this way. Therefore: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> Though stated in the singular,<br /> He shows therewith in all such cases<br /> That this contact, though only one,<br /> Is yet derived from several bases. </blockquote>
<p><em>Though stated in the singular</em>: the meaning is, by this statement in the singular that “With the sixfold base as condition, contact,” it is pointed out by the Blessed One (<em>Tādin</em>) that contact, which is of one kind, comes into being from many bases. </p>

<p><a name="XVII.227" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.227" ><b class="bfseries">§227.</b></a></a>  Here is the explanation: firstly, the five consisting of the eye base, etc., are conditions in six ways, as support, prenascence, faculty, dissociation, presence, and non-disappearance conditions, for contact classed in five ways as eye-contact, and so on. After that, the single resultant mind base is a condition in nine ways, as conascence, mutuality, support, result, nutriment, faculty, association, presence, and non-disappearance conditions, for the variously-classed<span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{646|588}</small></span> resultant mind contact. But in the case of the external bases, the visible-data base is a condition in four ways, as object, prenascence, presence, and non-disappearance conditions, for eye-contact. Likewise the sound base, etc., respectively for ear-contact, and so on. But these and mental data as object are conditions likewise, and as object condition too, for mind-contact, so “the external six as contact’s conditionality according to each case we fix.” </p>

But that contact beginning with eye-contact is a condition in one way only, as decisive-support condition, for the rest of resultant feeling in the sense sphere occurring in each door as receiving, investigation and registration. </p>

<h3 id="a0000000318">(8) Craving</h3>

<p><a name="XVII.234" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.234" ><b class="bfseries">§234.</b></a></a>  Six kinds of craving are shown in the analysis of this clause [in the Vibhaṅga] as “visible-data craving, sound, odour, flavour, tangible-data, and mental-data craving” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	<a href="ch-03.html#Vibh" >Vibh</a>

</span>136</b>), called after their objects, as a son is called after his father “banker’s son,” “brahman’s son.” Each of these six kinds of craving is reckoned threefold according to its mode of occurrence as craving for sense desires, craving for becoming, or craving for non-becoming. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.235" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.235" ><b class="bfseries">§235.</b></a></a>  When visible-data craving occurs enjoying with sense-desire enjoyment a visible datum as object that has come into the focus of the eye, it is called craving for sense desires. But when [that same visible-data craving] occurs along with the eternity view that assumes that same object to be lasting and eternal, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[568]</i></span> it is called craving for becoming; for it is the greed accompanying the eternity view that is called craving for becoming. When it occurs along with the annihilation view that assumes that same object to break up and be destroyed, it is called craving for non-becoming; for it is the greed accompanying the annihilation view that is called craving for non-becoming. So also in the case of craving for sounds, and so on. </p>
<p>These amount to eighteen kinds of craving.

But some have said: Craving is the aspiring to an object that one has not yet reached, like a thief’s stretching out his hand in the dark; clinging is the grasping of an object that one has reached, like the thief’s grasping his objective. These states oppose fewness of wishes and contentment and so they are the roots of the suffering due to seeking and guarding (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

[False-] view clinging is the ten-based wrong view, according as it is said: “Herein what is [false-] view clinging?

Herein, order of arising of <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{650|592}</small></span>defilements is not meant literally because there is no first arising of defilements in the beginningless round of rebirths. But in a relative sense it is this: usually in a single becoming the misinterpretation of (insistence on) eternity and annihilation are preceded by the assumption of a self. After that, when a man assumes that this self is eternal, rules-and-vows clinging arises in him for the purpose of purifying the self. And when a man assumes that it breaks up, thus disregarding the next world, sense-desire clinging arises in him. So self-doctrine clinging arises first, and after that, [false-] view clinging, and rules-and-vows clinging or sense-desire clinging. This, then, is their order of arising in one becoming. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.245" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.245" ><b class="bfseries">§245.</b></a></a>  And here [false-] view clinging, etc., are abandoned first because they are eliminated by the path of stream-entry.

For it has a broad objective field because it is associated with eight kinds of consciousness ((22)–(29)). The others have a narrow objective field because they are associated with four kinds of consciousness ((22), (23), (26) and (27)). And usually it is sense-desire clinging that is obvious because of this generation’s love of attachment (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

  <sup class="footnotemark">42</sup>
</a> And that is then divided in two as rules-and-vows clinging and self-doctrine clinging. And of these two, rules-and-vows clinging is taught first, being gross, because it can be recognized on seeing [it in the forms of] ox practice and dog practice. And self-doctrine clinging is taught last because of its subtlety. This is the “order of teaching.” </p>

<p>Now, these states come about with the arising of cankers, and so when they are established, they establish the cankers which are the cause of ignorance. And when the cankers are established, ignorance is also established because it is present when its condition is present. This, in the first place, is how ignorance, etc., should be understood to be established by sorrow and so on. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.280" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.280" ><b class="bfseries">§280.</b></a></a>  <em>2. </em>But when ignorance is established since it is present when its condition is present, and when “with ignorance as condition there are formations; with formations as condition, consciousness,” there is no end to the succession of cause with fruit in this way. Consequently, the Wheel of Becoming with its twelve factors, revolving with the linking of cause and effect, is established as having “no known beginning.” </p>
<p><a name="XVII.281" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.281" ><b class="bfseries">§281.</b></a></a>  This being so, are not the words “With ignorance as condition there are formations,” as an exposition of a simple beginning, contradicted?—This is not an exposition of a simple beginning. It is an exposition of a basic state (see <a href="ch-24.html#XVII.107" >§107</a>). For ignorance is the basic state for the three rounds (see <a href="ch-24.html#XVII.298" >§298</a>). It is owing to his seizing ignorance that the fool gets caught in the round of the remaining defilements, in the rounds of kamma, etc., just as it is owing to seizing a snake’s head that the arm gets caught in [the coils of] the rest of the snake’s body. But when the cutting off of ignorance is effected, he is liberated from them just as the arm caught [in the coils] is liberated when the snake’s head is cut off, according as it is said, “With the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

Or the first has the purpose of eliminating the annihilation view because, by the evidence of the fruit, it proves that there is no annihilation of the causes; and the second has the purpose of eliminating the eternity view because it proves the ageing and death of whatever has arisen.

So this Wheel of Becoming should be known “as to prevention” of wrong seeing appropriately in each instance. </p>
<p><a name="XVII.303" ><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.303" ><b class="bfseries">§303.</b></a></a>  <em>4.

<p>Or again, ignorance here as “no theory” and “wrong theory” (see <a href="ch-24.html#XVII.52" >§52</a>) befogs beings as a cataract does the eyes; the fool befogged by it involves himself in formations that produce further becoming, as a cocoon-spinning caterpillar does <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{663|605}</small></span>with the strands of the cocoon; consciousness guided by formations establishes itself in the destinies, as a prince guided by a minister establishes himself on a throne; [death] consciousness conjecturing about the sign of rebirth generates mentality-materiality in its various aspects in rebirth-linking, as a magician does an illusion; the sixfold base planted in mentality-materiality reaches growth, increase and fulfilment, as a forest thicket does planted in good soil; contact is born from the impingement of the bases, as fire is born from the rubbing together of fire sticks; feeling is manifested in one touched by contact, as burning is in one touched by fire; craving increases in one who feels, as thirst does in one who drinks salt water; one who is parched [with craving] conceives longing for the kinds of becoming, as a thirsty man does for drinks; that is his clinging; by clinging he clings to becoming as a fish does to the hook through greed for the bait; when there is becoming there is birth, as when there is a seed there is a shoot; and death is certain for one who is born, as falling down is for a tree that has grown up. </p>

The perhaps unorthodox form “uninterest” has been used to avoid the “unselfish” sense sometimes implied by “disinterestedness.” <em>Vyāpāra </em>is clearly intended throughout this work as “motivated action” in contrast with “blind action of natural forces.” The word “interest” has therefore been chosen to bring out this effect.</li>
  <li id="a0000001021"><a name="XVII.n48" ></a><a href="ch-24.html#XVII.n48" ><sup>¶</sup></a> The dependent origination, or structure of conditions, appears as a flexible formula with the intention of describing the ordinary human situation of a man in his world (or indeed any conscious event where ignorance and craving have not entirely ceased). That situation is always complex, since it is implicit that consciousness with no object, or being (<em>bhava—</em>becoming, or however rendered) without consciousness (of it), is impossible except as an artificial abstraction. The dependent origination, being designed to portray the essentials of that situation in the limited dimensions of words and using only elements recognizable in experience, is not a logical proposition (Descartes’ <em>cogito </em>is not a logical proposition). Nor is it a temporal cause-and-effect chain: each member has to be examined as to its nature in order to determine what its relations to the others are (e.g. whether successive in time or conascent, positive or negative, etc., etc.). A purely cause-and-effect chain would not represent the pattern of a situation that is always complex, always subjective-objective, static-dynamic, positive-negative, and so on. Again, there is no evidence of any historical development in the various forms given <em>within the limit of the Sutta Piṭaka </em>(leaving aside the Paṭisambhidāmagga), and historical treatment within that particular limit is likely to mislead, if it is hypothesis with no foundation. 
Parallels with European thought have been avoided in this translation. But perhaps an exception can be made here, with due caution, in the case of Descartes. The revolution in European thought started by his formula <em>cogito ergo sum </em>(“I think, therefore I am”) is not yet ended. Now, it will perhaps not escape notice that the two elements, “I think” and “I am,” in what is not a logical proposition parallel to some extent the two members of the dependent origination, consciousness and being (becoming). In other words, consciousness activated by craving and clinging as the dynamic factory, guided and blinkered by ignorance (“I think” or “consciousness with the conceit ‘I am’”), conditions being (“therefore I am”) in a complex relationship with other factors relating subject and object (not accounted for by Descartes). The parallel should not be pushed too far. In fact it is only introduced because in Europe the dependent origination seems to be very largely misunderstood with many strange interpretations placed upon it, and because the <em>cogito </em>does seem to offer some sort of reasonable approach. In this work, for convenience because of the special importance attached here to the aspect of the death-rebirth link, the dependent origination is considered from only one standpoint, namely, as applicable to a period embracing a minimum of three lives. But this is not the only application. With suitable modifications it is also used in the Vibhaṅga to describe the structure of the complex in each one of the 89 single type-consciousnesses laid down in the <em>Dhammasaṅgaṇī</em>; and Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa says: “This structure of conditions is present not only in (a continuity period consisting of) multiple consciousnesses but also in each single consciousness as well” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Vibh-a" >Vibh-a</a>
	]
</span>199–200</b>). Also the Paṭisambhidāmagga gives five expositions, four describing dependent origination in one life, the fifth being made to present a special inductive generalization to extend what is observable in this life (the fact that consciousness is always preceded by consciousness, cf. this Ch. §83f.—i.e. that it always has a past and is inconceivable without one) back beyond birth, and (since craving and ignorance ensure its expected continuance) on after death. There are, besides, various other, differing applications indicated by the variant forms given in the suttas themselves.</li>
