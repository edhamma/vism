<h1 id="a0000000180">1 (7) Mindfulness of Death</h1>
<p><a name="VIII.1" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.1" ><b class="bfseries">§1.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{283|225}</small></span><span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[229]</i></span> Now comes the description of the development of mindfulness of death, which was listed next (<a href="ch-09.html#III.105" >III.105</a>). </p>
<h2 id="a0000000181">1.1 Definitions</h2>
<p>Herein, <em>death </em>(<em>maraṇa</em>) is the interruption of the life faculty included within [the limits of] a single becoming (existence). But death as termination (cutting off), in other words, the Arahant’s termination of the suffering of the round, is not intended here, nor is momentary death, in other words, the momentary dissolution of formations, nor the “death” of conventional (metaphorical) usage in such expressions as “dead tree,” “dead metal,” and so on. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.2" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.2" ><b class="bfseries">§2.</b></a></a>  As intended here it is of two kinds, that is to say, timely death and untimely death. Herein, <em>timely death </em>comes about with the exhaustion of merit or with the exhaustion of a life span or with both. <em>Untimely death </em>comes about through kamma that interrupts [other, life-producing] kamma. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.3" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.3" ><b class="bfseries">§3.</b></a></a>  Herein, death through <em>exhaustion of merit </em>is a term for the kind of death that comes about owing to the result of [former] rebirth-producing kamma’s having finished ripening although favourable conditions for prolonging the continuity of a life span may be still present. Death through <em>exhaustion of a life span </em>is a term for the kind of death that comes about owing to the exhaustion of the normal life span of men of today, which measures only a century owing to want of such excellence in destiny [as deities have] or in time [as there is at the beginning of an aeon] or in nutriment [as the Uttarakurus and so on have].<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000644">
  <sup class="footnotemark">1</sup>
</a> <em>Untimely death </em>is a term for the death of those whose continuity is interrupted by kamma capable of causing them to fall (<em>cāvana</em>) from their place at that very moment, as in the case of Dūsi-Māra (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#M" >M</a>
	]
</span>I 337</b>), Kalāburājā (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#J-a" >J-a</a>
	]
</span>III 39</b>), etc.,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000645">
  <sup class="footnotemark">2</sup>
</a> or for the death of those whose [life’s] continuity is interrupted by assaults with weapons, etc., due to previous kamma. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[230]</i></span> All these are included under the interruption of <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{284|226}</small></span>the life faculty of the kinds already stated. So mindfulness of death is the remembering of death, in other words, of the interruption of the life faculty. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000182">1.2 Development</h2>
<p><a name="VIII.4" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  One who wants to develop this should go into solitary retreat and exercise attention wisely in this way: “Death will take place; the life faculty will be interrupted,” or “Death, death.” </p>
<p><a name="VIII.5" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.5" ><b class="bfseries">§5.</b></a></a>  If he exercises his attention unwisely in recollecting the [possible] death of an agreeable person, sorrow arises, as in a mother on recollecting the death of her beloved child she bore; and gladness arises in recollecting the death of a disagreeable person, as in enemies on recollecting the death of their enemies; and no sense of urgency arises on recollecting the death of neutral people, as happens in a corpse-burner on seeing a dead body; and anxiety arises on recollecting one’s own death, as happens in a timid person on seeing a murderer with a poised dagger. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.6" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.6" ><b class="bfseries">§6.</b></a></a>  In all that there is neither mindfulness nor sense of urgency nor knowledge. So he should look here and there at beings that have been killed or have died, and advert to the death of beings already dead but formerly seen enjoying good things, doing so with mindfulness, with a sense of urgency and with knowledge, after which he can exercise his attention in the way beginning, “Death will take place.” By so doing he exercises it wisely. He exercises it as a [right] means, is the meaning.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000646">
  <sup class="footnotemark">3</sup>
</a> </p>
<p><a name="VIII.7" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.7" ><b class="bfseries">§7.</b></a></a>  When some exercise it merely in this way, their hindrances get suppressed, their mindfulness becomes established with death as its object, and the meditation subject reaches access. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000183">1.3 Eight ways of recollecting death</h2>
<p><a name="VIII.8" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.8" ><b class="bfseries">§8.</b></a></a>  But one who finds that it does not get so far should do his recollecting of death in eight ways, that is to say: (1) as having the appearance of a murderer, (2) as the ruin of success, (3) by comparison, (4) as to sharing the body with many, (5) as to the frailty of life, (6) as signless, (7) as to the limitedness of the extent, (8) as to the shortness of the moment. </p>
<h3 id="a0000000184">Having the appearance of a murderer</h3>
<p><a name="VIII.9" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.9" ><b class="bfseries">§9.</b></a></a>  <em>1.</em> Herein, <em>as having the appearance of a murderer</em>: he should do his recollecting thus, “Just as a murderer appears with a sword, thinking, ‘I shall cut this man’s head off,’ and applies it to his neck, so death appears.” Why? Because it comes with birth and it takes away life. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.10" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.10" ><b class="bfseries">§10.</b></a></a>  As budding toadstools always come up lifting dust on their tops, so beings are born along with aging and death. For accordingly their rebirth-linking consciousness reaches aging immediately next to its arising and then breaks up together with its associated aggregates, like a stone that falls from the summit of a rock. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[231]</i></span> So to begin with, momentary death comes along with birth. But death is inevitable for what is born; consequently the kind of death intended here also comes along with birth. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.11" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.11" ><b class="bfseries">§11.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{285|227}</small></span>Therefore, just as the risen sun moves on towards its setting and never turns back even for a little while from wherever it has got to, or just as a mountain torrent sweeps by with a rapid current, ever flowing and rushing on and never turning back even for a little while, so too this living being travels on towards death from the time when he is born, and he never turns back even for a little while. Hence it is said: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> “Right from the very day a man<br /> Has been conceived inside a womb<br /> He cannot but go on and on,<br /> Nor going can he once turn back” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#J-a" >J-a</a>
	]
</span>IV 494</b>). </blockquote>
<p><a name="VIII.12" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.12" ><b class="bfseries">§12.</b></a></a>  And whilst he goes on thus death is as near to him as drying up is to rivulets in the summer heat, as falling is to the fruits of trees when the sap reaches their attachments in the morning, as breaking is to clay pots tapped by a mallet, as vanishing is to dewdrops touched by the sun’s rays. Hence it is said: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> “The nights and days go slipping by<br /> As life keeps dwindling steadily<br /> Till mortals’ span, like water pools<br /> In failing rills, is all used up” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>I 109</b>). </blockquote>
<blockquote class="verse"> “As there is fear, when fruits are ripe,<br /> That in the morning they will fall,<br /> So mortals are in constant fear,<br /> When they are born, that they will die.<br /> And as the fate of pots of clay<br /> Once fashioned by the potter’s hand,<br /> Or small or big or baked or raw,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000647">
  <sup class="footnotemark">4</sup>
</a><br /> Condemns them to be broken up,<br /> So mortals’ life leads but to death” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Sn" >Sn</a>
	]
</span>p. 576f.</b>). </blockquote>
<blockquote class="verse"> “The dewdrop on the blade of grass<br /> Vanishes when the sun comes up;<br /> Such is a human span of life;<br /> So, mother, do not hinder me” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#J-a" >J-a</a>
	]
</span>IV 122</b>). </blockquote>
<p><a name="VIII.13" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.13" ><b class="bfseries">§13.</b></a></a>  So this death, which comes along with birth, is like a murderer with poised sword. And like the murderer who applies the sword to the neck, it carries off life and never returns to bring it back. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[232]</i></span> That is why, since death appears like a murderer with poised sword owing to its coming along with birth and carrying off life, it should be recollected as “having the appearance of a murderer.” </p>
<h3 id="a0000000185">Ruin of success</h3>
<p><a name="VIII.14" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.14" ><b class="bfseries">§14.</b></a></a>  <em>2. As the ruin of success</em>: here success shines as long as failure does not overcome it. And the success does not exist that might endure out of reach of failure. Accordingly: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> “He gave with joy a hundred millions<br /> After conquering all the earth,<br /> Till in the end his realm came down </blockquote>
<blockquote class="verse"> <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{286|228}</small></span>To less than half a gall-nut’s worth.<br /> Yet when his merit was used up,<br /> His body breathing its last breath,<br /> The Sorrowless Asoka too<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000648">
  <sup class="footnotemark">5</sup>
</a><br /> Felt sorrow face to face with death.” </blockquote>
<p><a name="VIII.15" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.15" ><b class="bfseries">§15.</b></a></a>  Furthermore, all health ends in sickness, all youth ends in aging, all life ends in death; all worldly existence is procured by birth, haunted by aging, surprised by sickness, and struck down by death. Hence it is said: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> “As though huge mountains made of rock<br /> So vast they reached up to the sky<br /> Were to advance from every side,<br /> Grinding beneath them all that lives,<br /> So age and death roll over all,<br /> Warriors, priests, merchants, and craftsmen,<br /> The outcastes and the scavengers,<br /> Crushing all beings, sparing none.<br /> And here no troops of elephants,<br /> No charioteers, no infantry,<br /> No strategy in form of spells,<br /> No riches, serve to beat them off” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>I 102</b>). </blockquote>
<p>This is how death should be recollected as the “ruin of success” by defining it as death’s final ruining of life’s success. </p>
<h3 id="a0000000186">By comparison</h3>
<p><a name="VIII.16" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  <em>3. By comparison</em>: by comparing oneself to others. Herein, death should be recollected by comparison in seven ways, that is to say: with those of great fame, with those of great merit, with those of great strength, with those of great supernormal power, with those of great understanding, with Paccekabuddhas, with fully enlightened Buddhas. How? </p>
<p><a name="VIII.17" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.17" ><b class="bfseries">§17.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[233]</i></span> Although Mahāsammata, Mandhātu, Mahāsudassana, Daḷhanemi, Nimi,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000649">

<p><a name="VIII.20" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.20" ><b class="bfseries">§20.</b></a></a>  How by comparison with those of great supernormal power? </p>

<p>It should be recollected in this way by comparison with Paccekabuddhas. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.23" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.23" ><b class="bfseries">§23.</b></a></a>  How by comparison <em>with fully enlightened Buddhas</em>? Even the Blessed One, whose material body was embellished with the eighty lesser details and adorned with the thirty-two marks of a great man (see MN 91; DN 30), whose Dhamma body brought to perfection the treasured qualities of the aggregates of virtue, etc.,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000651">

</a> made pure in every aspect, who overpassed greatness of fame, greatness of merit, greatness of strength, greatness of supernormal power and greatness of understanding, who had no equal, who was the equal of those without equal, without double, accomplished and fully enlightened—even he was suddenly quenched by the downpour of death’s rain, as a great mass of fire is quenched by the downpour of a rain of water. </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> And so the Greatest Sage possessed<br /> Such mighty power in every way,<br /> And it was not through fear or guilt<br /> That over him Death held his sway. </blockquote>
<blockquote class="verse"> No being, not even one without<br /> Guilt or pusillanimity,<br /> But will be smitten down; so how I<br /> Will he not conquer those like me? </blockquote>
<p>It should be recollected in this way by comparison with fully enlightened Buddhas. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.24" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.24" ><b class="bfseries">§24.</b></a></a>  When he does his recollecting in this way by comparing himself with others possessed of such great fame, etc., in the light of the universality of death, thinking, “Death will come to me even as it did to those distinguished beings,” then his meditation subject reaches access. This is how death should be recollected by comparison. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[235]</i></span> </p>
<h3 id="a0000000187">Sharing of the body with many</h3>
<p><a name="VIII.25" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.25" ><b class="bfseries">§25.</b></a></a>  <em>4. As to the sharing of the body with many</em>: this body is shared by many. Firstly, it is shared by the eighty families of worms. There too, creatures live in dependence <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{289|231}</small></span>on the outer skin, feeding on the outer skin; creatures live in dependence on the inner skin, feeding on the inner skin; creatures live in dependence on the flesh, feeding on the flesh; creatures live in dependence on the sinews, feeding on the sinews; creatures live in dependence on the bones, feeding on the bones; and creatures live in dependence on the marrow, feeding on the marrow. And there they are born, grow old and die, evacuate, and make water; and the body is their maternity home, their hospital, their charnel-ground, their privy and their urinal. The body can also be brought to death with the upsetting of these worms. And just as it is shared with the eighty families of worms, so too it is shared by the several hundred internal diseases, as well as by such external causes of death as snakes, scorpions, and what not. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.26" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.26" ><b class="bfseries">§26.</b></a></a>  And just as when a target is set up at a crossroads and then arrows, spears, pikes, stones, etc., come from all directions and fall upon it, so too all kinds of accidents befall the body, and it also comes to death through these accidents befalling it. Hence the Blessed One said: “Here, bhikkhus, when day is departing and night is drawing on,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000652">
  <sup class="footnotemark">9</sup>
</a> a bhikkhu considers thus: ‘In many ways I can risk death. A snake may bite me, or a scorpion may sting me, or a centipede may sting me. I might die of that, and that would set me back. Or I might stumble and fall, or the food I have eaten might disagree with me, or my bile might get upset, or my phlegm might get upset [and sever my joints as it were] like knives. I might die of that, and that would set me back’” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#A" >A</a>

</span>III 306</b>). </p>
<p>That is how death should be recollected as to sharing the body with many. </p>
<h3 id="a0000000188">Fraility of life</h3>
<p><a name="VIII.27" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.27" ><b class="bfseries">§27.</b></a></a>  <em>5. As to the frailty of life</em>: this life is impotent and frail. For the life of beings is bound up with breathing, it is bound up with the postures, it is bound up with cold and heat, it is bound up with the primary elements, and it is bound up with nutriment. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.28" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.28" ><b class="bfseries">§28.</b></a></a>  Life occurs only when the in-breaths and out-breaths occur evenly. But when the wind in the nostrils that has gone outside does not go in again, or when that which has gone inside does not come out again, then a man is reckoned to be dead. </p>
<p>And it occurs only when the four postures are found occurring evenly. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[236]</i></span> </p>
<p>But with the prevailing of anyone of them the life process is interrupted. </p>
<p>And it occurs only when cold and heat are found occurring evenly. But it fails when a man is overcome by excessive cold or heat. </p>
<p>And it occurs only when the four primary elements are found occurring evenly. But with the disturbance of the earth element even a strong man’s life can be terminated if his body becomes rigid, or with the disturbance of one of the elements beginning with water if his body becomes flaccid and petrified with a flux of the bowels, etc., or if he is consumed by a bad fever, or if he suffers a severing of his limb-joint ligatures (cf. <a href="ch-17.html#XI.102" >XI.102</a>). </p>
<p><span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{290|232}</small></span>And life occurs only in one who gets physical nutriment at the proper time; but if he gets none, he uses his life up. </p>
<p>This is how death should be recollected as to the frailty of life. </p>
<h3 id="a0000000189">Signless</h3>
<p><a name="VIII.29" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.29" ><b class="bfseries">§29.</b></a></a>  <em>6. As signless</em>: as indefinable. The meaning is that it is unpredictable. For in the case of all beings: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> The span, the sickness, and the time, and where<br /> The body will be laid, the destiny:<br /> The living world can never know<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000653">

<p><a name="VIII.30" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.30" ><b class="bfseries">§30.</b></a></a>  Herein, firstly <em>the span </em>has no sign because there is no definition such as: Just so much must be lived, no more than that.

But since the object is stated with individual essences,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000655">
  <sup class="footnotemark">12</sup>
</a> and since it awakens a sense of urgency, the jhāna does not reach absorption and is only access. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[239]</i></span> Now, with special development, the supramundane jhāna and the second and the fourth immaterial jhānas reach absorption even with respect to states with individual essences. For the supramundane reaches absorption by means of <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{294|236}</small></span>progressive development of the purification and the immaterial jhānas do so by means of development consisting in the surmounting of the object (see <a href="ch-16.html#X" >Ch. X</a>) since there [in those two immaterial jhānas] there is merely the surmounting of the object of jhāna that had already reached absorption. But here [in mundane mindfulness of death] there is neither so the jhāna only reaches access. And that access is known as “mindfulness of death” too since it arises through its means. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.41" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.41" ><b class="bfseries">§41.</b></a></a>  A bhikkhu devoted to mindfulness of death is constantly diligent. He acquires perception of disenchantment with all kinds of becoming (existence). He conquers attachment to life. He condemns evil. He avoids much storing. He has no stain of avarice about requisites. Perception of impermanence grows in him, following upon which there appear the perceptions of pain and not-self. But while beings who have not developed [mindfulness of] death fall victims to fear, horror and confusion at the time of death as though suddenly seized by wild beasts, spirits, snakes, robbers, or murderers, he dies undeluded and fearless without falling into any such state. And if he does not attain the deathless here and now, he is at least headed for a happy destiny on the breakup of the body. </p>

<h3 id="a0000000197">The Sevenfold Skill in Learning</h3>
<p>Herein, the sevenfold skill in learning should be told thus: (1) as verbal recitation, (2) as mental recitation, (3) as to colour, (4) as to shape, (5) as to direction, (6) as to location, (7) as to delimitation. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.49" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.49" ><b class="bfseries">§49.</b></a></a>  <em>1.</em> This meditation subject consists in giving attention to repulsiveness. Even if one is master of the Tipiṭaka, the <em>verbal recitation </em>should still be done at the time of first giving it attention. For the meditation subject only becomes evident to some through recitation, as it did to the two elders who learned the meditation subject from the Elder Mahā Deva of the Hill Country (Malaya). On being asked for the meditation subject, it seems, the elder <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[242]</i></span> gave the text of the thirty-two aspects, saying, “Do only this recitation for four months.” Although they were familiar respectively with two and three Piṭakas, it was only at the end of four months of recitation of the meditation subject that they became stream-enterers, with right apprehension [of the text]. So the teacher who expounds the meditation subject should tell the pupil to do the recitation verbally first. </p>

Herein, it is an insight meditation subject that is expounded as elements and a serenity meditation subject that is expounded as repulsiveness.

<p><a name="VIII.65" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.65" ><b class="bfseries">§65.</b></a></a>  <em>4. As to warding off distraction</em>: he must ward off [temptation] to drop the meditation subject and to let his mind get distracted among the variety of external objects. For if not, just as when a man has entered on a one-foot-wide cliff path, if he looks about here and there without watching his step, he may miss his footing and fall down the cliff, which is perhaps as high as a hundred men, so too, when there is outward distraction, the meditation subject gets neglected and deteriorates.

<p><a name="VIII.66" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.66" ><b class="bfseries">§66.</b></a></a>  <em>5. As to surmounting the concept</em>: this [name-] concept beginning with “head hairs, body hairs” must be surmounted and consciousness established on [the aspect] “repulsive.” For just as when men find a water hole in a forest in a time <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{299|241}</small></span>of drought, they hang up some kind of signal there such as a palm leaf, and people come to bathe and drink guided by the signal, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[245]</i></span> but when the way has become plain with their continual traffic, there is no further need of the signal and they go to bathe and drink there whenever they want, so too, when repulsiveness becomes evident to him as he is giving his attention to the meditation subject through the means of the [name-] concept “head hairs, body hairs,” he must surmount the concept “head hairs, body hairs” and establish consciousness on only the actual repulsiveness. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.67" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.67" ><b class="bfseries">§67.</b></a></a>  <em>6. As to successive leaving</em>: in giving his attention he should eventually leave out any [parts] that do not appear to him. For when a beginner gives his attention to head hairs, his attention then carries on till it arrives at the last part, that is, urine and stops there; and when he gives his attention to urine, his attention then carries on till it arrives back at the first part, that is, head hairs, and stops there. As he persists in giving his attention thus, some parts appear to him and others do not. Then he should work on those that have appeared till one out of any two appears the clearer. He should arouse absorption by again and again giving attention to the one that has appeared thus. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.68" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.68" ><b class="bfseries">§68.</b></a></a>  Here is a simile. Suppose a hunter wanted to catch a monkey that lived in a grove of thirty-two palms, and he shot an arrow through a leaf of the palm that stood at the beginning and gave a shout; then the monkey went leaping successively from palm to palm till it reached the last palm; and when the hunter went there too and did as before, it came back in like manner to the first palm; and being followed thus again and again, after leaping from each place where a shout was given, it eventually jumped on to one palm, and firmly seizing the palm shoot’s leaf spike in the middle, would not leap any more even when shot—so it is with this. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.69" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.69" ><b class="bfseries">§69.</b></a></a>  The application of the simile is this. The thirty-two parts of the body are like the thirty-two palms in the grove. The monkey is like the mind. The meditator is like the hunter. The range of the meditator’s mind in the body with its thirty-two parts as object is like the monkey’s inhabiting the palm grove of thirty-two palms. The settling down of the meditator’s mind in the last part after going successively [from part to part] when he began by giving his attention to head hairs is like the monkey’s leaping from palm to palm and going to the last palm, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[246]</i></span> when the hunter shot an arrow through the leaf of the palm where it was and gave a shout. Likewise in the return to the beginning. His doing the preliminary work on those parts that have appeared, leaving behind those that did not appear while, as he gave his attention to them again and again, some appeared to him and some did not, is like the monkey’s being followed and leaping up from each place where a shout is given. The meditator’s repeated attention given to the part that in the end appears the more clearly of any two that have appeared to him and his finally reaching absorption, is like the monkey’s eventually stopping in one palm, firmly seizing the palm shoot’s leaf spike in the middle and not leaping up even when shot. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.70" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.70" ><b class="bfseries">§70.</b></a></a>  There is another simile too. Suppose an alms-food-eater bhikkhu went to live near a village of thirty-two families, and when he got two lots of alms at the first house he left out one [house] beyond it, and next day, when he got three lots <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{300|242}</small></span>of [alms at the first house] he left out two [houses] beyond it, and on the third day he got his bowl full at the first [house], and went to the sitting hall and ate—so it is with this. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.71" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.71" ><b class="bfseries">§71.</b></a></a>  The thirty-two aspects are like the village with the thirty-two families. The meditator is like the alms-food eater. The meditator’s preliminary work is like the alms-food eater’s going to live near the village. The meditator’s continuing to give attention after leaving out those parts that do not appear and doing his preliminary work on the pair of parts that do appear is like the alms-food eater’s getting two lots of alms at the first house and leaving out one [house] beyond it, and like his next day getting three [lots of alms at the first house] and leaving out two [houses] beyond it. The arousing of absorption by giving attention again and again to that which has appeared the more clearly of two is like the alms-food eater’s getting his bowl full at the first [house] on the third day and then going to the sitting hall and eating. </p>

<p><a name="VIII.83" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.83" ><b class="bfseries">§83.</b></a></a>  Here is the explanation of all the parts given in successive order. </p>
<p>[<span class="scshape"><b class="bfseries">Head Hairs</b></span>] </p>
<p>(a) Firstly head hairs are black in their normal <em>colour</em>, the colour of fresh <em>ariṭṭhaka </em>seeds.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000662">
  <sup class="footnotemark">19</sup>
</a> As to <em>shape</em>, they are the shape of long round measuring rods.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000663">
  <sup class="footnotemark">20</sup>
</a> As to <em>direction</em>, they lie in the upper direction. As to <em>location</em>, their location is the wet inner skin that envelops the skull; it is bounded on both sides by the roots of the ears, in front by the forehead, and behind by the nape of the neck.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000664">
  <sup class="footnotemark">21</sup>
</a> As to <em>delimitation</em>, they are bounded below by the surface of their own roots, which are fixed by entering to the amount of the tip of a rice grain into the inner skin that envelops the head. They are bounded above by space, and all round by each other. There are no two hairs together. This is their delimitation by the similar. Head hairs are not body hairs, and body hairs are not head hairs; being likewise not intermixed with the remaining thirty-one parts, the head hairs are a separate part. This is their delimitation by the dissimilar. Such is the definition of head hairs as to colour and so on. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.84" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.84" ><b class="bfseries">§84.</b></a></a>  (b) Their definition <em>as to repulsiveness </em>in the five ways, that is, by colour, etc., is as follows. Head hairs are repulsive in colour as well as in shape, odour, habitat, and location. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.85" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.85" ><b class="bfseries">§85.</b></a></a>  For on seeing the colour of a head hair in a bowl of inviting rice gruel or cooked rice, people are disgusted and say, “This has got hairs in it. Take it away.” So they are repulsive in <em>colour</em>. Also when people are eating at night, they are likewise disgusted by the mere sensation of a hair-shaped <em>akka</em>-bark or <em>makaci</em>-bark fibre. So they are repulsive in <em>shape</em>. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.86" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.86" ><b class="bfseries">§86.</b></a></a>  And the <em>odour </em>of head hairs, unless dressed with a smearing of oil, scented with flowers, etc., is most offensive. And it is still worse when they are put in the <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{303|245}</small></span>fire. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[250]</i></span> Even if head hairs are not directly repulsive in colour and shape, still their odour is directly repulsive. Just as a baby’s excrement, as to its colour, is the colour of turmeric and, as to its shape, is the shape of a piece of turmeric root, and just as the bloated carcass of a black dog thrown on a rubbish heap, as to its colour, is the colour of a ripe palmyra fruit and, as to its shape, is the shape of a [mandolin-shaped] drum left face down, and its fangs are like jasmine buds, and so even if both these are not directly repulsive in colour and shape, still their odour is directly repulsive, so too, even if head hairs are not directly repulsive in colour and shape, still their odour is directly repulsive. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.87" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.87" ><b class="bfseries">§87.</b></a></a>  But just as pot herbs that grow on village sewage in a filthy place are disgusting to civilized people and unusable, so also head hairs are disgusting since they grow on the sewage of pus, blood, urine, dung, bile, phlegm, and the like. This is the repulsive aspect of the <em>habitat</em>. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.88" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.88" ><b class="bfseries">§88.</b></a></a>  And these head hairs grow on the heap of the [other] thirty-one parts as fungi do on a dung-hill. And owing to the filthy place they grow in they are quite as unappetizing as vegetables growing on a charnel-ground, on a midden, etc., as lotuses or water lilies growing in drains, and so on. This is the repulsive aspect of their <em>location</em>. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.89" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.89" ><b class="bfseries">§89.</b></a></a>  And as in the case of head hairs, so also the repulsiveness of all the parts should be defined (b) in the same five ways by colour, shape, odour, habitat, and location. All, however, must be defined individually (a) by colour, shape, direction, location, and delimitation, as follows. </p>
<p>[<span class="scshape"><b class="bfseries">Body Hairs</b></span>] </p>
<p><a name="VIII.90" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.90" ><b class="bfseries">§90.</b></a></a>  Herein, firstly, as to natural <em>colour</em>, body, hairs are not pure black like head hairs but blackish brown. As to <em>shape</em>, they are the shape of palm roots with the tips bent down. As to <em>direction</em>, they lie in the two directions. As to <em>location</em>, except for the locations where the head hairs are established, and for the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, they grow in most of the rest of the inner skin that envelops the body. As to <em>delimitation</em>, they are bounded below by the surface of their own roots, which are fixed by entering to the extent of a <em>likhā</em><a class="footnote" href="#a0000000665">
  <sup class="footnotemark">22</sup>
</a><em> into the inner skin that envelops the body, above by space, and all round by each other. T</em>here are no two body hairs together. This is the delimitation by the similar. But their delimitation by the dissimilar is like that for the head hairs. [Note: These two last sentences are repeated verbatim at the end of the description of each part. They are not translated in the remaining thirty parts]. </p>

As to <em>location</em>, they are fixed on the tips of the backs of the fingers and toes.

As to <em>shape</em>, they are of various shapes; for firstly in the lower row, the four middle teeth are the shape of pumpkin seeds set in a row in a lump of clay; that on each side of them has one root and one point and is the shape of a jasmine bud; each one after that has two roots and two points and is the shape of a wagon prop; then two each side with three roots and three points, then two each side four-rooted and four-pointed. Likewise in the upper row. As to <em>direction</em>, they lie in the upper direction. As to <em>location</em>, they are fixed in the jawbones. As to <em>delimitation</em>, they are bounded by the surface of their own roots which are fixed in the jawbones; they are bounded above by space, and all round by each other. There are no two teeth together … </p>

But as to <em>colour</em>, the skin itself is white; and its whiteness becomes evident when the outer cuticle is destroyed by contact with the flame of a fire or the impact of a blow and so on. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.94" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.94" ><b class="bfseries">§94.</b></a></a>  As to <em>shape</em>, it is the shape of the body in brief.

Next, the inner skin of the shoulders. Next, the inner skin of the right arm forwards and backwards; and then in the same way the inner skin of the left <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{305|247}</small></span>arm. Next, after defining the inner skin of the back, he should define the inner skin of the right leg forwards and backwards; then the inner skin of the left leg in the same way. Next, the inner skin of the groin, the paunch, the bosom and the neck should be successively defined. Then, after defining the inner skin of the lower jaw next after that of the neck, he should finish on arriving at the lower lip. When he discerns it in the gross in this way, it becomes evident to him more subtly too. </p>

<h3 id="a0000000201">The Arising of Absorption</h3>
<p><a name="VIII.139" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.139" ><b class="bfseries">§139.</b></a></a>  When the meditator has defined the parts beginning with the head hairs in this way by colour, shape, direction, location and delimitation (<a href="ch-14.html#VIII.58" >§58</a>), and he gives his attention in the ways beginning with “following the order, not too quickly” (<a href="ch-14.html#VIII.61" >§61</a>) to their repulsiveness in the five aspects of colour, shape, smell, habitat, and location (<a href="ch-14.html#VIII.84" >§84f.</a>), then at last he surmounts the concept (<a href="ch-14.html#VIII.66" >§66</a>). Then just as when a man with good sight is observing a garland of flowers of thirty-two colours knotted on a single string and all the flowers become evident to him simultaneously, so too, when the meditator observes this body thus, “There are in this body head hairs,” then all these things become evident to him, as it were, simultaneously. Hence it was said above in the explanation of skill in giving attention: “For when a beginner gives his attention to head hairs, his attention carries on till it arrives at the last part, that is, urine, and stops there” (<a href="ch-14.html#VIII.67" >§67</a>). </p>
<p><a name="VIII.140" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.140" ><b class="bfseries">§140.</b></a></a>  If he applies his attention externally as well when all the parts have become evident in this way, then human beings, animals, etc., as they go about are divested of their aspect of beings and appear as just assemblages of parts. And <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{316|258}</small></span>when drink, food, etc., is being swallowed by them, it appears as though it were being put in among the assemblage of parts. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.141" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.141" ><b class="bfseries">§141.</b></a></a>  Then, as he gives his attention to them again and again as “Repulsive, repulsive,” employing the process of “successive leaving,” etc. (<a href="ch-14.html#VIII.67" >§67</a>), eventually absorption arises in him. Herein, the appearance of the head hairs, etc., as to colour, shape, direction, location, and delimitation is the learning sign; their appearance as repulsive in all aspects is the counterpart sign. </p>
<p>As he cultivates and develops that counterpart sign, absorption arises in him, but only of the first jhāna, in the same way as described under foulness as a meditation subject (<a href="ch-12.html#VI.64" >VI.64f.</a>). And it arises singly in one to whom only one part has become evident, or who has reached absorption in one part and makes no further effort about another. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.142" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.142" ><b class="bfseries">§142.</b></a></a>  But several first jhānas, according to the number of parts, are produced in one to whom several parts have become evident, or who has reached jhāna in one and also makes further effort about another.

<h2 id="a0000000204">3.2 Word Commentary</h2>
<p><em>And how developed, bhikkhus, how practiced much, is concentration through mindfulness of breathing</em>: here in the first place <em>how</em> is a question showing desire to explain in detail the development of concentration through mindfulness of breathing in its various forms. <em>Developed, bhikkhus, … is concentration through mindfulness of breathing</em>: this shows the thing that is being asked about out of desire to explain it in its various forms. <em>How practiced much … as soon as they arise</em>?: here too the same explanation applies. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.147" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.147" ><b class="bfseries">§147.</b></a></a>  Herein, <em>developed </em>means aroused or increased, <em>concentration through mindfulness of breathing </em>(lit. “breathing-mindfulness concentration”) is either concentration associated with mindfulness that discerns breathing, or it is concentration on mindfulness of breathing. <em>Practiced much</em>: practiced again and again. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.148" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.148" ><b class="bfseries">§148.</b></a></a>  <em>Both peaceful and sublime </em>(<em>santo c’ eva paṇīto ca</em>): it is peaceful in both ways and sublime in both ways; the two words should each be understood as governed by the word “both” (<em>eva</em>). What is meant? Unlike foulness, which as a meditation subject is peaceful and sublime only by penetration, but is neither (<em>n’ eva</em>) peaceful nor sublime in its object since its object [in the learning stage] is gross, and [after that] its object is repulsiveness—unlike that, this is not unpeaceful or unsublime in any way, but on the contrary it is peaceful, stilled and quiet both on account of the peacefulness of its object and on account of the peacefulness of that one of its factors called penetration. And it is sublime, something one cannot have enough of, both on account of the sublimeness of its object and on <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[268]</i></span> account of the sublimeness of the aforesaid factor. Hence it is called “both peaceful and sublime.” </p>
<p><a name="VIII.149" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.149" ><b class="bfseries">§149.</b></a></a>  <em>It is an unadulterated blissful abiding</em>: it has no adulteration, thus it is unadulterated; it is unalloyed, unmixed, particular, special. Here it is not a question of peacefulness to be reached through preliminary work [as with the kasiṇas] or through access [as with foulness, for instance]. It is peaceful and sublime in its own individual essence too starting with the very first attention given to it. But some<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000681">
  <sup class="footnotemark">38</sup>
</a> say that it is “unadulterated” because it is unalloyed, <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{319|261}</small></span>possessed of nutritive value and sweet in its individual essence too. So it should be understood to be “unadulterated” and a “blissful abiding” since it leads to the obtaining of bodily and mental bliss with every moment of absorption. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.150" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.150" ><b class="bfseries">§150.</b></a></a>  <em>As soon as they arise</em>: whenever they are not suppressed. <em>Evil</em>: bad. <em>Unprofitable </em>(<em>akusala</em>) <em>thoughts</em>: thoughts produced by unskilfulness (<em>akosalla</em>). <em>It banishes at once</em>: it banishes, suppresses, at that very moment. <em>Stills </em>(<em>vūpasameti</em>): it thoroughly calms (<em>suṭṭhu upasameti</em>); or else, when eventually brought to fulfilment by the noble path, it cuts off, because of partaking of penetration; it tranquilizes, is what is meant. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.151" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.151" ><b class="bfseries">§151.</b></a></a>  In brief, however, the meaning here is this: “Bhikkhus, in what way, in what manner, by what system, is concentration through mindfulness of breathing developed, in what way is it practiced much, that it is both peaceful … as soon as they arise?” </p>
<p><a name="VIII.152" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.152" ><b class="bfseries">§152.</b></a></a>  He now said, “Here, bhikkhus,” etc., giving the meaning of that in detail. </p>
<p>Herein, <em>here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu </em>means: bhikkhus, in this dispensation a bhikkhu. For this word <em>here </em>signifies the [Buddha’s] dispensation as the prerequisite for a person to produce concentration through mindfulness of breathing in all its modes,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000682">
  <sup class="footnotemark">39</sup>
</a> and it denies that such a state exists in any other dispensation. For this is said: “Bhikkhus, only here is there an ascetic, here a second ascetic, here a third ascetic, here a fourth ascetic; other dispensations are devoid of ascetics” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

  <sup class="footnotemark">40</sup>
</a> That is why it was said above “in this dispensation a bhikkhu.” </p>
<p><a name="VIII.153" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.153" ><b class="bfseries">§153.</b></a></a>  <em>Gone to the forest … or to an empty place</em>: this signifies that he has found an abode favourable to the development of concentration through mindfulness of breathing. For this bhikkhu’s mind has long been dissipated among visible data, etc., as its object, and it does not want to mount the object of concentration-through-mindfulness-of-breathing; it runs off the track like a chariot harnessed to a wild ox.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000684">
  <sup class="footnotemark">41</sup>
</a> Now, suppose a cowherd <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[269]</i></span> wanted to tame a wild calf that had been reared on a wild cow’s milk, he would take it away from the cow and tie it up apart with a rope to a stout post dug into the ground; then the calf might dash to and fro, but being unable to get away, it would eventually sit down or lie down by the post. So too, when a bhikkhu wants to tame his own mind which has long been spoilt by being reared on visible data, etc., as object for its food and drink, he should take it away from visible data, etc., as object and bring it into the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty place and tie it up there to the post of in-breaths and out-breaths with the rope of mindfulness. And so his mind may then dash to and fro when it no longer gets the objects it was formerly <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{320|262}</small></span>used to, but being unable to break the rope of mindfulness and get away, it sits down, lies down, by that object under the influence of access and absorption. Hence the Ancients said: </p>
<p><a name="VIII.154" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.154" ><b class="bfseries">§154.</b></a></a>  </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> “Just as a man who tames a calf<br /> Would tie it to a post, so here<br /> Should his own mind by mindfulness<br /> Be firmly to the object tied.” </blockquote>
<p>This is how an abode is favourable to his development. Hence it was said above: “This signifies that he has found an abode favourable to the development of concentration through mindfulness of breathing.” </p>
<p><a name="VIII.155" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.155" ><b class="bfseries">§155.</b></a></a>  Or alternatively, this mindfulness of breathing as a meditation subject—which is foremost among the various meditation subjects of all Buddhas, [some] Paccekabuddhas and [some] Buddhas’ disciples as a basis for attaining distinction and abiding in bliss here and now—is not easy to develop without leaving the neighbourhood of villages, which resound with the noises of women, men, elephants, horses, etc., noise being a thorn to jhāna (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	<a href="ch-03.html#A" >A</a>

This is the opinion of the Dīgha and Saṃyutta reciters.

It is, however, the opinion of all that the bodily formation occurring before the time of discerning becomes tranquilized at the time of discerning, and the bodily formation at the time of discerning becomes tranquilized in the first-jhāna access … and the bodily formation occurring in the fourth-jhāna access becomes tranquilized in the fourth jhāna.

<p>This, in the first place, is the consecutive word commentary here on the first tetrad, which deals with contemplation of the body. </p>
<h3 id="a0000000206">Method of Development</h3>
<p><a name="VIII.186" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.186" ><b class="bfseries">§186.</b></a></a>  The first tetrad is set forth as a meditation subject for a beginner;<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000695">
  <sup class="footnotemark">52</sup>
</a> but the other three tetrads are [respectively] set forth as the contemplations of feeling, of [the manner of] consciousness, and of mental objects, for one who has already attained jhāna in this tetrad. So if a clansman who is a beginner wants to develop this meditation subject, and through insight based on the fourth jhāna produced in breathing, to reach Arahantship together with the discriminations, he should first do all the work connected with the purification of virtue, etc., in the way already described, after which he should learn the meditation subject in five stages from a teacher of the kind already described. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.187" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.187" ><b class="bfseries">§187.</b></a></a>  Here are the five stages: learning, questioning, establishing, absorption, characteristic. </p>
<p>Herein, <em>learning </em>is learning the meditation subject. <em>Questioning </em>is questioning about the meditation subject. <em>Establishing </em>is establishing the meditation subject. <em>Absorption </em><span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[278]</i></span> is the absorption of the meditation subject. <em>Characteristic </em>is the characteristic of the meditation subject; what is meant is that it is the ascertaining of the meditation subject’s individual essence thus: “This meditation subject has such a characteristic.” </p>
<p><a name="VIII.188" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.188" ><b class="bfseries">§188.</b></a></a>  Learning the meditation subject in the five stages in this way, he neither tires himself nor worries the teacher. So in giving this meditation subject consisting in mindfulness of breathing attention, he can live either with the teacher or elsewhere in an abode of the kind already described, learning the meditation subject in the five stages thus, getting a little expounded at a time and taking a long time over reciting it. He should sever the minor impediments. After finishing the work connected with the meal and getting rid of any dizziness due to the meal, he should seat himself comfortably. Then, making sure he is not confused about even a single word of what he has learned from the teacher, he should cheer his mind by recollecting the special qualities of the Three Jewels. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.189" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.189" ><b class="bfseries">§189.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{330|272}</small></span>Here are the stages in giving attention to it: (1) counting, (2) connection, (3) touching, (4) fixing, (5) observing, (6) turning away, (7) purification, and (8) looking back on these. </p>
<p>Herein, <em>counting </em>is just counting, <em>connection </em>is carrying on, <em>touching </em>is the place touched [by the breaths], <em>fixing </em>is absorption, <em>observing </em>is insight, <em>turning away </em>is the path, <em>purification </em>is fruition, <em>looking back on these </em>is reviewing. </p>
<p>[<span class="scshape"><b class="bfseries">Counting</b></span>] </p>
<p><a name="VIII.190" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.190" ><b class="bfseries">§190.</b></a></a>  <em>1.</em> Herein, this clansman who is a beginner should first give attention to this meditation subject by counting. And when counting, he should not stop short of five or go beyond ten or make any break in the series. By stopping short of five his thoughts get excited in the cramped space, like a herd of cattle shut in a cramped pen. By going beyond ten his thoughts take the number [rather than the breaths] for their support. By making a break in the series he wonders if the meditation subject has reached completion or not. So he should do his counting without those faults. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.191" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.191" ><b class="bfseries">§191.</b></a></a>  When counting, he should at first do it slowly [that is, late] as a grain measurer does. For a grain measurer, having filled his measure, says “One,” and empties it, and then refilling it, he goes on saying ‘”One, one” while removing any rubbish he may have noticed. And the same with “Two, two” and so on. So, taking the in-breath or the out-breath, whichever appears [most plainly], he should begin with “One, one” <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[279]</i></span> and count up to “Ten, ten,” noting each as it occurs. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.192" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.192" ><b class="bfseries">§192.</b></a></a>  As he does his counting in this way, the in-breaths and out-breaths become evident to him as they enter in and issue out. Then he can leave off counting slowly (late), like a grain measurer, and he can count quickly [that is, early] as a cowherd does. For a skilled cowherd takes pebbles in his pocket and goes to the cow pen in the morning, whip in hand; sitting on the bar of the gate, prodding the cows in the back, he counts each one as it reaches the gate, saying “One, two,” dropping a pebble for each. And the cows of the herd, which have been spending the three watches of the night uncomfortably in the cramped space, come out quickly in parties, jostling each other as they escape. So he counts quickly (early) “Three, four, five” and so up to ten. In this way the in-breaths and out-breaths, which had already become evident to him while he counted them in the former way, now keep moving along quickly. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.193" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.193" ><b class="bfseries">§193.</b></a></a>  Then, knowing that they keep moving along quickly, not apprehending them either inside or outside [the body], but apprehending them just as they reach the [nostril] door, he can do his counting quickly (early): “One, two, three, four, five; one, two, three, four, five, six … seven … eight … nine … ten.” For as long as the meditation subject is connected with counting it is with the help of that very counting that the mind becomes unified, just as a boat in a swift current is steadied with the help of a rudder. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.194" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.194" ><b class="bfseries">§194.</b></a></a>  When he counts quickly, the meditation subject becomes apparent to him as an uninterrupted process. Then, knowing that it is proceeding uninterruptedly, he can count quickly (early) in the way just described, not discerning the wind either inside or outside [the body]. For by bringing his consciousness inside along with the incoming breath, it seems as if it were buffeted by the wind inside <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{331|273}</small></span>or filled with fat.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000696">
  <sup class="footnotemark">53</sup>
</a> By taking his consciousness outside along with the outgoing breath, it gets distracted by the multiplicity of objects outside. However, his development is successful when he fixes his mindfulness on the place touched [by the breaths]. That is why it was said above: “He can count quickly (early) in the way just described, not discerning the wind either inside or outside.” </p>
<p><a name="VIII.195" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.195" ><b class="bfseries">§195.</b></a></a>  But how long is he to go on counting? Until, without counting, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[280]</i></span> mindfulness remains settled on the in-breaths and out-breaths as its object. For counting is simply a device for setting mindfulness on the in-breaths and out-breaths as object by cutting off the external dissipation of applied thoughts. </p>
<p>[<span class="scshape"><b class="bfseries">Connection</b></span>] </p>
<p><a name="VIII.196" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.196" ><b class="bfseries">§196.</b></a></a>  <em>2.</em> Having given attention to it in this way by counting, he should now do so by <em>connection. Connection </em>is the uninterrupted following of the in-breaths and out-breaths with mindfulness after counting has been given up. And that is not by following after the beginning, the middle and the end.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000697">
  <sup class="footnotemark">54</sup>
</a> </p>
<p><a name="VIII.197" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.197" ><b class="bfseries">§197.</b></a></a>  The navel is the beginning of the wind issuing out, the heart is its middle and the nose-tip is its end. The nose-tip is the beginning of the wind entering in, the heart is its middle and the navel is its end. And if he follows after that, his mind is distracted by disquiet and perturbation according as it is said: “When he goes in with mindfulness after the beginning, middle, and end of the in-breath, his mind being distracted internally, both his body and his mind are disquieted and perturbed and shaky. When he goes out with mindfulness after the beginning, middle and end of the out-breath, his mind being distracted externally, both his body and his mind are disquieted and perturbed and shaky” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p>[<span class="scshape"><b class="bfseries">Touching &amp; fixing</b></span>] </p>
<p><em>3–4.</em> So when he gives his attention to it by connection, he should do so not by the beginning, middle and end, but rather by <em>touching </em>and by <em>fixing</em>. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.198" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.198" ><b class="bfseries">§198.</b></a></a>  There is no attention to be given to it by touching separate from fixing as there is by counting separate from connection. But when he is counting the breaths in the place touched by each, he is giving attention to them by counting <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{332|274}</small></span>and touching. When he has given up counting and is connecting them by means of mindfulness in that same place and fixing consciousness by means of absorption, then he is said to be giving his attention to them by connection, touching and fixing. And the meaning of this may be understood through the similes of the man who cannot walk and the gatekeeper given in the commentaries, and through the simile of the saw given in the Paṭisambhidā. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.199" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.199" ><b class="bfseries">§199.</b></a></a>  Here is the simile of the man who cannot walk: Just as a man unable to walk, who is rocking a swing for the amusement of his children and their mother, sits at the foot of the swing post and sees both ends and the middle of the swing plank successively coming and going, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[281]</i></span> yet does not move from his place in order to see both ends and the middle, so too, when a bhikkhu places himself with mindfulness, as it were, at the foot of the post for anchoring [mindfulness] and rocks the swing of the in-breaths and out-breaths; he sits down with mindfulness on the sign at that same place, and follows with mindfulness the beginning, middle and end of the in-breaths and out-breaths at the place touched by them as they come and go; keeping his mind fixed there, he then sees them without moving from his place in order to see them. This is the simile of the man who cannot walk. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.200" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.200" ><b class="bfseries">§200.</b></a></a>  This is the simile of the gatekeeper: Just as a gatekeeper does not examine people inside and outside the town, asking, “Who are you? Where have you come from? Where are you going? What have you got in your hand?”—for those people are not his concern—but he does examine each man as he arrives at the gate, so too, the incoming breaths that have gone inside and the outgoing breaths that have gone outside are not this bhikkhu’s concern, but they are his concern each time they arrive at the [nostril] gate itself. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.201" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.201" ><b class="bfseries">§201.</b></a></a>  Then the simile of the saw should be understood from its beginning. For this is said: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> “Sign, in-breath, out-breath, are not object<br /> Of a single consciousness;<br /> By one who knows not these three things<br /> Development is not obtained.<br /> “Sign, in-breath, out-breath, are not object<br /> Of a single consciousness;<br /> By one who does know these three things<br /> Development can be obtained.” </blockquote>
<p><a name="VIII.202" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.202" ><b class="bfseries">§202.</b></a></a>  “How is it that these three things are not the object of a single consciousness, that they are nevertheless not unknown, that the mind does not become distracted, that he manifests effort, carries out a task, and achieves an effect? </p>
<p>“Suppose there were a tree trunk placed on a level piece of ground, and a man cut it with a saw. The man’s mindfulness is established by the saw’s teeth where they touch the tree trunk, without his giving attention to the saw’s teeth as they approach and recede, though they are not unknown to him as they do so; and he manifests effort, carries out a task, and achieves an effect. As the tree trunk placed on the level piece of ground, so the sign for the anchoring of mindfulness. <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{333|275}</small></span>As the saw’s teeth, so the in-breaths and out-breaths.

<p><a name="VIII.203" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.203" ><b class="bfseries">§203.</b></a></a>  “‘Effort’: what is the effort? The body and the mind of one who is energetic become wieldy—this is the effort. What is the task? Imperfections come to be abandoned in one who is energetic, and his applied thoughts are stilled—this is the task. What is the effect? Fetters come to be abandoned in one who is energetic, and his inherent tendencies come to be done away with—this is the effect. </p>
<p>“So these three things are not the object of a single consciousness, and they are nevertheless not unknown, and the mind does not become distracted, and he manifests effort, carries out a task, and achieves an effect. </p>

  <sup class="footnotemark">55</sup>
</a> </blockquote>
<p>This is the simile of the saw. But here it is precisely his not giving attention [to the breaths] as [yet to] come and [already] gone<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000699">
  <sup class="footnotemark">56</sup>
</a> that should be understood as the purpose. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.204" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.204" ><b class="bfseries">§204.</b></a></a>  When someone gives his attention to this meditation subject, sometimes it is not long before the sign arises in him, and then the <em>fixing</em>, in other words, absorption adorned with the rest of the jhāna factors, is achieved. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.205" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.205" ><b class="bfseries">§205.</b></a></a>  After someone has given his attention to counting, then just as when a body that is disturbed sits down on a bed or chair, the bed or chair sags down and creaks and the cover gets rumpled, but when a body that is not disturbed sits down, the bed or chair neither sags down nor creaks, the cover does not get rumpled, and it is as though filled with cotton wool—why? because a body that is not disturbed is light—so too, after he has given his attention to counting, when the bodily disturbance has been stilled by the gradual cessation of gross in-breaths and out-breaths, then both the body and the mind become light: the physical body is as though it were ready to leap up into the air. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[283]</i></span> </p>
<p><a name="VIII.206" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.206" ><b class="bfseries">§206.</b></a></a>  When his gross in-breaths and out breaths have ceased, his consciousness occurs with the sign of the subtle in-breaths and out-breaths as its object. And when that has ceased, it goes on occurring with the successively subtler signs as its object. How? </p>
<p><a name="VIII.207" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.207" ><b class="bfseries">§207.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{334|276}</small></span>Suppose a man stuck a bronze bell with a big iron bar and at once a loud sound arose, his consciousness would occur with the gross sound as its object; then, when the gross sound had ceased, it would occur afterwards with the sign of the subtle sound as its object; and when that had ceased, it would go on occurring with the sign of the successively subtler sounds as its object. This is how it should be understood. And this is given in detail in the passage beginning, “Just as when a metal gong is struck” (<a href="ch-14.html#VIII.184" >§184</a>). </p>
<p><a name="VIII.208" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.208" ><b class="bfseries">§208.</b></a></a>  For while other meditation subjects become clearer at each higher stage, this one does not: in fact, as he goes on developing it, it becomes more subtle for him at each higher stage, and it even comes to the point at which it is no longer manifest. </p>
<p>However, when it becomes unmanifest in this way, the bhikkhu should not get up from his seat, shake out his leather mat, and go away. What should be done? He should not get up with the idea “Shall I ask the teacher?” or “Is my meditation subject lost?”; for by going away, and so disturbing his posture, the meditation subject has to be started anew. So he should go on sitting as he was and [temporarily] substitute the place [normally touched for the actual breaths as the object of contemplation].<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000700">

</a> </p>
<p><a name="VIII.209" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.209" ><b class="bfseries">§209.</b></a></a>  These are the means for doing it. The bhikkhu should recognize the unmanifest state of the meditation subject and consider thus: “Where do these in-breaths and out-breaths exist? Where do they not? In whom do they exist? In whom not?” Then, as he considers thus, he finds that they do not exist in one inside the mother’s womb, or in those drowned in water, or likewise in unconscious beings,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000701">
  <sup class="footnotemark">58</sup>
</a> or in the dead, or in those attained to the fourth jhāna, or in those born into a fine-material or immaterial existence, or in those attained to cessation [of perception and feeling]. So he should apostrophize himself thus: “You with all your wisdom are certainly not inside a mother’s womb or drowned in water or in the unconscious existence or dead or attained to the fourth jhāna or born into the fine-material or immaterial existence or attained to cessation. Those in-breaths and out-breath are actually existent in you, only you are not able to discern them because your understanding is dull.” Then, fixing his mind on the place normally touched [by the breaths], he should proceed to give his attention to that. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.210" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.210" ><b class="bfseries">§210.</b></a></a>  These in-breaths and out-breaths occur striking the tip of the nose in a long-nosed man <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[284]</i></span> and the upper lip in a short-nosed man. So he should fix the sign thus: “This is the place where they strike.” This was why the Blessed One said: “Bhikkhus, I do not say of one who is forgetful, who is not fully aware, [that he practices] development of mindfulness of breathing” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

But this mindfulness of breathing is difficult, difficult to develop, a field in which only the minds of Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, and Buddhas’ sons are at home. It is no trivial matter, nor can it be cultivated by trivial persons. In proportion as continued attention is given to it, it becomes more peaceful and more subtle. So strong mindfulness and understanding are necessary here. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.212" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.212" ><b class="bfseries">§212.</b></a></a>  Just as when doing needlework on a piece of fine cloth a fine needle is needed, and a still finer instrument for boring the needle’s eye, so too, when developing this meditation subject, which resembles fine cloth, both the mindfulness, which is the counterpart of the needle, and the understanding associated with it, which is the counterpart of the instrument for boring the needle’s eye, need to be strong. A bhikkhu must have the necessary mindfulness and understanding and must look for the in-breaths and out-breaths nowhere else than the place normally touched by them. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.213" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.213" ><b class="bfseries">§213.</b></a></a>  Suppose a ploughman, after doing some ploughing, sent his oxen free to graze and sat down to rest in the shade, then his oxen would soon go into the forest. Now, a skilled ploughman who wants to catch them and yoke them again does not wander through the forest following their tracks, but rather he takes his rope and goad and goes straight to the drinking place where they meet, and he sits or lies there. Then after the oxen have wandered about for a part of the day, they come to the drinking place where they meet and they bathe and drink, and when he sees that they have come out and are standing about, he secures them with the rope, and prodding them with the goad, he brings them back, yokes them, and goes on with his ploughing. So too, the bhikkhu should not look for the in-breaths and out-breaths anywhere else than the place normally touched by them. And he should take the rope of mindfulness and the goad of understanding, and fixing his mind on the place normally touched by them, he should go on giving his attention to that. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[285]</i></span> For as he gives his attention in this way they reappear after no long time, as the oxen did at the drinking place where they met. So he can secure them with the rope of mindfulness, and yoking them in that same place and prodding them with the goad of understanding, he can keep on applying himself to the meditation subject. </p>

<p><a name="VIII.215" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.215" ><b class="bfseries">§215.</b></a></a>  But this is the exposition given in the commentaries: It appears to some like a star or a cluster of gems or a cluster of pearls, to others with a rough touch like that of silk-cotton seeds or a peg made of heartwood, to others like a long braid string or a wreath of flowers or a puff of smoke, to others like a stretched-out<span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{336|278}</small></span> cobweb or a film of cloud or a lotus flower or a chariot wheel or the moon’s disk or the sun’s disk. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.216" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.216" ><b class="bfseries">§216.</b></a></a>  In fact this resembles an occasion when a number of bhikkhus are sitting together reciting a suttanta. When a bhikkhu asks, “What does this sutta appear like to you?” one says, “It appears to me like a great mountain torrent,” another “To me it is like a line of forest trees,” another “To me it is like a spreading fruit tree giving cool shade.” For the one sutta appears to them differently because of the difference in their perception. Similarly this single meditation subject appears differently because of difference in perception.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000703">

<p><em>5–8.</em> (See <a href="ch-14.html#VIII.189" >§189</a>) However, when a bhikkhu has achieved the fourfold and fivefold jhāna and wants to reach purity by developing the meditation subject through <em>observing </em>and through <em>turning away</em>, he should make that jhāna familiar by attaining mastery in it in the five ways (<a href="ch-10.html#IV.131" >IV.131</a>), and then embark upon insight by defining mentality-materiality. How? </p>
<p><a name="VIII.223" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.223" ><b class="bfseries">§223.</b></a></a>  On emerging from the attainment, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[287]</i></span> he sees that the in-breaths and out-breaths have the physical body and the mind as their origin; and that just as, when a blacksmith’s bellows are being blown, the wind moves owing to the bag and to the man’s appropriate effort, so too, in-breaths and out-breaths are due to the body and the mind. </p>
<p>Next, he defines the in-breaths and out-breaths and the body as “materiality,” and the consciousness and the states associated with the consciousness as “the immaterial [mind].” This is in brief (cf. <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p>His doubts being overcome, he attributes the three characteristics [beginning with that of suffering to mentality and materiality], comprehending [them] by groups (<a href="ch-27.html#XX.2" >XX.2f.</a>); he abandons the ten imperfections of insight beginning with illumination, which arise in the first stages of the contemplation of rise and fall (<a href="ch-27.html#XX.105" >XX.105f.</a>), and he defines as “the path” the knowledge of the way that is free from these imperfections (<a href="ch-27.html#XX.126" >XX.126f.</a>). </p>
<p>He reaches contemplation of dissolution by abandoning [attention to] arising. When all formations have appeared as terror owing to the contemplation of their incessant dissolution, he becomes dispassionate towards them (<a href="ch-28.html#XXI" >Ch.

<p><a name="VIII.228" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.228" ><b class="bfseries">§228.</b></a></a>  For this is said in the Paṭisambhidā: “When he knows unification of mind and non-distraction through long in-breaths, mindfulness is established in him.

<p>“It is experienced by him when he adverts, when he knows, sees, reviews, steadies his mind, resolves with faith, exerts energy, establishes mindfulness, concentrates his mind, understands with understanding, directly knows what is to be directly known, fully understands what is to be fully understood, abandons what is to be abandoned, develops what is to be developed, realizes what is to be realized.

The<em> experiencing </em>of bliss must be understood to be through three jhānas, and that of the <em>mental formation </em>through four. The mental formation consists of the two aggregates of feeling and perception. And in the case of the clause, <em>experiencing bliss</em>, it is said in the Paṭisambhidā in order to show the plane of insight here [as well]: “‘Bliss’: there are two kinds of bliss, bodily bliss and mental bliss” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

And this should be understood in detail in the same way as given under the bodily formation (see <a href="ch-14.html#VIII.176" >§§176</a>–<a href="ch-14.html#VIII.85" >85</a>). </p>
<p><a name="VIII.230" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.230" ><b class="bfseries">§230.</b></a></a>  Here, moreover, in the “happiness” clause feeling [which is actually being contemplated in this tetrad] is stated under the heading of “happiness” [which is a formation] but in the “bliss” clause feeling is stated in its own form. In the two “mental-formation” clauses the feeling is that [necessarily] associated with perception because of the words, “Perception and feeling belong to the mind, these things being bound up with the mind are mental formations” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<h2 id="a0000000208">3.5 Word Commentary Continued—Third Tetrad</h2>
<p><a name="VIII.231" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.231" ><b class="bfseries">§231.</b></a></a>  (ix) In the third tetrad the <em>experiencing </em>of the [<em>manner of] consciousness </em>must be understood to be through four jhānas. </p>
<p>(x) <em>Gladdening the [manner of] consciousness</em>: he trains thus: “Making the mind glad, instilling gladness into it, cheering it, rejoicing it, I shall breathe in, shall breathe out.” Herein, there is gladdening in two ways, through concentration and through insight. </p>
<p>How through concentration? He attains the two jhānas in which happiness is present. At the time when he has actually entered upon them he inspires the mind with gladness, instils gladness into it, by means of the happiness associated with the jhāna. How through insight? After entering upon and emerging from one of the two jhānas accompanied by happiness, he comprehends with insight that happiness associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall; thus at the actual time of insight he inspires the mind with gladness, instils gladness into it, by making the happiness associated with the jhāna the object. It is of one <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{340|282}</small></span>progressing in this way that the words, “He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in … shall breathe out gladdening the [manner of] consciousness,’” are said. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.232" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.232" ><b class="bfseries">§232.</b></a></a>  (xi) <em>Concentrating </em>(<em>samādahaṃ</em>) <em>the [manner of] consciousness</em>: evenly (<em>samaṃ</em>) placing (<em>ādahanto</em>) the mind, evenly putting it on its object by means of the first jhāna and so on. Or alternatively, when, having entered upon those jhānas and emerged from them, he comprehends with insight the consciousness associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall, then at the actual time of insight momentary unification of the mind<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000707">
  <sup class="footnotemark">64</sup>
</a> arises through the penetration of the characteristics [of impermanence, and so on]. Thus the words, “He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in … shall breathe out concentrating the [manner of] consciousness,’” are said also of one who evenly places the mind, evenly puts it on its object by means of the momentary unification of the mind arisen thus. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.233" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.233" ><b class="bfseries">§233.</b></a></a>  (xii) <em>Liberating the [manner of] consciousness</em>: he both breathes in and breathes out delivering, liberating, the mind from the hindrances by means of the first jhāna, from applied and sustained thought by means of the second, from happiness by means of the third, from pleasure and pain by means of the fourth. Or alternatively, when, having entered upon those jhānas and emerged from them, he comprehends with insight the consciousness associated with the jhāna as liable to destruction and to fall, then at the actual time of insight he delivers, liberates, the mind from the perception of permanence by means of the contemplation of impermanence, from the perception of pleasure by means of the contemplation of pain, from the perception of self by means of the contemplation of not self, from delight by means of the contemplation of dispassion, from greed by means of the contemplation of fading away, from arousing by means of the contemplation of cessation, from grasping by means of the contemplation of relinquishment. Hence it is said: <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[290]</i></span> “He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in … shall breathe out liberating the [manner of] consciousness.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000708">

</a> ’” So this tetrad should be understood to deal with contemplation of mind. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000209">3.6 Word Commentary Continued—Fourth Tetrad</h2>

<p>Herein, the five aggregates are <em>the impermanent</em>. Why? Because their essence is rise and fall and change. <em>Impermanence </em>is the rise and fall and change in those same aggregates, or it is their non-existence after having been; the meaning is, it is the breakup of produced aggregates through their momentary dissolution since they do not remain in the same mode. <em>Contemplation of impermanence </em>is contemplation of materiality, etc., as “impermanent” in virtue of that impermanence. <em>One contemplating impermanence </em>possesses that contemplation. So it is when one such as this is breathing in and breathing out that it can be understood of him: “He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in … shall breathe out contemplating impermanence.’”<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000709">

  <sup class="footnotemark">67</sup>
</a> Herein, “fading away as destruction” is the momentary dissolution of formations. “Absolute fading away” is Nibbāna. Contemplation of fading away is insight and it is the path, which occurs as the seeing of these two. It is when he possesses this twofold contemplation that it can be understood of him: “He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in … shall breathe out contemplating fading away.’” </p>
<p>(xv) The same method of explanation applies to the clause, <em>contemplating cessation</em>. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.236" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.236" ><b class="bfseries">§236.</b></a></a>  (xvi) <em>Contemplating relinquishment</em>: relinquishment is of two kinds too, that is to say, relinquishment as giving up, and relinquishment as entering into. Relinquishment itself as [a way of] contemplation is “contemplation of relinquishment.” For insight is called both “relinquishment as giving up” and “relinquishment as entering into” since [firstly], through substitution of opposite qualities, it gives up defilements with their aggregate-producing kamma formations, and [secondly], through seeing the wretchedness of what is formed, it also enters into Nibbāna by inclining towards Nibbāna, which is the opposite of the formed (<a href="ch-17.html#XI.18" >XI.18</a>). Also the path is called both “relinquishment as giving up” and “relinquishment as entering into” since it gives up defilements with their aggregate-producing kamma-formations by cutting them off, and it enters into Nibbāna by making it its object. Also both [insight and path knowledge] are called contemplation (<em>anupassanā</em>) because of their re-seeing successively (<em>anu anu passanā</em>) each preceding kind of knowledge.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000711">
  <sup class="footnotemark">68</sup>

<p><a name="VIII.237" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.237" ><b class="bfseries">§237.</b></a></a>  This tetrad deals only with pure insight while the previous three deal with serenity and insight.

<h2 id="a0000000210">3.7 Conclusion</h2>
<p>This mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases thus is of great fruit, of great benefit. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.238" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.238" ><b class="bfseries">§238.</b></a></a>  Its great beneficialness should be understood here as peacefulness both because of the words, “And, bhikkhus, this concentration through mindfulness of breathing, when developed and much practiced, is both peaceful and sublime” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>

</span>V 321</b>), etc., and because of its ability to cut off applied thoughts; for it is because it is peaceful, sublime, and an unadulterated blissful abiding that it cuts off the mind’s running hither and thither with applied thoughts obstructive to concentration, and keeps the mind only on the breaths as object. Hence it is said: “Mindfulness of breathing should be developed in order to cut off applied thoughts” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="VIII.239" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.239" ><b class="bfseries">§239.</b></a></a>  Also its great beneficialness should be understood as the root condition for the perfecting of clear vision and deliverance; for this has been said by the Blessed One: “Bhikkhus, mindfulness of breathing, when developed and much practiced, perfects the four foundations of mindfulness. The four foundations of mindfulness, when developed and much practiced, perfect the seven enlightenment factors.

<p><a name="VIII.240" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.240" ><b class="bfseries">§240.</b></a></a>  Again its great beneficialness should be understood to reside in the fact that it causes the final in-breaths and out-breaths to be known; for this is said by the Blessed One: “Rāhula, when mindfulness of breathing is thus developed, thus practiced much, the final in-breaths and out-breaths, too, are known as they cease, not unknown” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="VIII.241" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.241" ><b class="bfseries">§241.</b></a></a>  Herein, there are three kinds of [breaths that are] final because of cessation, that is to say, final in becoming, final in jhāna, and final in death. For, among the various kinds of becoming (existence), in-breaths and out-breaths occur in the sensual-sphere becoming, not in the fine-material and immaterial kinds of becoming. That is why there are final ones in becoming. In the jhānas they occur <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{344|286}</small></span>in the first three but not in the fourth. That is why there are final ones in jhāna. Those that arise along with the sixteenth consciousness preceding the death consciousness <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[292]</i></span> cease together with the death consciousness. They are called “final in death.” It is these last that are meant here by “final.” </p>
<p><a name="VIII.242" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.242" ><b class="bfseries">§242.</b></a></a>  When a bhikkhu has devoted himself to this meditation subject, it seems, if he adverts, at the moment of arising of the sixteenth consciousness before the death consciousness, to their arising, then their arising is evident to him; if he adverts to their presence, then their presence is evident to him; if he adverts to their dissolution, then their dissolution is evident to him; and it is so because he has thoroughly discerned in-breaths and out-breaths as object. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.243" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.243" ><b class="bfseries">§243.</b></a></a>  When a bhikkhu has attained Arahantship by developing some other meditation subject than this one, he may be able to define his life term or not. But when he has reached Arahantship by developing this mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases, he can always define his life term. He knows, “My vital formations will continue now for so long and no more.” Automatically he performs all the functions of attending to the body, dressing and robing, etc., after which he closes his eyes, like the Elder Tissa who lived at the Koṭapabbata Monastery, like the Elder Mahā Tissa who lived at the Mahā Karañjiya Monastery, like the Elder Tissa the alms-food eater in the kingdom of Devaputta, like the elders who were brothers and lived at the Cittalapabbata monastery. </p>
<p><a name="VIII.244" ><a href="ch-14.html#VIII.244" ><b class="bfseries">§244.</b></a></a>  Here is one story as an illustration. After reciting the Pātimokkha, it seems, on the Uposatha day of the full moon, one of the two elders who were brothers went to his own dwelling place surrounded by the Community of Bhikkhus. As he stood on the walk looking at the moonlight he calculated his own vital formations, and he said to the Community of Bhikkhus, “In what way have you seen bhikkhus attaining Nibbāna up till now?” Some answered, “Till now we have seen them attain Nibbāna sitting in their seats.” Others answered, “We have seen them sitting cross-legged in the air.” The elder said, “I shall now show you one attaining Nibbāna while walking.” He then drew a line on the walk, saying, “I shall go from this end of the walk to the other end and return; when I reach this line I shall attain Nibbāna.” So saying, he stepped on to the walk and went to the far end. On his return he attained Nibbāna in the same moment in which he stepped on the line. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[293]</i></span> </p>

But it should also be recollected according to the other special qualities of peace stated by the Blessed One in the suttas beginning with: “Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the unformed … the truth … the other shore … the hard-to-see … the undecaying … the lasting … the undiversified … the deathless … the auspicious … the safe … the marvellous … the intact … the unafflicted … the purity … the island … the shelter ….” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described under the recollection of the Enlightened One, etc., the jhāna factors arise in a single moment. But owing to the profundity of the special qualities of peace, or owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of various kinds, the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption.

Nevertheless, though this is so, ‘<em>the highest sense this concept will allow</em> (<em>paññatti paramatthiyā</em>)’—the ultimate sense will allow this concept of continuity, which is what the expression of common usage ‘Tissa lives, Phussa lives’ refers to, and which is based on consciousnesses [momentarily] existing along with a physical support; this belongs to the ultimate sense here, since, as they say, ‘It is not the name and surname that lives.’” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>242</b>, 801) 
Something may be said about the word <em>paññatti</em> here. Twenty-four kinds are dealt with in the commentary to the Puggalapaññatti. The Puggalapaññatti Schedule (<em>mātikā</em>) gives the following six <em>paññatti</em> (here a making known, a setting out): of aggregates, bases, elements, truths, faculties, and persons. (Pug 1) The commentary explains the word in this sense as <em>paññāpana</em> (making known) and <em>ṭhapana</em> (placing), quoting “He announces, teaches, declares (<em>paññāpeti</em>), establishes” (cf. <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#M" >M</a>
	]
</span>III 248</b>), and also “a well-appointed (<em>supaññatta</em>) bed and chair” (?). It continues: “The making known of a name (<em>nāma-paññatti</em>) shows such and such dhammas and places them in such and such compartments, while the making known of the aggregates (<em>khandha-paññatti</em>) and the rest shows in brief the individual form of those making-known (<em>paññatti</em>).” 
It then gives six kinds of <em>paññatti</em> “according to the commentarial method but not in the texts”: (1) <em>Concept of the existent</em> (<em>vijjamāna-paññatti</em>), which is the conceptualizing of (making known) a dhamma that is existent, actual, become, in the true and ultimate sense (e.g. aggregates, etc.). (2) <em>Concept of the non-existent</em>, which is, for example, the conceptualizing of “female,” “male,” “persons,” etc., which are non-existent by that standard and are only established by means of current speech in the world; similarly “such impossibilities as concepts of a fifth truth or the other sectarians’ Atom, Primordial Essence, World Soul, and the like.” (3) <em>Concept of the non-existent based on the existent</em>, e.g. the expression, “One with the three clear-visions,” where the “person” (“one”) is nonexistent and the “clear-visions” are existent. (4)<em> Concept of the existent based on the non-existent</em>, e.g. the “female form,” “visible form” (= visible datum base) being existent and “female” non-existent. (5) <em>Concept of the existent</em> based on the existent, e.g. “eye-contact,” both “eye” and “contact” being existent. (6) <em>Concept of the non-existent based on the non-existent</em>, e.g. “banker’s son,” both being non-existent. 
Again two more sets of six are given as “according to the Teachers, but not in the Commentaries.” The first is: (1) <em>Derivative concept</em> (<em>upādā-paññatti</em>); this, for instance, is a “being,” which is a convention derived from the aggregates of materiality, feeling, etc., though it has no individual essence of its own apprehendable in the true ultimate sense, as materiality, say, has in its self-identity and its otherness from feeling, etc.; or a “house” or a “fist” or an “oven” as apart from its component parts, or a “pitcher” or a “garment,” which are all derived from those same aggregates; or “time” or “direction,” which are derived from the revolutions of the moon and sun; or the “learning sign” or “counterpart sign” founded on some aspect or other, which are a convention derived from some real sign as a benefit of meditative development: these are derived concepts, and this kind is a “concept” (<em>paññatti</em>) in the sense of “ability to be set up” (<em>paññāpetabba</em> = ability to be conceptualized), but not in the sense of “making known” (<em>paññāpana</em>). Under the latter heading this would be a “concept of the nonexistent.” (2) <em>Appositional concept</em> (<em>upa-nidhā-p</em>.): many varieties are listed, namely, apposition of reference (“second” as against “first,” “third” as against “second,” “long” as against “short”); apposition of what is in the hand (“umbrella-in-hand,” “knife-in-hand”); apposition of association (“earring-wearer,” “topknot-wearer,” “crest-wearer”); apposition of contents (“corn-wagon,” “ghee-pot”); apposition of proximity (“Indasālā Cave,” “Piyaṅgu Cave”); apposition of comparison (“golden coloured,” “with a bull’s gait”); apposition of majority (“Padumassara-brahman Village”); apposition of distinction (“diamond ring”); and so on. (3) <em>Collective concept </em>(<em>samodhāna-p</em>.), e.g., “eight-footed,” “pile of riches.” (4) <em>Additive concept</em> (<em>upanikkhitta-p</em>.), e.g. “one,” “two,” “three.” (5) <em>Verisimilar concept</em> (<em>tajjā-p</em>.): refers to the individual essence of a given dhamma, e.g. “earth,” “fire,” “hardness,” “heat.” (6) <em>Continuity concept</em> (<em>santati-p</em>.): refers to the length of continuity of life, e.g. “octogenarian,” “nonagenarian.” 
In the second set there are: (i) <em>Concept according to function</em> (<em>kicca-p</em>.), e.g. “preacher,” “expounder of Dhamma.” (ii) <em>Concept according to shape</em> (<em>saṇṭhāna-p.</em>), e.g. “thin,” “stout,” “round,” “square.” (iii) <em>Concept according to gender</em> (<em>liṅga-p</em>.), e.g. “female,” “male.” (iv) <em>Concept according to location</em> (<em>bhūmi-p</em>.), e.g. “of the sense sphere,” “Kosalan.” (v) <em>Concept as proper name</em> (<em>paccatta-p</em>.), e.g. “Tissa,” “Nāga,” “Sumana,” which are making-known (appellations) by mere name-making. (vi) <em>Concept of the unformed</em> (<em>asaṅkhata-paññatti</em>), e.g. “cessation,” “Nibbāna,” etc., which make the unformed dhamma known—an existent concept. (From commentary to <em>Puggalapaññatti</em>, condensed—see also <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

For dissolution is the furthest extreme of impermanence. So the meditator who is contemplating dissolution by its means sees under the heading of consciousness the whole field of formations as impermanent, not as permanent; and because of the suffering inherent in what is impermanent, and because of the absence of self in what is painful, he sees that same whole field of formations as painful, not as pleasant, and as not-self, not as self. But since what is impermanent, painful, and not-self is not something to delight in, and what is not something to delight in is not something to be greedy for, consequently he becomes dispassionate towards that whole field of formations when it is seen in the light of dissolution as impermanent, painful, not-self, he does not delight in it, and his greed for it fades away, does not dye him. Now, as he thus becomes dispassionate and his greed fades away, it is firstly by means of mundane knowledge only that he causes greed to cease and does not arouse it. The meaning is that he does not bring about its arising. Or alternatively, his greed having thus faded away, he causes by means of his own knowledge the cessation of the unseen field of formations just as that of the seen, he does not arouse it; the meaning is that he brings about only its cessation, he does not bring about its arising. Having entered on this way, he relinquishes, he does not grasp. What is meant? It is that this contemplation of impermanence, etc., is called relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into because it gives up defilements along with aggregate-producing kamma-formations and because, by seeing the flaws in what is formed and by inclining towards the opposite of what is formed, namely Nibbāna, it enters into that Nibbāna. Consequently the meditator who has that contemplation gives up defilements and enters into Nibbāna in the way stated. Herein, the contemplation of what is impermanent as only impermanent is ‘contemplation of impermanence’; this is a name for insight that occurs by taking formations of the three [mundane] planes [and leaving aside the supramundane] as impermanent. ‘From the perception of permanence’: from the wrong perception that occurs perceiving formed things as permanent, eternal; also the various views should be regarded as included under the heading of perception. Likewise with the perception of pleasure and so on. ‘By means of the contemplation of dispassion’: by means of the contemplation that occurs in the mode of dispassion for formations. ‘From delight’: from craving accompanied by happiness. ‘By means of the contemplation of fading away’: by means of the contemplation that occurs similarly in the mode of fading away; hence ‘delivering from greed’ is said. ‘By means of the contemplation of cessation’: by means of the successive seeing of formations’ cessation. Or contemplating cessation is contemplation such that formations cease only and do not arise with future renewal. For this is knowledge of desire for deliverance grown strong. Hence he said, ‘delivering from arousing.’ Contemplation that occurs in the mode of relinquishing is ‘contemplation of relinquishment.’ ‘From grasping’: from taking as permanent, etc.; or the meaning can also here be regarded as ‘from grasping rebirth-linking.’ (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

And the giving up in this way is in the form of inducing non-occurrence. For all kamma-formations that are rooted in defilements due to apprehending (formations) as permanent, and the kamma-resultant aggregates rooted in both which might arise in the future, are abandoned by causing their non-occurrence. Likewise in the case of perception of pain, and so on. ‘Through seeing the wretchedness of what is formed’: through seeing the fault of impermanence, etc., in the formed three-plane field of formations.

It is extensively used for exegetical purposes in the <em>Visuddhimagga</em> and main commentaries and likewise in the subcommentaries. As has just been shown, it is narrower than dhamma (see also <a href="ch-30.html#XXIII" >Ch. XXIII</a>. n. 18). It often roughly corresponds to <em>dhātu</em> (element—see e.g. <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

The <em>Atthasālinī </em>observes: “It is the individual essence, or the generality, of such and such dhammas that is called their characteristic” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Dhs-a" >Dhs-a</a>

</span>63</b>); on which the <em>Mūla Ṭīkā</em> comments: “The <em>individual essence</em> consisting in, say, hardness as that of earth, or touching as that of contact, is not common to all dhammas. The <em>generality</em> is the individual essence common to all consisting in impermanence, etc.; also in this context (i.e. <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Dhs" >Dhs</a>
	]
</span>§1</b>) the characteristic of being profitable may be regarded as general because it is the individual <em>essence </em>common to all that is profitable; or alternatively it is their individual <em>essence</em> because it is not common to the unprofitable and indeterminate [kinds of consciousness]” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Dhs-a" >Dhs-a</a>
	]
</span>63</b>). The individual <em>essence</em> of any formed dhamma is manifested in the three instants of its existence (<em>atthitā, vijjamānatā</em>), namely, arising, presence (= aging) and dissolution. It comes from nowhere and goes nowhere (<a href="ch-22.html#XV.15" >XV.15</a>) and is borne by the mind. Dhammas without individual essence (<em>asabhāvadhamma</em>) include the attainment of cessation (see <a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.n18" >Ch. XXIII, n. 18</a>) and some concepts. Space and time belong to the last-mentioned. Of space (<em>ākāsa</em>) the <em>Majjhima Nikāya Ṭīkā</em> says: “Space, which is quite devoid of individual essence, is called empty” (commenting on MN 106), while of time (<em>kāla</em>) the <em>Mūla Ṭīkā </em>says: “Though time is determined by the kind of consciousness [e.g. as specified in the first paragraph of the Dhammasaṅgaṇī] and is non-existent (<em>avijjamāna</em>) as to individual essence, yet as the non-entity (<em>abhāva</em>) before and after the moment in which those [conascent and co-present] dhammas occur, it is called the ‘container (<em>adhikaraṇa</em>)’; it is perceived (symbolized) only as the state of a receptacle (<em>ādhāra-bhāva</em>) (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Dhs-a" >Dhs-a</a>
	]
</span>62</b>). Of Nibbāna (for which see <a href="ch-23.html#XVI.46" >XVI.46ff.</a>), which has its own individual essence, the <em>Mūla Ṭīkā</em> says “Nibbāna is not like other dhammas; because of its extreme profundity it cannot be made an object of consciousness (<em>ālambituṃ</em>) by one who has not realized it. That is why it has to be realized by change-of-lineage. It has profundity surpassing any individual essence belonging to the three periods of time” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Vibh-a" >Vibh-a</a>

</span>38</b>). 
<em>Sabhāva</em> has not the extreme vagueness of its parent <em>bhāva,</em> which can mean anything between “essence” (see e.g. <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Dhs-a" >Dhs-a</a>
	]
</span>61</b>) and “-ness” (e.g. <em>natthibhāva</em> = non-existingness—<a href="ch-16.html#X.35" >X.35</a>). This may be remembered when <em>sabhāva</em> is defined as above thus: “It is with essence (<em>sahabhāvena</em>), thus it is individual essence (<em>sabhāva</em>)” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Vism-mhṭ" >Vism-mhṭ</a>
	]
</span>282</b>), and when it is defined again thus: “A dhamma’s own essence or its existing essence (<em>sako vā bhāvo samāno vā bhāvo</em>) is its individual essence (<em>sabhāva</em>)” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Vism-mhṭ" >Vism-mhṭ</a>
	]
</span>433</b>). <em>Sabhāva </em>can also be the basis of a wrong view, if regarded as the sole efficient cause or condition of any formed thing (<a href="ch-23.html#XVI.n23" >Ch. XVI, n.23</a>). The Sanskrit equivalent, <em>svabhāva</em>, had a great vogue and checkered history in philosophical discussions on the Indian mainland. 
This (unlike the word, <em>dhamma,</em> which has many “referents”) is an instance in which it is of first importance to stick to one rendering. The word is a purely exegetical one; consequently vagueness is undesirable. “Individual essence” has been chosen principally on etymological grounds, and the word “essence” (an admittedly slippery customer) must be understood from the contexts in which it is used and not prejudged. Strictly it refers here to the triple moment of arising etc., of formed dhammas that can have such “existence” in their own right and be experienced as such; and it refers to the realizability of Nibbāna. We are here in the somewhat magical territory of ontology, a subject that is at present undergoing one of its periodical upheavals in Europe, this time in the hands of the existentialists. Consequently it is important to approach the subject with an open mind.</li>
