<p>This was said. But why was it said? While the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī, it seems, a certain deity came to him in the night, and in order to do away with his doubts, he asked this question: </p>

<p><a name="I.2" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.2" ><b class="bfseries">§2.</b></a></a>  Here is the meaning in brief. <em>Tangle </em>is a term for the network of craving. For that is a tangle in the sense of lacing together, like the tangle called network of branches in bamboo thickets, etc., because it goes on arising again and again up and down<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000439">
  <sup class="footnotemark">1</sup>
</a> among the objects [of consciousness] beginning with what is visible. But it is called <em>the inner tangle and the outer tangle </em>because it arises [as craving] for one’s own requisites and another’s, for one’s own person and another’s, and for the internal and external bases [for consciousness]. Since it arises in this way, <em>this generation is entangled in a tangle. </em>As the bamboos, etc., are entangled by the bamboo tangle, etc., so too this generation, in other words, this order of living beings, is all entangled by the tangle of craving—the meaning is that it is intertwined, interlaced by it. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[2]</i></span> And because it is entangled like this, <em>so I ask of Gotama this question, </em>that is why I ask this.

</span>II 290</b>); and similarly in the case of the right efforts, and so on. But in the answer to this question it is taught by virtue and the other two. </p>
<p><a name="I.7" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.7" ><b class="bfseries">§7.</b></a></a>  Here is a brief commentary [on the stanza]. <em>Established well in virtue</em>: standing on virtue. It is only one actually fulfilling virtue who is here said to “stand on virtue.” So the meaning here is this: being established well in virtue by fulfilling virtue. <em>A man: </em>a living being. <em>Wise: </em>possessing the kind of understanding that is born of kamma by means of a rebirth-linking with triple root-cause. <em>Develops consciousness and understanding</em>: develops both concentration and insight. For it is concentration that is described here under the heading of “consciousness,” and insight under that of “understanding.”<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000442">
  <sup class="footnotemark">4</sup>
</a> <em>Ardent </em>(<em>ātāpin</em>): possessing energy. For it is energy that is called “ardour” (<em>ātāpa</em>) in the sense of burning up and consuming (<em>ātāpana-paritāpana</em>) defilements. He has that, thus he is ardent. <em>Sagacious: </em>it is <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{66|8}</small></span>understanding that is called “sagacity”; possessing that, is the meaning. This word shows protective understanding. For understanding is mentioned three times in the reply to the question. Herein, the first is naïve understanding, the second is understanding consisting in insight, while the third is the protective understanding that guides all affairs. He sees fear (<em>bhayaṃ ikkhati</em>) in the round of rebirths, thus he is a <em>bhikkhu. He succeeds in disentangling this tangle</em>: <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[4]</i></span> Just as a man standing on the ground and taking up a well-sharpened knife might disentangle a great tangle of bamboos, so too, he—this bhikkhu who possesses the six things, namely, this virtue, and this concentration described under the heading of consciousness, and this threefold understanding, and this ardour—standing on the ground of virtue and taking up with the hand of protective-understanding exerted by the power of energy the knife of insight-understanding well-sharpened on the stone of concentration, might disentangle, cut away and demolish all the tangle of craving that had overgrown his own life’s continuity. But it is at the moment of the path that he is said to be disentangling that tangle; at the moment of fruition he has disentangled the tangle and is worthy of the highest offerings in the world with its deities. That is why the Blessed One said: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> “When a wise man, established well in virtue,<br /> Develops consciousness and understanding,<br /> Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious<br /> He succeeds in disentangling this tangle.” </blockquote>
<p><a name="I.8" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.8" ><b class="bfseries">§8.</b></a></a>  Herein there is nothing for him to do about the [naïve] understanding on account of which he is called <em>wise</em>; for that has been established in him simply by the influence of previous kamma. But the words <em>ardent </em>and<em> sagacious </em>mean that by persevering with energy of the kind here described and by acting in full awareness with understanding he should, having become well established in virtue, develop the serenity and insight that are described as <em>concentration </em>and<em> understanding. </em>This is how the Blessed One shows the path of purification under the headings of virtue, concentration, and understanding there. </p>
<p><a name="I.9" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.9" ><b class="bfseries">§9.</b></a></a>  What has been shown so far is the three trainings, the dispensation that is good in three ways, the necessary condition for the threefold clear-vision, etc., the avoidance of the two extremes and the cultivation of the middle way, the means to surmounting the states of loss, etc., the abandoning of defilements in three aspects, prevention of transgression etc., purification from the three kinds of defilements, and the reason for the states of stream-entry and so on. How? </p>
<p><a name="I.10" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.10" ><b class="bfseries">§10.</b></a></a>  Here the training of higher virtue is shown by <em>virtue; </em>the training of higher consciousness, by <em>concentration; </em>and the training of higher understanding, by <em>understanding.</em> </p>

Its goodness in the end is shown by <em>understanding. </em>Because of the passage, “The purifying of one’s own mind—this is the Buddhas’ dispensation” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Dhp" >Dhp</a>

<p><a name="I.11" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.11" ><b class="bfseries">§11.</b></a></a>  Likewise the necessary condition for the triple clear-vision is shown by <em>virtue. </em>For with the support of perfected virtue one arrives at the three kinds of clear-vision, but nothing besides that. The necessary condition for the six kinds of direct-knowledge is shown by <em>concentration. </em>For with the support of perfected concentration one arrives at the six kinds of direct-knowledge, but nothing besides that.

<p>And the avoidance of the extreme called devotion to indulgence of sense desires is shown by <em>virtue. </em>The avoidance of the extreme called devotion to mortification of self is shown by <em>concentration. </em>The cultivation of the middle way is shown by <em>understanding.</em> </p>
<p><a name="I.12" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.12" ><b class="bfseries">§12.</b></a></a>  <em>Likewise the means for surmounting the states of loss is shown by virtue</em>; the means for surmounting the element of sense desires, by <em>concentration; </em>and the means for surmounting all becoming, by <em>understanding.</em> </p>

<p><a name="I.13" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.13" ><b class="bfseries">§13.</b></a></a>  <em>Likewise prevention of defilements’ transgression is shown by virtue; </em>prevention of obsession (by defilement) is shown by <em>concentration; </em>prevention of inherent tendencies is shown by <em>understanding.</em> </p>

<p><a name="I.16" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  However, even when this path of purification is shown in this way under the headings of virtue, concentration and understanding, each comprising various special qualities, it is still only shown extremely briefly. And so since that is insufficient to help all, there is, in order to show it in detail, the following set of questions dealing in the first place with virtue: </p>
<ol class="enumerate" style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
  <li><p>What is virtue? </p>
</li>
  <li><p>In what sense is it virtue? </p>

</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="I.17" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.17" ><b class="bfseries">§17.</b></a></a>  Here are the answers: </p>
<h1 id="a0000000057">3 (i) What is virtue?</h1>
<p>It is the states beginning with volition present in one who abstains from killing living things, etc., or in one who fulfils the practice of the duties. For this is said in the Paṭisambhidā: “What is virtue? There is virtue as volition, virtue as consciousness-concomitant,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000445">
  <sup class="footnotemark">7</sup>
</a> virtue as restraint, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[7]</i></span> virtue as non-transgression” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	<a href="ch-03.html#Paṭis" >Paṭis</a>

</span>I 44</b>). </p>
<p>Herein, <em>virtue as volition </em>is the volition present in one who abstains from killing living things, etc., or in one who fulfils the practice of the duties. <em>Virtue as consciousness-concomitant </em>is the abstinence in one who abstains from killing living things, and so on. Furthermore, <em>virtue as volition </em>is the seven volitions [that accompany the first seven] of the [ten] courses of action (kamma) in one who abandons the killing of living things, and so on. <em>Virtue as consciousness-concomitant </em>is the [three remaining] states consisting of non-covetousness, non-ill will, and right view, stated in the way beginning, “Abandoning covetousness, he dwells with a mind free from covetousness” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

Herein, “restraint by the Pātimokkha” is this: “He is furnished, fully furnished, with this Pātimokkha restraint. (Vibh 246)” “Restraint by mindfulness” is this: “He guards the eye faculty, enters upon restraint of the eye faculty” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#D" >D</a>
	]
</span>I 70</b>). “Restraint by knowledge” is this: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> “The currents in the world that flow, Ajita,” said the Blessed One,<br /> “Are stemmed by means of mindfulness;<br /> Restraint of currents I proclaim,<br /> By understanding they are dammed” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	<a href="ch-03.html#Sn" >Sn</a>

<p>and use of requisites is here combined with this. But what is called “restraint by patience” is that given in the way beginning, “He is one who bears cold and heat” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#M" >M</a>
	]
</span>I 10</b>). And what is called “restraint by energy” is that given in the way beginning, “He does not endure a thought of sense desires when it arises” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#M" >M</a>
	]
</span>I 11</b>); purification of livelihood is here combined with this. So this fivefold restraint, and the abstinence, in clansmen who dread evil, from any chance of transgression met with, should all be understood to be “virtue as restraint.” </p>
<p><em>Virtue as non-transgression </em>is the non-transgression, by body or speech, of precepts of virtue that have been undertaken. </p>
<p>This, in the first place, is the answer to the question, “What is virtue?” <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[8]</i></span> Now, </p>
<h1 id="a0000000058">4 (ii) In what sense is it virtue?</h1>
<p><a name="I.19" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.19" ><b class="bfseries">§19.</b></a></a>  as to the rest— (ii) <span class="scshape">In what sense is it virtue?</span> It is virtue (<em>sīla</em>) in the sense of composing (<em>sīlana</em>).<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000446">
  <sup class="footnotemark">8</sup>
</a> What is this composing? It is either a coordinating (<em>samādhāna</em>), meaning non-inconsistency of bodily action, etc., due to virtuousness; or it is an upholding (<em>upadhāraṇa</em>),<a class="footnote" href="#footnotes">
  <sup class="footnotemark">0</sup>
</a> meaning a state of basis (<em>ādhāra</em>) owing to its serving as foundation for profitable states. For those who understand etymology admit only these two meanings. Others, however, comment on the meaning here in the way beginning, “The meaning of virtue (<em>sīla</em>) is the meaning of head (<em>sira</em>), the meaning of virtue is the meaning of cool (<em>sītala</em>).” </p>
<h1 id="a0000000059">5 (iii) What are its characteristic, etc.?</h1>
<p><a name="I.20" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.20" ><b class="bfseries">§20.</b></a></a>  (iii) Now, <span class="scshape">what are its characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause?</span> Here: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> The characteristic of it is composing<br /> Even when analyzed in various ways,<br /> As visibility is of visible data<br /> Even when analyzed in various ways. </blockquote>
<p>Just as visibleness is the characteristic of the visible-data base even when analyzed into the various categories of blue, yellow, etc., because even when analyzed into these categories it does not exceed visible-ness, so also this same composing, described above as the coordinating of bodily action, etc., and as the foundation of <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{70|12}</small></span>profitable states, is the characteristic of virtue even when analyzed into the various categories of volition, etc., because even when analyzed into these categories it does not exceed the state of coordination and foundation. </p>
<p><a name="I.21" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.21" ><b class="bfseries">§21.</b></a></a>  While such is its characteristic: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> Its function has a double sense:<br /> <em>Action</em> to stop misconduct, then<br /> <em>Achievement</em> as the quality<br /> Of blamelessness in virtuous men. </blockquote>

On the contrary when a visible datum as object comes into the eye’s focus, then, after the life-continuum has arisen twice and ceased, the functional mind-element accomplishing the function of adverting arises and ceases. After that, eye-consciousness with the function of seeing; after that, resultant mind-element with the function of receiving; after that, resultant root-causeless mind-consciousness-element with the function of investigating; after that, functional root-causeless mind-consciousness-element accomplishing the function of determining arises and ceases.

</a> Herein, there is neither restraint nor non-restraint on the occasion of the life-continuum, or on any of the occasions beginning with adverting. But there is non-restraint if unvirtuousness or forgetfulness or unknowing or impatience or idleness arises at the moment of impulsion. When this happens, it is called “non-restraint in the eye faculty.” <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[22]</i></span> </p>
<p><a name="I.58" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.58" ><b class="bfseries">§58.</b></a></a>  Why is that? Because when this happens, the door is not guarded, nor are the life-continuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series. Like what? Just as, when a city’s four gates are not secured, although inside the city house doors, storehouses, rooms, etc., are secured, yet all property inside the city is unguarded and unprotected since robbers coming in by the city gates can do as they please, so too, when unvirtuousness, etc., arise in impulsion in which there is no restraint, then the door too is unguarded, and so also are the life-continuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with adverting. But when virtue, etc., has arisen in it, then the door too is guarded and so also are the life-continuum and the consciousnesses of <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{83|25}</small></span>the cognitive series beginning with adverting. Like what? Just as, when the city gates are secured, although inside the city the houses, etc., are not secured, yet all property inside the city is well guarded, well protected, since when the city gates are shut there is no ingress for robbers, so too, when virtue, etc., have arisen in impulsion, the door too is guarded and so also are the life-continuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series beginning with adverting.

Or the cure for the sick itself as medicine is “medicine as cure for the sick.” Any work of a medical man such as oil, honey, ghee, etc., that is suitable for one who is sick, is what is meant. A “requisite” (<em>parikkhāra</em>), however, in such passages as “It is well supplied with the requisites of a city” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

For that medicine as a cure for the sick is equipment for maintaining life because it protects by preventing the arising of affliction destructive to life; and it is an accessory too because it is an instrument for prolonging life. That is why it is called “requisite.” So it is medicine as cure for the sick and that is a requisite, thus it is a “requisite of medicine as cure for the sick.” [He makes use of] that requisite of medicine as cure <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{93|35}</small></span>for the sick; any requisite for life consisting of oil, honey, molasses, ghee, etc., that is allowed by a medical man as suitable for the sick, is what is meant. </p>

<p>This is how this <em>virtue concerning requisites </em>should be understood. In brief its characteristic is the use of requisites after wise reflection.

<p>It seems that robbers in the Mahāvaṭṭanī Forest bound an elder with black creepers and made him lie down.

Now, today, I know it through those who have eyes.” The elder, it seems, though he had lived there for so long, had never raised his eyes and looked up at the cave.

Herein, use by one who is unvirtuous and makes use [of requisites], even sitting in the midst of the Community, is called “use as theft.” Use without reviewing by one who is virtuous is “use as a debt”; therefore the robe should be reviewed every time it is used, and the alms food lump by lump. One who cannot do this [should review it] before the meal, after the meal, in the first watch, in the middle watch, and in the last watch. If dawn breaks on him without his having reviewed it, he finds himself in the position of one who has used it as a debt. Also the resting place should be reviewed each time it is used. Recourse to mindfulness both in the accepting and the use of medicine is proper; but while this is so, though there is an offence for one who uses it without mindfulness after mindful acceptance, there is no offence for one who is mindful in using after accepting without mindfulness. </p>

Herein, <em>virtue of </em><span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{100|42}</small></span><em>the Pātimokkha restraint </em>is called “purification by the Teaching”; <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[44]</i></span> for that is so called because it purifies by means of teaching. <em>Virtue of restraint of faculties </em>is called “purification by restraint”; for that is so called because it purifies by means of the restraint in the mental resolution, “I shall not do so again.” <em>Virtue of livelihood purification </em>is called “purification by search”; for that is so called because search is purified in one who abandons wrong search and gets requisites lawfully and properly. <em>Virtue dependent on requisites </em>is called “purification by reviewing”; for that is so called because it purifies by the reviewing of the kind already described. Hence it was said above (<a href="ch-06.html#I.125" >§125</a>): “There is no offence for one who is mindful in using after accepting without mindfulness.” </p>
<p><a name="I.127" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.127" ><b class="bfseries">§127.</b></a></a>  Use of the requisites by the seven kinds of trainers is called “use as an inheritance”; for they are the Buddha’s sons, therefore they make use of the requisites as the heirs of requisites belonging to their father. But how then, is it the Blessed One’s requisites or the laity’s requisites that are used? Although given by the laity, they actually belong to the Blessed One, because it is by the Blessed One that they are permitted. That is why it should be understood that the Blessed One’s requisites are used. The confirmation here is in the Dhammadāyāda Sutta (MN 3). </p>
<p>Use by those whose cankers are destroyed is called “use as a master”; for they make use of them as masters because they have escaped the slavery of craving. </p>
<p><a name="I.128" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.128" ><b class="bfseries">§128.</b></a></a>  As regards these kinds of use, use as a master and use as an inheritance are allowable for all. Use as a debt is not allowable, to say nothing of use as theft. But this use of what is reviewed by one who is virtuous is use freed from debt because it is the opposite of use as a debt or is included in use as an inheritance too. For one possessed of virtue is called a trainer too because of possessing this training. </p>
<p><a name="I.129" ><a href="ch-06.html#I.129" ><b class="bfseries">§129.</b></a></a>  As regards these three kinds of use, since use as a master is best, when a bhikkhu undertakes <em>virtue dependent on requisites</em>, he should aspire to that and use them after reviewing them in the way described. And this is said: <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[45]</i></span> </p>

Why? Because the eye has no thought (<em>acetanattā</em>). And then, were consciousness itself to see a visible object, it would see it even behind a wall because of being independent of sense resistance (<em>appaṭighabhāvato</em>); but that is not so either because there is no seeing in all kinds of consciousness. And herein, it is consciousness dependent on the eye that sees, not just any kind. And that does not arise with respect to what is enclosed by walls, etc., where light is excluded. But where there is no exclusion of light, as in the case of a crystal or a mass of cloud, there it does arise even with respect to what is enclosed by them. So it is as a basis of consciousness that the eye sees. 
“‘<em>When there is the impingement of door and object</em>’: what is intended is: when a visible datum as object has come into the eye’s focus. ‘<em>One sees</em>’: one looks (<em>oloketi</em>); for when the consciousness that has eye-sensitivity as its material support is disclosing (<em>obhāsente</em>) by means of the special quality of its support a visible datum as object that is assisted by light (<em>āloka</em>), then it is said that a person possessed of that sees the visible datum. And here the illuminating is the revealing of the visible datum according to its individual essence, in other words, the apprehending of it experientially (<em>paccakkhato</em>). 
“Here it is the ‘<em>sign of woman</em>’ because it is the cause of perceiving as ‘woman’ all such things as the shape that is grasped under the heading of the visible data (materiality) invariably found in a female continuity, the un-clear-cut-ness (<em>avisadatā</em>) of the flesh of the breasts, the beardlessness of the face, the use of cloth to bind the hair, the un-clear-cut stance, walk, and so on. The ‘<em>sign of man</em>’ is in the opposite sense. 
“‘<em>The sign of beauty</em>’ here is the aspect of woman that is the cause for the arising of lust. By the word ‘etc.’ the sign of resentment (<em>paṭigha</em>), etc., are included, which should be understood as the undesired aspect that is the cause for the arising of hate. And here admittedly only covetousness and grief are specified in the text but the sign of equanimity needs to be included too; since there is non-restraint in the delusion that arises due to overlooking, or since ‘forgetfulness of unknowing’ is said below (§57). And here the ‘sign of equanimity’ should be understood as an object that is the basis for the kind of equanimity associated with unknowing through overlooking it. So ‘<em>the sign of beauty</em>, etc.’ given in brief thus is actually the cause of greed, hate, and delusion. “‘<em>He stops at what is merely seen</em>’: according to the Sutta method, ‘The seen shall be merely seen’ (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

As soon as the colour basis has been apprehended by the consciousnesses of the cognitive series with eye-consciousness he stops; he does not fancy any aspect of beauty, etc., beyond that….
