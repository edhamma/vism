<h1 id="a0000000259">1 (2) The Divine Ear Element</h1>
<p><a name="XIII.1" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.1" ><b class="bfseries">§1.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{458|400}</small></span><span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[407]</i></span> It is now the turn for the description of the divine ear element. Herein, and also in the case of the remaining three kinds of direct-knowledge, the meaning of the passage beginning, “When his concentrated mind …” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#D" >D</a>
	]
</span>I 79</b>) should be understood in the way already stated (<a href="ch-18.html#XII.13" >XII.13f.</a>); and in each case we shall only comment on what is different. [The text is as follows: “He directs, he inclines, his mind to the divine ear element. With the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human, those that are far as well as near”(<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>I 79</b>).] </p>
<p><a name="XIII.2" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.2" ><b class="bfseries">§2.</b></a></a>  Herein, <em>with the divine ear element</em>: it is <em>divine</em> here because of its similarity to the divine; for deities have as the divine ear element the sensitivity that is produced by kamma consisting in good conduct and is unimpeded by bile, phlegm, blood, etc., and capable of receiving an object even though far off because it is liberated from imperfections. And this ear element consisting in knowledge, which is produced by the power of this bhikkhu’s energy in development, is similar to that, so it is “divine” because it is similar to the divine. Furthermore, it is “divine” because it is obtained by means of divine abiding and because it has divine abiding as its support. And it is an “ear element” (<em>sota-dhātu</em>) in the sense of hearing (<em>savana</em>) and in the sense of being a soulless [element]. Also it is an “ear element” because it is like the ear element in its performance of an ear element’s function. With that divine ear element … he hears … </p>
<p><em>Which is purified</em>: which is quite pure through having no imperfection. <em>And surpasses the human</em>: which in the hearing of sounds surpasses, stands beyond, the human ear element by surpassing the human environment. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.3" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.3" ><b class="bfseries">§3.</b></a></a>  <em>He hears both kinds of sounds</em>: he hears the two kinds of sounds. What two? The divine and the human: the sounds of deities and of human beings, is what is meant. This should be understood as partially inclusive. <em>Those that are far as well as near</em>: what is meant is that he hears sounds that are far off, even in another world-sphere, and those that are near, even the sounds of the creatures living in his own body. This should be understood as completely inclusive. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.4" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  But how is this [divine ear element] aroused? The bhikkhu <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[408]</i></span> should attain jhāna as basis for direct-knowledge and emerge. Then, with the <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{459|401}</small></span>consciousness belonging to the preliminary-work concentration,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000819">
  <sup class="footnotemark">1</sup>
</a> he should advert first to the gross sounds in the distance normally within range of hearing: the sound in the forest of lions, etc., or in the monastery the sound of a gong, the sound of a drum, the sound of a conch, the sound of recitation by novices and young bhikkhus reciting with full vigour, the sound of their ordinary talk such as “What, venerable sir?”, “What, friend?”, etc., the sound of birds, the sound of wind, the sound of footsteps, the fizzing sound of boiling water, the sound of palm leaves drying in the sun, the sound of ants, and so on. Beginning in this way with quite gross sounds, he should successively advert to more and more subtle sounds. He should give attention to the sound sign of the sounds in the eastern direction, in the western direction, in the northern direction, in the southern direction, in the upper direction, in the lower direction, in the eastern intermediate direction, in the western intermediate direction, in the northern intermediate direction, and in the southern intermediate direction. He should give attention to the sound sign of gross and of subtle sounds.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000820">
  <sup class="footnotemark">2</sup>
</a> </p>
<p><a name="XIII.5" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.5" ><b class="bfseries">§5.</b></a></a>  These sounds are evident even to his normal consciousness; but they are especially evident to his preliminary-work-concentration consciousness. <a class="footnote" href="#a0000000821">
  <sup class="footnotemark">3</sup>
</a> As he gives his attention to the sound sign in this way, [thinking] “Now the divine ear element will arise,” mind-door adverting arises making one of these sounds its object. When that has ceased, then either four or five impulsions impel, the first three, or four, of which are of the sense sphere and are called preliminary-work, access, conformity, and change-of-lineage, while the fourth, or the fifth, is fine-material-sphere absorption consciousness belonging to the fourth jhāna. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.6" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.6" ><b class="bfseries">§6.</b></a></a>  Herein, it is knowledge arisen together with the absorption consciousness that is called the divine ear element. After that [absorption has been reached, the divine ear element] becomes merged in that ear [of knowledge]. <a class="footnote" href="#a0000000822">
  <sup class="footnotemark">4</sup>
</a> When consolidating it, he should extend it by delimiting a single finger-breadth thus, “I will hear sounds within this area,” then two finger-breadths, four finger-breadths, eight finger-breadths, a span, a<em> ratana</em> (= 24 finger-breadths), the interior <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{460|402}</small></span>of the room, the veranda, the building, the surrounding walk, the park belonging to the community, the alms-resort village, the district, and so on up to the [limit of the] world-sphere, or even more. This is how he should extend it by delimited stages. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.7" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.7" ><b class="bfseries">§7.</b></a></a>  One who has reached direct-knowledge in this way hears also by means of direct-knowledge without re-entering the basic jhāna any sound that has come within the space touched by the basic jhāna’s object. And in hearing in this way, even if there is an uproar with sounds of conches, drums, cymbals, etc., right up to the Brahmā-world <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[409]</i></span> he can, if he wants to, still define each one thus, “This is the sound of conches, this is the sound of drums.” </p>
<p>The explanation of the divine ear element is ended. </p>
<h1 id="a0000000260">2 (3) Penetration of Minds</h1>
<p><a name="XIII.8" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.8" ><b class="bfseries">§8.</b></a></a>  As to the explanation of knowledge of penetration of minds, [the text is as follows: “He directs, he inclines, his mind to the knowledge of penetration of minds. He penetrates with his mind the minds of other beings, of other persons, and understands them thus: he understands [the manner of] consciousness affected by greed as affected by greed, and understands [the manner of] consciousness unaffected by greed as unaffected by greed; he understands consciousness affected by hate as affected by hate, and consciousness unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate; he understands consciousness affected by delusion as affected by delusion, and consciousness unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion; he understands cramped consciousness as cramped, and distracted consciousness as distracted; he understands exalted consciousness as exalted, and unexalted consciousness as unexalted; he understands surpassed consciousness as surpassed and unsurpassed consciousness as unsurpassed; he understands concentrated consciousness as concentrated and unconcentrated consciousness as unconcentrated; he understands the liberated [manner of] consciousness as liberated, and the unliberated [manner of] consciousness as unliberated” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#D" >D</a>
	]
</span>I 79</b>). Here, it goes all round (<em>pariyāti</em>), thus it is penetration (<em>pariya</em>); the meaning is that it delimits (<em>paricchindati</em>). The penetration of the heart (<em>cetaso pariyaṃ</em>) is “penetration of minds” (<em>cetopariya</em>). It is penetration of hearts and that is knowledge, thus it is knowledge of penetration of minds (<em>cetopariyañāṇa</em>). [He directs his consciousness] to that, is what is meant. </p>
<p><em>Of other beings</em>: of the rest of beings, himself excluded. <em>Of other persons</em>: this has the same meaning as the last, the wording being varied to suit those susceptible of teaching [in another way], and for the sake of elegance of exposition. <em>With his mind the minds</em>: with his [manner of] consciousness the [manner of] consciousness of other beings. <em>Having penetrated</em> (<em>paricca</em>): having delimited all round. <em>He understands</em>: he understands them to be of various sorts beginning with that affected by greed. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.9" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.9" ><b class="bfseries">§9.</b></a></a>  But how is this knowledge to be aroused? That is successfully done through the divine eye, which constitutes its preliminary work. Therefore the bhikkhu should extend light, and he should seek out (<em>pariyesitabba</em>) another’s [manner of] consciousness by keeping under observation with the divine eye the colour <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{461|403}</small></span>of the blood present with the matter of the physical heart as its support.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000823">
  <sup class="footnotemark">5</sup>
</a> For when [a manner of] consciousness accompanied by joy is present, the blood is red like a banyan-fig fruit; when [a manner of] consciousness accompanied by grief is present, it is blackish like a rose-apple fruit; when [a manner of] consciousness accompanied by serenity is present, it is clear like sesame oil. So he should seek out another’s [manner of] consciousness by keeping under observation the colour of the blood in the physical heart thus, “This matter is originated by the joy faculty; this is originated by the grief faculty; this is originated by the equanimity faculty,” and so consolidate his knowledge of penetration of hearts. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.10" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.10" ><b class="bfseries">§10.</b></a></a>  It is when it has been consolidated in this way that he can gradually get to understand not only all manner of sense-sphere consciousness but those of fine-material and immaterial consciousness as well by tracing one [manner of] consciousness from another without any more seeing the physical heart’s matter. For this is said in the Commentary: “When he wants to know another’s [manner of] consciousness in the immaterial modes, whose physical-heart matter can he observe? Whose material alteration [originated] by the faculties can he look at? No one’s. The province of a possessor of supernormal power is [simply] this, namely, wherever the [manner of] consciousness he adverts to is, there he knows it according to these sixteen classes.” But this explanation [by means of the physical heart] is for one who has not [yet] done any interpreting.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000824">
  <sup class="footnotemark">6</sup>
</a> </p>
<p><a name="XIII.11" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.11" ><b class="bfseries">§11.</b></a></a>  As regards [<em>the manner of] consciousness affected by greed</em>, etc., the eight [manners of] consciousness accompanied by greed (see Table III, nos. (22)–(29)) <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[410]</i></span> should be understood as [<em>the manner of</em>] consciousness affected by greed. The remaining profitable and indeterminate [manners of] consciousness in the four planes are <em>unaffected by greed</em>. The four, namely, the two consciousnesses accompanied by grief (nos. (30) and (31)), and the two consciousnesses [accompanied respectively by] uncertainty (32) and agitation (33) are not included in this dyad, though some elders include them too. It is the two consciousnesses accompanied by grief that are called <em>consciousness affected by hate</em>. And all profitable and indeterminate consciousnesses in the four planes are unaffected by hate. The remaining ten kinds of unprofitable consciousnesses (nos. (22)–(29) and (32) and (33)) are not included in this dyad, though some elders include them too. <em>Affected by delusion … unaffected by delusion</em>: here only the two, namely, that accompanied by uncertainty and that accompanied by agitation, are affected by delusion alone [without being accompanied by the other two unprofitable roots]. But [all] the twelve kinds of unprofitable consciousnesses (nos. (22)–(33)) can also be understood as [the manner of] <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{462|404}</small></span>consciousness affected by delusion since delusion is present in all kinds of unprofitable consciousnesses. The rest are <em>unaffected by delusion</em>. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.12" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.12" ><b class="bfseries">§12.</b></a></a>  <em>Cramped</em> is that attended by stiffness and torpor. Distracted is that attended by agitation. <em>Exalted</em> is that of the fine-material and immaterial spheres. <em>Unexalted </em>is the rest. <em>Surpassed</em> is all that in the three [mundane] planes. <em>Unsurpassed</em> is the supramundane. <em>Concentrated</em> is that attained to access and that attained to absorption. <em>Unconcentrated</em> is that not attained to either. <em>Liberated</em> is that attained to any [of the five kinds of] deliverance, that is to say, deliverance by substitution of opposites [through insight], by suppression [through concentration], by cutting off [by means of the path], by tranquillization [by means of fruition], and by renunciation [as Nibbāna] (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Paṭis" >Paṭis</a>
	]
</span>I 26</b> under “abandoning”). <em>Unliberated </em>is that which has not attained to any of the five kinds of liberation. </p>
<p>So the bhikkhu who has acquired the knowledge of penetration of hearts understands all these [manners of consciousness, namely, the manner of] consciousness affected by greed as affected by greed … [the unliberated manner of] consciousness as unliberated. </p>
<h1 id="a0000000261">3 (4) Recollection of Past Lives</h1>
<p><a name="XIII.13" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.13" ><b class="bfseries">§13.</b></a></a>  As to the explanation of knowledge of recollection of past lives, [the text is as follows:] He directs, he inclines, his mind to the knowledge of recollection of past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives, that is to say, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world contraction, many eons of world expansion: many eons of world contraction and expansion: “There I was so named, of such a race, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life span; and passing away from there, I reappeared elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of such a race, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life span; and passing away from there, I reappeared here.” Thus with its aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#D" >D</a>
	]
</span>I 81</b>). [Herein,] to <em>the knowledge of recollection of past lives</em> [means] for knowledge concerning recollection of past lives. <em>Past lives</em> is aggregates lived in the past in former births. “Lived” [in that case means] lived out, undergone, arisen and ceased in one’s own [subjective] continuity. Or alternatively, [past lives] is mental objects lived [in the past in one’s former births]; and “lived” in that case means lived by living in one’s [objective] resort, which has been cognized and delimited by one’s own consciousness, or cognized by another’s consciousness, too. In the case of recollection of those [past Enlightened Ones] who have broken the cycle, and so on,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000825">
  <sup class="footnotemark">7</sup>
</a> these last are only accessible to Enlightened Ones. <em>Recollection of past lives</em>: the mindfulness (memory) by means of which he recollects the past lives is the recollection of past lives. Knowledge is the knowledge associated with that mindfulness. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[411]</i></span> <em>To the knowledge of recollection of past lives</em>: for the purpose of <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{463|405}</small></span>the knowledge of the recollection of past lives in this way; for the attaining, for the reaching, of that knowledge, is what is meant. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.14" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.14" ><b class="bfseries">§14.</b></a></a>  <em>Manifold</em>: of many kinds: or that has occurred in many ways. Given in detail, is the meaning.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000826">
  <sup class="footnotemark">8</sup>
</a> <em>Past lives </em>is the continuity lived here and there, taking the immediately previous existence as the beginning [and working backwards]. <em>He recollects</em>: he recalls it, following it out by the succession of aggregates, or by death and rebirth-linking. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.15" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.15" ><b class="bfseries">§15.</b></a></a>  There are six kinds of people who recollect these past lives. They are: other sectarians, ordinary disciples, great disciples, chief disciples, Paccekabuddhas, and Buddhas. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.16" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  Herein, other sectarians recollect only as far back as forty eons, but not beyond that. Why? Because their understanding is weak for lack of delimitation of mind and matter (see <a href="ch-25.html#XVIII" >Ch. XVIII</a>). Ordinary disciples recollect as far back as a hundred eons and as far back as a thousand eons because their understanding is strong. The eighty great disciples recollect as far back as a hundred thousand eons. The two chief disciples recollect as far back as an incalculable age and a hundred thousand eons. Paccekabuddhas recollect as far back as two incalculable ages and a hundred thousand eons. For such is the extent to which they can convey [their minds back respectively]. But there is no limit in the case of Buddhas. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.17" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.17" ><b class="bfseries">§17.</b></a></a>  Again, other sectarians only recollect the succession of aggregates; they are unable to recollect according [only] to death and rebirth-linking, letting go of the succession of aggregates. They are like the blind in that they are unable to descend upon any place they choose; they go as the blind do without letting go of their sticks. So they recollect without letting go of the succession of aggregates. Ordinary disciples both recollect by means of the succession of aggregates and trace by means of death and rebirth-linking. Likewise, the eighty great disciples. But the chief disciples have nothing to do with the succession of aggregates. When they see the death of one person, they see the rebirth-linking, and again when they see the death of another, they see the rebirth-linking. So they go by tracing through death and rebirth-thinking. Likewise, Paccekabuddhas. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.18" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.18" ><b class="bfseries">§18.</b></a></a>  Buddhas, however, have nothing to do either with succession of aggregates or with tracing through death and rebirth-linking; for whatever instance they choose in many millions of eons, or more or less, is evident to them. So they go, and so they descend with the lion’s descent<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000827">
  <sup class="footnotemark">9</sup>
</a> wherever they want, even skipping over many millions of eons as though they were an elision in a text. And just as an arrow shot by such a master of archery expert in hair-splitting as Sarabhaṅga (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#J-a" >J-a</a>
	]
</span>V 129</b>) always hits the target without getting held up among trees, creepers, etc., on its way, and so neither gets held up nor misses, so too, since Buddhas go in this way their knowledge does not get held up in intermediate <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{464|406}</small></span>births <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[412]</i></span> or miss; without getting held up or missing, it seizes any instance required. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.19" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.19" ><b class="bfseries">§19.</b></a></a>  Among these beings with recollection of past lives, the sectarians’ vision of past lives seems like the light of a glow-worm, that of ordinary disciples like the light of a candle, that of the great disciples like the light of a torch, that of the chief disciples like the light of the morning star, that of Paccekabuddhas like the light of the moon, and that of Buddhas like the glorious autumn sun’s disk with its thousand rays. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.20" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.20" ><b class="bfseries">§20.</b></a></a>  Other sectarians see past lives as blind men go [tapping] with the point of a stick. Ordinary disciples do so as men who go on a log bridge. The great disciples do so as men who go on a foot bridge. The chief disciples do so as men who go on a cart bridge. Paccekabuddhas do so as men who go on a main foot-path. And Buddhas do so as men who go on a high road for carts. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.21" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.21" ><b class="bfseries">§21.</b></a></a>  In this connection it is the disciples’ recollection of past lives that is intended. Hence it was said above: “‘He recollects’: he recollects it following it out by the succession of aggregates, or by death and rebirth-linking” (<a href="ch-19.html#XIII.14" >§14</a>). </p>
<p><a name="XIII.22" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.22" ><b class="bfseries">§22.</b></a></a>  So a bhikkhu who is a beginner and wants to recollect in this way should go into solitary retreat on return from his alms round after his meal. Then he should attain the four jhānas in succession and emerge from the fourth jhāna as basis for direct-knowledge. He should then advert to his most recent act of sitting down [for this purpose], next, to the preparation of the seat, to the entry into the lodging, to the putting away of the bowl and [outer] robe, to the time of eating, to the time of returning from the village, to the time of wandering for alms in the village, to the time of entering the village, to the time of setting out from the monastery, to the time of paying homage at the shrine terrace and the Enlightenment-tree terrace, to the time of washing the bowl, to the time of picking up the bowl, to the things done from the time of picking up the bowl back to the mouth washing, to the things done in the early morning, to the things done in the middle watch, in the first watch. In this way he should advert to all the things done during the whole night and day in reverse order. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.23" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.23" ><b class="bfseries">§23.</b></a></a>  While this much, however, is evident even to his normal consciousness, it is especially evident to his preliminary-work consciousness. But if anything there is not evident, he should again attain the basic jhāna, emerge and advert. By so doing it becomes as evident as when a lamp is lit. And so, in reverse order too, he should advert to the things done on the second day back, and on the third, fourth and fifth day, and in the ten days, and in the fortnight, and as far back as a year. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.24" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.24" ><b class="bfseries">§24.</b></a></a>  When by these means he adverts to ten years, twenty years, and so on as far back as his own rebirth-linking in this existence, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[413]</i></span> he should advert to the mentality-materiality occurring at the moment of death in the preceding existence; for a wise bhikkhu is able at the first attempt to remove<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000828">
  <sup class="footnotemark">10</sup>
</a> the rebirth-linking and make the mentality-materiality at the death moment his object. </p>

The first of these, called “preliminary-work,” etc., in the way already described (<a href="ch-19.html#XIII.5" >§5</a>), are of the sense sphere. The last is a fine-material absorption consciousness of the fourth jhāna.

Also there are three limits to the contraction; the Ābhassara (Streaming-radiance) Brahmā-world, that of the Subhakiṇha (Refulgent-glory), and that of the Vehapphala (Great-fruit). When the aeon contracts owing to fire, all below the Ābhassara [Brahmā-world] is burnt up by fire. When it contracts owing to water, it is all dissolved by water up to the Subhakiṇha [Brahmā-world].

On the occasion when the aeon is destroyed by fire <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[415]</i></span> first of all a great cloud heralding the aeon’s destruction appears, and there is a great downpour all over the hundred thousand million world-spheres.

Rain is withheld from then on.

Some say that the denizens of hell perish there with the appearance of the seventh sun (<a href="ch-19.html#XIII.41" >§41</a>). </p>
<p>Now, there is no rebirth in the Brahmā-world without jhāna; and some of them, being obsessed with the scarcity of food, are unable to attain jhāna, so how are they reborn there? By means of jhāna obtained in the [sense-sphere] divine world. </p>

They make this announcement: “Good sirs, good sirs, at the end of a hundred thousand years from now there will be the emergence of an aeon. This world will be destroyed. Even the ocean will dry up. This great earth, and the Sineru King of Mountains, will be consumed and destroyed. The destruction of the earth will extend as far as the Brahmā-world. Develop loving-kindness, good sirs, develop compassion, gladness, equanimity, good sirs. Care for your mothers, care for your fathers, honour the elders of your clans.” </p>

They become kind to each other and make merit with loving-kindness, etc., and so they are reborn in the divine world. There they eat divine food, and they do the preliminary work on the air kasiṇa and acquire jhāna. Others, however, are reborn in a [sense-sphere] divine world through kamma to be experienced in a future life. For there is no being traversing the round of rebirths who is destitute of kamma to be experienced in a future life. They too acquire jhāna there in the same way. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[416]</i></span> All are eventually reborn in the Brahmā-world by acquiring jhāna in a [sense-sphere] divine world in this way. </p>

When it has burnt up all the golden palaces, the jewelled palaces and the crystal palaces there, it invades the Realm of the Thirty-three. And so it goes right on up to the plane of the first jhāna.

And so it pours down upon all burnt areas in the hundred thousand million world-spheres till they disappear. Then the winds (forces) beneath and all around that water rise up and compact it and round it, like water drops on a lotus leaf. How do they compact the great mass of water?

<p><a name="XIII.73" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.73" ><b class="bfseries">§73.</b></a></a>  But as regards <em>with the divine eye</em>, etc., it is <em>divine</em> because of its similarity to the divine; for deities have as divine eye the sensitivity that is produced by kamma consisting in good conduct and is unimpeded by bile, phlegm, blood, etc., and capable of receiving an object even though far off because it is liberated from imperfections. And this eye, consisting in knowledge, which is produced by the power of this bhikkhu’s energy in development, is similar to that, so it is “divine” because it is similar to the divine. Also it is “divine” because it is obtained by means of divine abiding, and because it has divine abiding as its support. And it is “divine” because it greatly illuminates by discerning light. And it is “divine” because it has a great range through seeing visible objects that are behind walls, and so on. All that should be understood according to the science of grammar. It is an <em>eye</em> in the sense of seeing. Also it is an eye since it is like an eye in its performance of an eye’s function. It is <em>purified</em> since it is a cause of purification of view, owing to seeing passing away and reappearance. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.74" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.74" ><b class="bfseries">§74.</b></a></a>  One who sees only passing away and not reappearance assumes the annihilation view; and one who sees only reappearance and not passing away assumes the view that a new being appears. But since one who sees both outstrips that twofold [false] view, that vision of his is therefore a cause for purification of view. And the Buddhas’ sons see both of these. Hence it was said above: <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[424]</i></span> “It is ‘purified’ since it is a cause of purification of view, owing to seeing passing away and reappearance.” </p>

That vision also is only the divine eye’s function. He gives attention to it in this way, “After doing what deeds do these beings enjoy this good fortune?” Then knowledge that has those deeds as its object arises in him in this way, “It was after doing this.” This is what is called knowledge of faring according to deeds. </p>

An elder and a young bhikkhu, it seems, wandered for alms in a certain village. At the first house they got only a spoonful of hot gruel. The elder’s stomach was paining him with wind. He thought, “This gruel is good for me; I shall drink it before it gets cold.” People brought a wooden stool to the doorstep, and he sat down and drank it. The other was disgusted and remarked, “The old man has let his hunger get the better of him and has done what he should be ashamed to do.” The elder wandered for alms, and on returning to the monastery he asked the young bhikkhu, “Have you any footing in this Dispensation, friend?”—“Yes, venerable sir, I am a stream-enterer.”—“Then, friend, do not try for the higher paths; one whose cankers are destroyed has been reviled by you.” The young bhikkhu asked for the elder’s forgiveness and was thereby restored to his former state. </p>

When I remember it, I am remorseful. What shall I do?” He should be told, “Think no more about it; the elder forgives you. Set your mind at rest.” Then he should extend his hands palms together in the direction taken by the Noble One and say, “Forgive me.” </p>
<p><a name="XIII.88" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.88" ><b class="bfseries">§88.</b></a></a>  If the Noble One has attained the final Nibbāna, he should go to the place where the bed is, on which he attained the final Nibbāna, and should go as far as the charnel ground to ask forgiveness.

Someone set out on a journey by night, it seems, with a grass torch. His torch stopped flaming. Then the even and uneven places were no more evident to him. He stubbed the torch on the ground and it again blazed up. In doing so it gave more light than before. As it went on dying out and flaring up again, eventually the sun rose. When the sun had risen, he thought, “There is no further need of the torch,” and he threw it away and went on by daylight. </p>

His no more seeing what is visible when the light has disappeared owing to the turn of the preliminary work running out while he is seeing what is visible is like the man’s not seeing the even and uneven places owing to the torch’s stopping flaming. His repeated attaining is like the stubbing of the torch. His more powerful pervasion with light by repeating the preliminary work is like the torch’s giving more light than before. The strong light’s <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{479|421}</small></span>remaining in as large an area as he delimits is like the sun’s rising. His seeing even during a whole day what is visible in the strong light after throwing the limited light away is like the man’s going on by day after throwing the torch away. </p>

Because wherever he determines, “Let there be light,” it becomes all light, even after penetrating through earth, sea and mountains. Then fear arises in him when he sees the fearful forms of spirits, ogres, etc., that are there, owing to which his mind is distracted and he loses his jhāna.

When the Elder Mahā Kassapa was making the great relic store, it seems, he resolved thus, “During the next two hundred and eighteen years in the future let not these perfumes dry up or these flowers wither or these lamps go out,” and so it all happened. When the Elder Assagutta saw the Community of Bhikkhus eating dry food in the Vattaniya Lodging he resolved thus, “Let the water pool become cream of curd every day before the meal,” and when the water was taken before the meal it was cream of curd; but after the meal there was only the normal water.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000840">

<p>At the time of knowing others’ sense-sphere consciousness it <em>has a limited object</em>. At the time of knowing their fine-material-sphere or immaterial-sphere consciousness it <em>has an exalted object</em>. At the time of knowing path and fruition it has a measureless object. And here an ordinary man does not know a stream-enterer’s consciousness, nor does a stream-enterer know a once-returner’s, and so up to the Arahant’s consciousness. But an Arahant knows the consciousness of all the others. And each higher one knows the consciousnesses of all those below him. This is the difference to be understood. At the time when it has path consciousness as its object it <em>has path as object</em>. But when one knows another’s consciousness within the past seven days, or within the future seven days, then it <em>has a past object</em> and <em>has a future object</em> respectively. </p>

What is included in one or two rounds of continuity is <em>present by continuity</em>. </p>

And when he goes into an inner closet after going about in a well-lit place, a visible object is not immediately evident at first; until it becomes clear, one or two rounds of continuity should be understood [to pass] meanwhile. When he stands at a distance, although he sees the alterations (movements) of the hands of washer-men and the alterations (movements) of the striking of gongs, drums, etc., yet he does not hear the sound at first (see <a href="ch-21.html#XIV.n22" >Ch.

<p><a name="XIII.113" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.113" ><b class="bfseries">§113.</b></a></a>  The Saṃyutta reciters, however, say that there are two kinds of continuity, that is to say, material continuity and immaterial continuity: that a material continuity lasts as long as the [muddy] line of water touching the bank when one treads in the water takes to clear,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000842">
  <sup class="footnotemark">24</sup>

Both of these are [according to them] called “present by continuity.” <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[432]</i></span> </p>
<p><a name="XIII.114" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.114" ><b class="bfseries">§114.</b></a></a>  What is delimited by a single becoming (existence) is called <em>present by extent</em>, with reference to which it is said in the Bhaddekaratta Sutta: “Friends, the mind and mental objects are both what is present.

When he delights in that, then he is vanquished with respect to present states” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p>And here, “present by continuity” is used in the Commentaries while “present </p>
<p><a name="XIII.115" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.115" ><b class="bfseries">§115.</b></a></a>  by extent” is used in the Suttas. Herein, some<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000843">
  <sup class="footnotemark">25</sup>
</a> say that consciousness “present by moment” is the object of knowledge of penetration of minds. What reason do they give? It is that the consciousness of the possessor of supernormal power and that of the other arise in a single moment. Their simile is this: just as when a handful of flowers is thrown into the air, the stalk of one flower is probably struck by the stalk of another, and so too, when with the thought, “I will know another’s mind,” the mind of a multitude is adverted to as a mass, then the mind of one is probably penetrated by the mind of the other either at the moment of arising or at the moment of presence or at the moment of dissolution. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.116" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.116" ><b class="bfseries">§116.</b></a></a>  That, however, is rejected in the Commentaries as erroneous, because even if one went on adverting for a hundred or a thousand years, there is never co-presence of the two consciousnesses, that is to say, of that with which he adverts <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{483|425}</small></span>and that [of impulsion] with which he knows, and because the flaw of plurality of objects follows if presence [of the same object] to both adverting and impulsion is not insisted on. What should be understood is that the object is present by continuity and present by extent. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.117" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.117" ><b class="bfseries">§117.</b></a></a>  Herein, another’s consciousness during a time measuring two or three cognitive series with impulsions extending before and after the [strictly] currently existing cognitive series with impulsions, is all called “present by continuity.” But in the Saṃyutta Commentary it is said that “present by extent” should be illustrated by a round of impulsions. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.118" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.118" ><b class="bfseries">§118.</b></a></a>  That is rightly said. Here is the illustration. The possessor of supernormal-power who wants to know another’s mind adverts. The adverting [consciousness] makes [the other’s consciousness that is] present by moment its object and ceases together with it. After that there are four or five impulsions, of which the last is the supernormal-power consciousness, the rest being of the sense sphere. That same [other’s] consciousness, which has ceased, is the object of all these too, and so they do not have different objects because they have an object that is “present by extent.” And while they have a single object it is only the supernormal-power consciousness that actually knows another’s consciousness, not the others, just as in the eye-door it is only eye-consciousness that actually sees the visible datum, not the others. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.119" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.119" ><b class="bfseries">§119.</b></a></a>  So this has a present object in what is present by continuity and what is present by extent. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[433]</i></span> Or since what is present by continuity falls within what is present by extent, it can therefore be understood that it has a present object simply in what is present by extent. </p>
<p>It <em>has an external object</em> because it has only another’s mind as its object. </p>
<p>This is how knowledge of penetration of minds should be understood to occur with respect to the eight kinds of objects. </p>
<p><a name="XIII.120" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.120" ><b class="bfseries">§120.</b></a></a>  (4) <em>Knowledge of past lives</em> occurs with respect to eight kinds of object, that is to say, as having a limited, exalted, or measureless object, path as object, a past object, and an internal, external, or not-so-classifiable object. How? </p>
<p>At the time of recollecting sense-sphere aggregates it <em>has a limited object</em>.

At the time of recollecting a path developed, or a fruition realized, in the past either by oneself or by others, it <em>has a measureless object</em>.

<p><a name="XIII.121" ><a href="ch-19.html#XIII.121" ><b class="bfseries">§121.</b></a></a>  Herein, although knowledge of penetration of minds and knowledge of faring according to deeds also have a past object, still, of these two, the object of the knowledge of penetration of minds is only consciousness within the past seven days. It knows neither other aggregates nor what is bound up with aggregates [that is, name, surname, and so on]. It is said indirectly that it has a path as object since it has the consciousness associated with the path as its object. Also, the object of knowledge of faring according to deeds is simply past volition. But there is nothing, whether past aggregates or what is bound up <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{484|426}</small></span>with aggregates, that is not the object of knowledge of past lives; for that is on a par with omniscient knowledge with respect to past aggregates and states bound up with aggregates.
