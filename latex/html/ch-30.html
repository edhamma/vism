<h1 id="a0000000406">1 (vi) What are the benefits in developing understanding?</h1>
<p><a name="XXIII.1" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.1" ><b class="bfseries">§1.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{788|730}</small></span>(vi) <span class="scshape">What are the benefits in developing understanding?</span> (See <a href="ch-21.html#XIV.1" >XIV.1</a>)<b class="bfseries"> </b><span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[698]</i></span> </p>
<p>To that question, which was asked above, we reply that this development of understanding has many hundred benefits. But it would be impossible to explain its benefits in detail, however long a time were taken over it. Briefly, though, its benefits should be understood as these: (A) removal of the various defilements, (B) experience of the taste of the noble fruit, (C) ability to attain the attainment of cessation, and (D) achievement of worthiness to receive gifts and so on. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000407">1.1 A. Removal of the Defilements</h2>
<p><a name="XXIII.2" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.2" ><b class="bfseries">§2.</b></a></a>  Herein, it should be understood that one of the benefits of the mundane development of understanding is the removal of the various defilements beginning with [mistaken] view of individuality. This starts with the delimitation of mentality-materiality. Then one of the benefits of the supramundane development of understanding is the removal, at the path moment, of the various defilements beginning with the fetters. </p>

<h2 id="a0000000408">1.2 B. The Taste of the Noble Fruit</h2>
<p><a name="XXIII.3" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.3" ><b class="bfseries">§3.</b></a></a>  Not only the removal of the various defilements but also the experience of the taste of the noble fruit is a benefit of the development of understanding. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[699]</i></span> For it is the fruitions of stream-entry, etc.—the fruits of asceticism—that are called <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{789|731}</small></span>the “noble fruit.” Its taste is experienced in two ways, that is to say, in its occurrence in the cognitive series of the path, and in its occurrence in the attainment of fruition. Of these, only its occurrence in the cognitive series of the path has been shown (<a href="ch-29.html#XXII.3" >XXII.3f.</a>). </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.4" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  Furthermore, when people say that the fruit is the mere abandoning of fetters<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001141">
  <sup class="footnotemark">1</sup>
</a> and nothing more than that, the following sutta can be cited in order to convince them that they are wrong: “How is it that understanding of the tranquilizing of effort is knowledge of fruit? At the moment of the stream-entry path right view in the sense of seeing emerges from wrong view, and it emerges from the defilements and from the aggregates that occur consequent upon that [wrong view], and externally it emerges from all signs. Right view arises because of the tranquilizing of that effort. This is the fruit of the path” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XXIII.5" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.5" ><b class="bfseries">§5.</b></a></a>  However, in order to show how it occurs in the attainment of fruition there is the following set of questions: </p>
<p>(i) What is fruition attainment? (ii) Who attains it? (iii) Who do not attain it? (iv) Why do they attain it? (v) How does its attainment come about? (vi) How is it made to last? (vii) How does the emergence from it come about? (viii) What is next to fruition? (ix) What is fruition next to? </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.6" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.6" ><b class="bfseries">§6.</b></a></a>  Herein, (i) <em>What is fruition attainment</em>? It is absorption in the cessation in which the noble fruition consists. </p>
<p>(ii) <em>Who attains it?</em> (iii) <em>Who do not attain it</em>? No ordinary men attain it. Why? Because it is beyond their reach. But all Noble Ones attain it. Why? Because it is within their reach. But those who have reached a higher path do not attain a lower fruition because the state of each successive person is more tranquilized than the one below. And those who have only reached a lower path do not attain a higher fruition because it is beyond their reach. But each one attains his appropriate fruition. This is what has been agreed here. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.7" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.7" ><b class="bfseries">§7.</b></a></a>  But there are some who say that the stream-enterer and once-returner do not attain it, and that only the two above them attain it. The reason they give is that <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{790|732}</small></span>only these two show achievement in concentration. But that is no reason, since even the ordinary man attains such mundane concentration as is within his reach. But why argue here over what is and what is not a reason? Is it not said in the texts as follows? </p>
<p>“Which ten states of change-of-lineage arise <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[700]</i></span> through insight? </p>
<p>“For the purpose of obtaining the stream-entry path it overcomes arising, occurrence … (etc., see <a href="ch-29.html#XXII.5" >XXII.5</a>) … despair, and externally the sign of formations, thus it is change-of-lineage. </p>
<p>“For the purpose of attaining the stream-entry fruition … </p>
<p>“For the purpose of attaining the once-return path … </p>
<p>“For the purpose of attaining the once-return fruition … </p>
<p>“For the purpose of attaining the non-return path … </p>
<p>“For the purpose of attaining the non-return fruition … </p>
<p>“For the purpose of attaining the Arahant path … </p>
<p>“For the purpose of attaining the Arahant fruition … </p>
<p>“For the purpose of attaining the void abiding … </p>
<p>“For the purpose of attaining the signless abiding it overcomes arising, occurrence … (etc.) … despair, and externally the sign of formations, thus it is change-of-lineage” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	]
</span>I 68</b>).<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001142">
  <sup class="footnotemark">2</sup>
</a> From that it must be concluded that all Noble Ones attain each their own fruit. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.8" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.8" ><b class="bfseries">§8.</b></a></a>  (iv) <em>Why do they attain it</em>? For the purpose of abiding in bliss here and now. For just as a king experiences royal bliss and a deity experiences divine bliss, so too the Noble Ones think, “We shall experience the noble supramundane bliss,” and after deciding on the duration, they attain the attainment of fruition whenever they choose.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001143">

</a> </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.9" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.9" ><b class="bfseries">§9.</b></a></a>  (v) <em>How does its attainment come about</em>? (vi) <em>How is it made to last</em>? (vii) <em>How does the emergence from it come about</em>? </p>
<p>(v) In the first place its attainment comes about for two reasons: with not bringing to mind any object other than Nibbāna, and with bringing Nibbāna to mind, according as it is said: “Friend, there are two conditions for the attainment of the signless mind-deliverance; they are the non-bringing to mind of all signs, and the bringing to mind of the signless element” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>I 296</b>). </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.10" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.10" ><b class="bfseries">§10.</b></a></a>  Now, the process of attaining it is as follows. A noble disciple who seeks the attainment of fruition should go into solitary retreat. He should see formations with insight according to rise and fall and so on. When that insight has progressed [as far as conformity], then comes change-of-lineage knowledge <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{791|733}</small></span>with formations as its object.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001144">
  <sup class="footnotemark">4</sup>
</a> And immediately next to it consciousness becomes absorbed in cessation with the attainment of fruition. And here it is only fruition, not path, that arises even in a trainer, because his tendency is to fruition attainment. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.11" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.11" ><b class="bfseries">§11.</b></a></a>  But there are those<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001145">
  <sup class="footnotemark">5</sup>
</a> who say that when a stream-enterer embarks on insight, thinking, “I shall attain fruition attainment,” he becomes a once-returner, and a once-returner, a non-returner. They should be told: “In that case a non-returner becomes an Arahant and an Arahant, a Paccekabuddha and a Paccekabuddha, a Buddha. For that reason, and because it is contradicted as well by the text quoted above, none of that should be accepted. Only this should be accepted: fruition itself, not path, arises also in the trainer. And if the path he has arrived at had the first jhāna, his fruition will have the first jhāna too when it arises. If the path has the second, so will the fruition. And so with the other jhānas.” </p>
<p>This, firstly, is how attaining comes about. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[701]</i></span> </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.12" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.12" ><b class="bfseries">§12.</b></a></a>  (vi) It is made to last in three ways, because of the words: “Friend, there are three conditions for the persistence of the signless mind-deliverance: they are the non-bringing to mind of all signs, the bringing to mind of the signless element, and the <em>prior volition</em>” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#M" >M</a>
	]
</span>I 296–297</b>). Herein, the prior volition is the predetermining of the time before attaining;<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001146">
  <sup class="footnotemark">6</sup>
</a> for it is by determining it thus, “I shall emerge at such a time,” that it lasts until that time comes. This is how it is made to last. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.13" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.13" ><b class="bfseries">§13.</b></a></a>  (vii) Emergence from it comes about in two ways, because of the words: “Friend, there are two conditions for the emergence from the signless mind-deliverance: they are the bringing to mind of all signs, and the non-bringing to mind of the signless element” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#M" >M</a>
	]
</span>I 297</b>). Herein, of all signs means the sign of materiality, sign of feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. Of course, a man does not bring all those to mind at once, but this is said in order to include all. So the emergence from the attainment of fruition comes about in him when he brings to mind whatever is the object of the life-continuum.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001147">

In the first case (viii) either fruition itself is next to fruition or the life-continuum is next to it. But (ix) there is fruition that is (a) next to the path, (b) there is that next to fruition, (c) there is that next to change-of-lineage, and (d) there is that next to the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception. <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{792|734}</small></span>Herein, (a) it is <em>next to the path</em> in the cognitive series of the path. (b) Each one that is subsequent to a previous one is <em>next to fruition</em>. (c) Each first one in the attainments of fruition is <em>next to change-of-lineage</em>. And conformity should be understood here as “change-of-lineage”; for this is said in the Paṭṭhāna: “In the Arahant, conformity is a condition, as proximity condition, for fruition attainment. In trainers, conformity is a condition, as proximity condition, for fruition attainment” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

But in a non-returner the mastery is owing to fourteen kinds of exercise of knowledge. If that is so, then does it not come about also in the once-returner owing to twelve? And in the stream-enterer owing to ten?—It does not. Because the greed based on the cords of sense desire, which is an obstacle to concentration, is unabandoned in them. It is because that is not abandoned in them that the serenity power is not perfected. Since it is not perfected they are not, owing to want of power, able to attain the attainment of cessation, which has to be attained by the two powers. But it is abandoned in the non-returner and so his power is perfected. Since his power is perfected he is able to attain it. </p>
<p>Hence the Blessed One said: “Profitable [consciousness] of the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception in one emerging from cessation is a condition, as proximity condition, for the attainment of fruition” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

Being wearied by the occurrence and dissolution of formations, they attain it thinking, “Let us dwell in bliss by being without consciousness here and now and reaching the cessation that is Nibbāna.”<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001153">
  <sup class="footnotemark">13</sup>
</a> </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.31" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.31" ><b class="bfseries">§31.</b></a></a>  (vi) <em>How does its attainment come about</em>? It comes about in one who performs the preparatory tasks by striving with serenity and insight and causes the cessation of [consciousness belonging to] the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception. One who strives with serenity alone reaches the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception and remains there, while one who strives with insight alone reaches the attainment of fruition and remains there. But it is one who strives with both, and after performing the preparatory tasks, causes the cessation of [consciousness belonging to] the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception, who attains it. This is in brief. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.32" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.32" ><b class="bfseries">§32.</b></a></a>  But the detail is this. When a bhikkhu who desires to attain cessation has finished all that has to do with his meal and has washed his hands and feet well, he sits down on a well-prepared seat in a secluded place. Having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, established mindfulness in front of him, he attains the first jhāna, and on emerging he sees the formations in it with insight as impermanent, painful, not-self. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.33" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.33" ><b class="bfseries">§33.</b></a></a>  This insight is threefold as insight that discerns formations, insight for the attainment of fruition, and insight for the attainment of cessation. Herein, insight that discerns formations, whether sluggish or keen, is the proximate cause only for a path. Insight for the attainment of fruition, which is only valid when keen, is similar to that for the development of a path. Insight for the attainment of cessation is only valid when it is not over-sluggish and not over-keen. Therefore he sees those formations with insight that is not over-sluggish and not over-keen. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.34" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.34" ><b class="bfseries">§34.</b></a></a>  After that, he attains the second jhāna, and on emerging he sees formations with insight in like manner. After that, he attains the third jhāna … (etc.) … After that, he attains the base consisting of boundless consciousness, and on emerging he sees the formations in it in like manner. Likewise he attains the base consisting <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{797|739}</small></span>of nothingness. On emerging from that he does the fourfold preparatory task, that is to say, about (a) non-damage to others’ property, (b) the Community’s waiting, (c) the Master’s summons, and (d) the limit of the duration. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[706]</i></span> </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.35" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.35" ><b class="bfseries">§35.</b></a></a>  (a) Herein, <em>non-damage to others’ property</em> refers to what the bhikkhu has about him that is not his personal property: a robe and bowl, or a bed and chair, or a living room, or any other kind of requisite kept by him but the property of various others. It should be resolved<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001154">
  <sup class="footnotemark">14</sup>
</a> that such property will not be damaged, will not be destroyed by fire, water, wind, thieves, rats, and so on. Here is the form of the resolve: “During these seven days let this and this not be burnt by fire; let it not be swept off by water; let it not be spoilt by wind; let it not be stolen by thieves; let it not be devoured by rats, and so on.” When he has resolved in this way, they are not in danger during the seven days. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.36" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.36" ><b class="bfseries">§36.</b></a></a>  If he does not resolve in this way, they may be destroyed by fire, etc., as in the case of the Elder Mahā Nāga. The elder, it seems, went for alms into the village where his mother, a lay follower, lived. She gave him rice gruel and seated him in the sitting hall. The elder sat down and attained cessation. While he was sitting there the hall caught fire. The other bhikkhus each picked up their seats and fled. The villagers gathered together, and seeing the elder, they said, “What a lazy monk! What a lazy monk!” The fire burned the grass thatch, the bamboos, and timbers, and it encircled the elder. People brought water and put it out. They removed the ashes, did repairs,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001155">
  <sup class="footnotemark">15</sup>
</a> scattered flowers, and then stood respectfully waiting. The elder emerged at the time he had determined. Seeing them, he said, “I am discovered!,” and he rose up into the air and went to Piyaṅgu Island. This is “non-damage to others’ property.” </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.37" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.37" ><b class="bfseries">§37.</b></a></a>  There is no special resolving to be done for what is his own personal property such as the inner and outer robes or the seat he is sitting on. He protects all that by means of the attainment itself, like those of the venerable Sañjīva. And this is said: “There was success by intervention of concentration in the venerable Sañjīva. There was success by intervention of concentration in the venerable Sāriputta” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XXIII.38" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.38" ><b class="bfseries">§38.</b></a></a>  (b) <em>The Community’s waiting</em> is the Community’s expecting. The meaning is: till this bhikkhu comes there is no carrying out of acts of the Community. And here it is not the actual Community’s waiting that is the preparatory task, but the adverting to the waiting. So it should be adverted to in this way: “While I am sitting for seven days in the attainment of cessation, if the Community wants to enact a resolution, etc., I shall emerge before any bhikkhu comes to summon me.” <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[707]</i></span> One who attains it after doing this emerges at exactly that time. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.39" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.39" ><b class="bfseries">§39.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{798|740}</small></span>But if he does not do so, then perhaps the Community assembles, and not seeing him, it is asked, “Where is the bhikkhu so and so?” They reply, “He has attained cessation.” The Community dispatches a bhikkhu, telling him, “Go and summon him in the name of the Community.” Then as soon as the bhikkhu stands within his hearing and merely says, “The Community is waiting for you, friend,” he emerges. Such is the importance of the Community’s order. So he should attain in such-wise that, by adverting to it beforehand, he emerges by himself. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.40" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.40" ><b class="bfseries">§40.</b></a></a>  (c) <em>The Master’s summons</em>: here too it is the adverting to the Master’s summons that is the preparatory task. So that also should be adverted to in this way: “While I am sitting for seven days in the attainment of cessation, if the Master, after examining a case, makes known a course of training, or teaches the Dhamma, the origin of which discourse is some need that has arisen,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001156">
  <sup class="footnotemark">16</sup>
</a> I shall emerge before anyone comes to summon me.” For when he has seated himself after doing so, he emerges at exactly that time. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.41" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.41" ><b class="bfseries">§41.</b></a></a>  But if he does not do so, when the Community assembles, the Master, not seeing him, asks, “Where is the bhikkhu so and so?” They reply, “He has attained cessation.” Then he dispatches a bhikkhu, telling him, “Go and summon him in my name.” As soon as the bhikkhu stands within his hearing and merely says, “The Master calls the venerable one,” he emerges. Such is the importance of the Master’s summons. So he should attain in such wise that, by adverting to it beforehand, he emerges himself. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.42" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.42" ><b class="bfseries">§42.</b></a></a>  (d) <em>The limit of duration</em> is the limit of life’s duration. For this bhikkhu should be very careful to determine what the limit of his life’s duration is. He should attain only after adverting in this way: “Will my own vital formations go on occurring for seven days or will they not?” For if he attains it without adverting when the vital formations are due to cease within seven days, then since the attainment of cessation cannot ward off his death because there is no dying during cessation,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001157">
  <sup class="footnotemark">17</sup>
</a> he consequently emerges from the attainment meanwhile. So he should attain only after adverting to that. For it is said that while it may be permissible to omit adverting to others, this must be adverted to. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.43" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.43" ><b class="bfseries">§43.</b></a></a>  Now, when he has thus attained the base consisting of nothingness and emerged and done this preparatory task, he then attains the base consisting of <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{799|741}</small></span>neither perception nor non-perception. Then after one or two turns of consciousness have passed, he becomes without consciousness, he achieves cessation. But why do consciousnesses not go on occurring in him after the two consciousnesses? Because the effort is directed to cessation. For this bhikkhu’s mounting through the eight attainments, coupling together the states of serenity and insight, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[708]</i></span> is directed to successive cessation, not to attaining the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception. So it is because the effort is directed to cessation that no more than the two consciousnesses occur. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.44" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.44" ><b class="bfseries">§44.</b></a></a>  But if a bhikkhu emerges from the base consisting of nothingness without having done this preparatory task and then attains the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception, he is unable then to become without consciousness: he returns to the base consisting of nothingness and settles down there. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.45" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.45" ><b class="bfseries">§45.</b></a></a>  And here the simile of the man and the road not previously travelled may be told. A man who had not previously travelled a certain road came to a ravine cut by water, or after crossing a deep morass he came to a rock heated by a fierce sun. Then without arranging his inner and outer garments, he descended into the ravine but came up again for fear of wetting his belongings and remained on the bank, or he walked up on to the rock but on burning his feet he returned to the near side and waited there. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.46" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.46" ><b class="bfseries">§46.</b></a></a>  Herein, just as the man, as soon as he had descended into the ravine, or walked up on to the hot rock, turned back and remained on the near side because he had not seen to the arrangement of his inner and outer garments, so too as soon as the meditator has attained the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception, he turns back and remains in the base consisting of nothingness because the preparatory task has not been done. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.47" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.47" ><b class="bfseries">§47.</b></a></a>  Just as when a man who has travelled that road before comes to that place, he puts his inner garment on securely, and taking the other in his hand, crosses over the ravine, or so acts as to tread only lightly on the hot rock and accordingly gets to the other side, so too, when the bhikkhu does the preparatory task and then attains the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception, then he achieves cessation, which is the other side, by becoming without consciousness. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.48" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.48" ><b class="bfseries">§48.</b></a></a>  (vii) <em>How is it made to last</em>? It lasts as long as the time predetermined for its duration, unless interrupted meanwhile by the exhaustion of the life span, by the waiting of the Community, or by the Master’s summons. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.49" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.49" ><b class="bfseries">§49.</b></a></a>  (viii) <em>How does the emergence from it come about</em>? The emergence comes about in two ways thus: by means of the fruition of non-return in the case of the non-returner, or by means of the fruition of Arahantship in the case of the Arahant. </p>
<p><a name="XXIII.50" ><a href="ch-30.html#XXIII.50" ><b class="bfseries">§50.</b></a></a>  (ix) <em>Towards what does the mind of one who has emerged tend</em>? It tends towards Nibbāna.

This is also given in a sutta, according as it is said: “When a bhikkhu is dead, friend, has completed his term, his bodily formations have ceased and are quite still, his verbal formations have ceased and are quite still, his mental formations have ceased and are quite still, his life is exhausted, his heat has subsided, and his faculties are broken up. When a bhikkhu has entered upon the cessation of perception and feeling, his bodily formations have ceased and are quite still, his verbal formations have ceased and are quite still, his mental formations have ceased and are quite still, his life is unexhausted, his heat has not subsided, his faculties are quite whole” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

It is not classifiable as formed or unformed, mundane or supramundane. Why? Because it has no individual essence.

<blockquote class="verse"> May it continue here to show<br /> The way to purity of virtue, etc.,<br /> For clansmen seeking out the means<br /> To ferry them across the worlds<br /> For just as long as in this world<br /> Shall last that name “Enlightened One,”<br /> By which, thus purified in mind,<br /> Is known the Greatest Sage, World Chief. </blockquote>
