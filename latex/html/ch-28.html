<p>The eight should be understood as follows: (1) knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall, which is insight free from imperfections and steady on its course, (2) knowledge of contemplation of dissolution, (3) knowledge of appearance as terror, (4) knowledge of contemplation of danger, (5) knowledge of contemplation of dispassion, (6) knowledge of desire for deliverance, (7) knowledge of contemplation of reflection, and (8) knowledge of equanimity about formations.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001076">

<p>“Knowledge in conformity with truth as ninth” is a term for conformity. </p>
<p>So one who wants to perfect this should make these kinds of knowledge his task, starting with knowledge of rise and fall free from imperfections. </p>

The knowledge of rise and fall already dealt with, being <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{725|667}</small></span>disabled by the ten imperfections, was not capable of observing the three characteristics in their true nature; but once freed from imperfections, it is able to do so.

What is that? Firstly, the characteristic of impermanence does not become apparent because when rise and fall are not given attention, it is concealed by continuity. The characteristic of pain does not become apparent because, when continuous oppression is not given attention, it is concealed by the postures. The characteristic of not-self does not become apparent because when resolution into the various elements is not given attention, it is concealed by compactness. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.4" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  However, when continuity is disrupted by discerning rise and fall, the characteristic of impermanence becomes apparent in its true nature. </p>
<p>When the postures are exposed by attention to continuous oppression, the characteristic of pain becomes apparent in its true nature. When the resolution of the compact is effected by resolution into elements, the characteristic of not-self becomes apparent in its true nature.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001077">

<p><a name="XXI.12" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.12" ><b class="bfseries">§12.</b></a></a>  Herein, <em>after reflecting on an object</em> is having reflected on, having known, any object; the meaning is, having seen it as liable to destruction and fall. <em>Understanding of the contemplation of dissolution</em>: any understanding of the contemplation of the dissolution of the knowledge arisen after reflecting on the object as liable to destruction and fall is called <em>knowledge of insight</em>. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[642]</i></span> <em>How </em>has the meaning of a question showing desire to expound. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.13" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.13" ><b class="bfseries">§13.</b></a></a>  Next, in order to show how that comes about, consciousness with materiality as its object, etc., is said. Herein, consciousness with materiality as its object arises and dissolves: <em>rūpārammaṇaṃ cittaṃ uppajjitvā bhijjati </em>[is the equivalent of] <em>rūpārammaṇaṃ cittaṃ uppajjitvā bhijjati</em>; or the meaning is<em> rūpārammaṇabhāve cittaṃ uppajjitvā bhijjati</em> [alternative grammatical substitution]. <em>Having reflected on that object</em>: having reflected on, having known, that object consisting of materiality; the meaning is, having seen it as liable to destruction and fall. <em>He contemplates the dissolution of that consciousness</em>: by means of a subsequent consciousness he contemplates the dissolution of that consciousness with which that object consisting of materiality was seen as liable to destruction and fall. Hence the Ancients said: “He sees with insight both the known and the knowledge.” </p>
<p><a name="XXI.14" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.14" ><b class="bfseries">§14.</b></a></a>  <em>He contemplates</em> (<em>anupassati</em>): he sees always accordingly (<em>anu anu passati</em>); the meaning is, he sees again and again in various modes. Hence it is said: “He contemplates”: <em>how does he contemplate? He contemplates as impermanent</em>, and so on. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.15" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.15" ><b class="bfseries">§15.</b></a></a>  Herein, dissolution is the culminating point of impermanence, and so the meditator contemplating dissolution contemplates the whole field of formations as <em>impermanent, not as permanent</em>.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001082">
  <sup class="footnotemark">8</sup>
</a> Then, because of the painfulness of what is <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{729|671}</small></span>impermanent and because of the non-existence of self in what is painful, he contemplates that same whole field of formations as <em>painful, not as pleasant, he contemplates it as not-self, not as self</em>. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.16" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  But what is impermanent, painful, not-self, is not something to delight in; and what is not something to delight in is not something to arouse greed for; consequently, when that field of formations is seen as impermanent, painful, not-self, in accordance with the contemplation of dissolution, then <em>he becomes dispassionate, he does not delight; he causes fading away of greed, he does not inflame it</em>. When he does not inflame greed thus, <em>he causes cessation</em> of greed, not its <em>origination</em>, which happens firstly by means of mundane knowledge;<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001083">
  <sup class="footnotemark">9</sup>

<p><a name="XXI.17" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.17" ><b class="bfseries">§17.</b></a></a>  Or alternatively, having thus caused the fading away of greed, and caused the cessation of the seen field of formations, he causes the cessation of the unseen too by means of inferential knowledge, he does not originate it. He gives attention only to its cessation, he sees only its cessation, not its origin, is the meaning. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.18" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.18" ><b class="bfseries">§18.</b></a></a>  Progressing in this way, <em>he relinquishes, he does not grasp</em>. What is meant? [What is meant is that] this contemplation of impermanence, etc., is also called both “relinquishment as giving up” and “relinquishment as entering into” (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Paṭis" >Paṭis</a>

Therefore the bhikkhu who possesses that [contemplation] gives up defilements and enters into Nibbāna in the way stated, he does not grasp (cling to) defilements by causing rebirth, nor does he grasp (cling to) a formed object through failing to see its unsatisfactoriness. Hence it was said: <em>he relinquishes, he does not grasp</em>. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.19" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.19" ><b class="bfseries">§19.</b></a></a>  Now, in order to show which states are abandoned by these three kinds of knowledge, <em>contemplating as impermanent, he abandons the perception of permanence</em>, etc., is said. Herein, delight is craving accompanied by happiness. The rest is as already stated. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.20" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.20" ><b class="bfseries">§20.</b></a></a>  As to the stanzas: <em>the substitution of the object</em> [means that] after seeing the dissolution of materiality, there is the substitution of another object for that first object by seeing the dissolution of the consciousness by which the dissolution [of materiality] was seen. <em>Transference of understanding</em> is the abandoning of rise and the specializing in fall. <em>The power of adverting</em> is the ability, after seeing the dissolution of materiality, to advert immediately for the purpose of seeing the dissolution of the consciousness that had that dissolution as its object. <em>Are insight following reflection</em>: this is called contemplation of dissolution after reflecting on an object. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.21" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.21" ><b class="bfseries">§21.</b></a></a>  <em>Defining both to be alike by inference from that same object</em>: the meaning is that by inference, by induction, from the object seen by actual experience he defines <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{730|672}</small></span>both [the seen and the unseen] to have a single individual essence thus, “The field of formations dissolved in the past, and will break up in the future, just as it does [in the present].” And this is said by the Ancients: </p>

The meaning is that he attaches importance to it, inclines, tends, leans towards it. <em>Are insight in the mark of fall</em>: what is meant is that this is called insight into the characteristic of fall. </p>

Just as a man with eyes standing on the bank of a pond or on the bank of a river during heavy rain would see large bubbles appearing on the surface of the water and breaking up as soon as they appeared, so too he sees how formations break up all the time.

<p><a name="XXI.29" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.29" ><b class="bfseries">§29.</b></a></a>  As he repeats, develops and cultivates in this way the contemplation of dissolution, the object of which is cessation consisting in the destruction, fall and breakup of all formations, then formations classed according to all kinds of becoming, generation, destiny, station, or abode of beings, appear to him in the form of a great terror, as lions, tigers, leopards, bears, hyenas, spirits, ogres, fierce bulls, savage dogs, rut-maddened wild elephants, hideous venomous serpents, thunderbolts, charnel grounds, battlefields, flaming coal pits, etc., appear to a timid man who wants to live in peace. When he sees how past formations have ceased, present ones are ceasing, and those to be generated in the future will cease in just the same way, then what is called knowledge of appearance as terror arises in him at that stage. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.30" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.30" ><b class="bfseries">§30.</b></a></a>  <em>Here is a simile</em>: a woman’s three sons had offended against the king, it seems. The king ordered their heads to be cut off. She went with her sons to the place of their execution. When they had cut off the eldest one’s head, they set about cutting off the middle one’s head. Seeing the eldest one’s head already cut off and the middle one’s head being cut off, she gave up hope for the youngest, thinking, “He too will fare like them.” Now, the meditator’s seeing the cessation of past formations is like the woman’s seeing the eldest son’s head cut off. His <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{732|674}</small></span>seeing the cessation of those present is like her seeing the middle one’s head being cut off. His seeing the cessation of those in the future, thinking, “Formations to be generated in the future will cease too,” is like her giving up hope for the youngest son, thinking, “He too will fare like them.” When he sees in this way, knowledge of appearance as terror arises in him at that stage. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.31" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.31" ><b class="bfseries">§31.</b></a></a>  Also another simile: a woman with an infected womb had, it seems, given birth to ten children. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[646]</i></span> Of these, nine had already died and one was dying in her hands. There was another in her womb. Seeing that nine were dead and the tenth was dying, she gave up hope about the one in her womb, thinking, “It too will fare just like them.” Herein, the meditator’s seeing the cessation of past formations is like the woman’s remembering the death of the nine children. The meditator’s seeing the cessation of those present is like her seeing the moribund state of the one in her hands. His seeing the cessation of those in the future is like her giving up hope about the one in her womb. When he sees in this way, knowledge of appearance as terror arises in him at that stage. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.32" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.32" ><b class="bfseries">§32.</b></a></a>  But does the knowledge of appearance as terror [itself] fear or does it not fear? It does not fear. For it is simply the mere judgment that past formations have ceased, present ones are ceasing, and future ones will cease.

<h3 id="a0000000384">Insight Leading to Emergence</h3>
<p><a name="XXI.83" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.83" ><b class="bfseries">§83.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{748|690}</small></span>Now, when this clansman has reached equanimity about formations thus, his insight has reached its culmination and leads to emergence. “Insight that has reached culmination” or “insight leading to emergence” are names for the three kinds of knowledge beginning with equanimity about formations, [that is, equanimity about formations, conformity, and change-of-lineage]. It has “reached its culmination” because it has reached the culminating final stage. It is called “leading to emergence” because it goes towards emergence. The path is called “emergence” because it emerges externally from the objective basis interpreted as a sign and also internally from occurrence [of defilement].<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001110">

<p><a name="XXI.84" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.84" ><b class="bfseries">§84.</b></a></a>  Herein, for the purpose of clarification there is this list of the kinds of emergence classed according to the manner of interpreting: (1) after interpreting the internal<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001111">

How? </p>
<p><a name="XXI.85" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.85" ><b class="bfseries">§85.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{749|691}</small></span>Here (1) someone does his interpreting at the start with his own internal formations. After interpreting them he sees them. But emergence of the path does not come about through seeing the bare internal only since the external must be seen too, so he sees that another’s aggregates, as well as unclung-to formations [inanimate things], are impermanent, painful, not-self. At one time <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[662]</i></span> he comprehends the internal and at another time the external. As he does so, insight joins with the path while he is comprehending the internal. It is said of him that “after interpreting the internal it emerges from the internal.” (2) If his insight joins with the path at the time when he is comprehending the external, it is said of him that “after interpreting the internal it emerges from the external.” (3) Similarly in the case of “after interpreting the external it emerges from the external,” and (4) “from the internal.” </p>
<p><a name="XXI.86" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.86" ><b class="bfseries">§86.</b></a></a>  (5) Another does his interpreting at the start with materiality. When he has done that, he sees the materiality of the primaries and the materiality derived from them all together. But emergence does not come about through the seeing of bare materiality only since the immaterial must be seen too, so he sees as the immaterial [mentality] the feeling, perception, formations and consciousness that have arisen by making that materiality their object. At one time he comprehends the material and at another the immaterial. As he does so, insight joins with the path while he is comprehending materiality. It is said of him that “after interpreting the material it emerges from the material.” (6) But if his insight joins with the path at the time when he is comprehending the immaterial, it is said of him that “after interpreting the material it emerges from the immaterial.” (7) Similarly in the case of “after interpreting the immaterial it emerges from the immaterial,” and (8) “from the material.” </p>
<p><a name="XXI.87" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.87" ><b class="bfseries">§87.</b></a></a>  (9) When he has done his interpreting in this way, “All that is subject to arising is subject to cessation” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XXI.88" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.88" ><b class="bfseries">§88.</b></a></a>  (10) One man comprehends formations as impermanent at the start. But emergence does not come about through mere comprehending as impermanent since there must be comprehension of them as painful and not-self too, so he comprehends them as painful and not-self. As he does so, emergence comes about while he is comprehending them as impermanent. It is said of him that “after interpreting as impermanent it emerges from the impermanent,” (11)–(12) But if emergence comes about in him while he is comprehending them as painful … as not-self, then it is said that “after interpreting as impermanent it emerges from the painful … from the not-self.” Similarly in the cases of emergence after interpreting (13)–(15) as painful and (16)–(18) as not-self. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.89" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.89" ><b class="bfseries">§89.</b></a></a>  And whether they have interpreted [at the start] as impermanent or as painful or as not-self, when the time of emergence comes, if the emergence takes place [while contemplating] as impermanent, then all three persons acquire the faculty of faith since they have great resolution; they are liberated by the signless liberation, and so they become faith devotees at the moment of the first path; and in the remaining seven stages they are liberated by faith. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[663]</i></span> If the emergence is from the painful, then the three persons acquire the faculty of concentration <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{750|692}</small></span>since they have great tranquillity; they are liberated by the desireless liberation, and in all eight states they are body witnesses. Of them, the one who has an immaterial jhāna as the basis for his insight is, in the case of the highest fruition, both-ways liberated. And then if the emergence takes place [while contemplating] as not-self, the three persons acquire the faculty of understanding since they have great wisdom; they are liberated by the void liberation. They become Dhamma devotees at the moment of the first path. In the next six instances they become attained to vision. In the case of the highest fruit they are liberated by understanding. </p>
<h3 id="a0000000385">The Twelve Similes</h3>
<p><a name="XXI.90" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.90" ><b class="bfseries">§90.</b></a></a>  Now, twelve similes should be understood in order to explain this insight leading to emergence and the kinds of knowledge that precede and follow it. Here is the list: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> (1) The fruit bat, (2) the black snake, and (3) the house,<br /> (4) The oxen, and(5) the ghoul, (6) the child,<br /> (7) Hunger, and (8) thirst, and (9) cold, and (10) heat,<br /> And (11) darkness, and (12) by poison, too. </blockquote>
<p>A pause can be made to bring in these similes anywhere among the kinds of knowledge from appearance as terror onwards. But if they are brought in here, then all becomes clear from appearance as terror up to fruition knowledge, which is why it was said that they should be brought in here.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001112">

<p><a name="XXI.91" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.91" ><b class="bfseries">§91.</b></a></a>  <em>1. The Fruit Bat.</em> There was a fruit bat, it seems. She had alighted on a honey tree (<em>madhuka</em>) with five branches, thinking, “I shall find flowers or fruits here.” She investigated one branch but saw no flowers or fruits there worth taking. And as with the first so too she tried the second, the third, the fourth, and the fifth, but saw nothing. She thought, “This tree is barren; there is nothing worth taking here,” so she lost interest in the tree. She climbed up on a straight branch, and poking her head through a gap in the foliage, she looked upwards, flew up into the air and alighted on another tree. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.92" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.92" ><b class="bfseries">§92.</b></a></a>  Herein, the meditator should be regarded as like the fruit bat. The five aggregates as objects of clinging are like the honey tree with the five branches. The meditator’s interpreting of the five aggregates is like the fruit bat’s alighting on the tree. His comprehending the materiality aggregate and, seeing nothing there worth taking, comprehending the remaining aggregates is like her trying each branch and, seeing nothing there worth taking, trying the rest. His triple knowledge beginning with desire for deliverance, after he has become dispassionate towards the five aggregates <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[664]</i></span> through seeing their characteristic of impermanence, etc., is like her thinking “This tree is barren; there is nothing worth taking here” and losing interest. His conformity knowledge is like her climbing up the straight branch. His change-of-lineage knowledge is like her poking her head out and looking upwards. His path knowledge is like her flying up into the air. His fruition knowledge is like her alighting on a different tree. </p>

The Black Snake.</em> This simile has already been given (<a href="ch-28.html#XXI.49" >§49</a>). But the application of the simile here is this. Change-of-lineage knowledge is like throwing the snake away. Path knowledge is like the man’s standing and looking back whence he had come after getting free from it. Fruition knowledge is like his standing in a place free from fear after he had got away. This is the difference. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.94" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.94" ><b class="bfseries">§94.</b></a></a>  <em>3. The House.</em> The owner of a house, it seems, ate his meal in the evening, climbed into his bed and fell asleep. The house caught fire. When he woke up and saw the fire, he was frightened. He thought, “It would be good if I could get out without getting burnt.” Looking round, he saw a way. Getting out, he quickly went away to a safe place and stayed there. </p>

Knowledge of appearance as terror after entering upon the right way and seeing the three characteristics is like the time when the man was frightened on waking up and seeing the fire. Knowledge of desire for deliverance is like the man’s looking for a way out. Conformity knowledge is like the man’s seeing the way. Change-of-lineage is like the man’s going away quickly. Fruition knowledge is like his staying in a safe place. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.96" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.96" ><b class="bfseries">§96.</b></a></a>  <em>4. The Oxen.</em> One night, it seems, while a farmer was sleeping his oxen broke out of their stable and escaped. When he went there at dawn and looked in, he found that they had escaped. Going to find them, he saw the king’s oxen. He thought that they were his and drove them back. When it got light, he recognized that they were not his but the king’s oxen. He was frightened. Thinking, “I shall escape before the king’s men seize me for a thief and bring me to ruin and destruction,” he abandoned the oxen. Escaping quickly, he stopped in a place free from fear. </p>

The meditator’s recognizing the five aggregates as impermanent, painful, and not-self by means of the three characteristics is like the man’s recognizing the oxen as the king’s when it got light. Knowledge of appearance as terror is like the time when the man was frightened. Desire for deliverance is like the man’s desire to leave them and go away. Change-of-lineage is like the man’s actual leaving. The path is like his escaping.

At night, thinking he was asleep, she went to the place where the dead were exposed and ate human flesh. He wondered where she was going and followed her. When he saw her eating human flesh, he knew that she was a non-human being. He was frightened, and he thought, “I shall escape before she eats me.” Quickly escaping, he went to a safe place and stayed there. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.99" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.99" ><b class="bfseries">§99.</b></a></a>  Herein, taking the aggregates as “I” and “mine” is like the man’s living with the ghoul.

Appearance as terror is <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{752|694}</small></span>like the time when the man was frightened. Desire for deliverance is like his desire to escape.

While sitting on an upper floor she heard the sound of a child in the street. Wondering, “Is someone hurting my child?,” she hurried down. Mistaking the child for her own son, she picked up someone else’s son. Then she recognized that it was someone else’s son, and she was ashamed and looked about her. She thought, “Let no one say I am a baby thief” and she put the child down there and then, and she quickly returned to the upper floor and sat down. </p>

<h3 id="a0000000386">The Difference in the Noble Path’s Factors, Etc.</h3>
<p><a name="XXI.111" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.111" ><b class="bfseries">§111.</b></a></a>  This knowledge of equanimity about formations governs the fact that the meditator keeps apart. It furthermore governs the difference in the [number of the] noble path’s enlightenment factors, path factors, and jhāna factors, the mode of progress, and the kind of liberation. For while some elders say that it is the jhāna used as the basis for insight [leading to emergence] that governs the difference in the [number of] enlightenment factors, path factors, and jhāna factors, and some say that it is the aggregates made the object of insight that govern it, and some say that it is the personal bent that governs it,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001113">
  <sup class="footnotemark">39</sup>
</a> yet it is only this preliminary insight and insight leading to emergence that should be understood to govern it in their doctrine. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.112" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.112" ><b class="bfseries">§112.</b></a></a>  To deal with these [three theories] in order: According to governance by insight, the path arisen in a bare-insight (dry-insight) worker, and the path arisen in one who possesses a jhāna attainment but who has not made the jhāna the basis for insight, and the path made to arise by comprehending unrelated formations after using the first jhāna as the basis for insight, are <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[667]</i></span> paths of the first jhāna only. In each case there are seven enlightenment factors, eight path factors, and five jhāna factors. For while their preliminary insight can be accompanied by joy and it can be accompanied by equanimity, when their insight reaches the state of equanimity about formations at the time of emergence it is accompanied by joy. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.113" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.113" ><b class="bfseries">§113.</b></a></a>  When paths are made to arise by using the second, third, and fourth jhānas in the fivefold reckoning as the basis for insight, then the jhāna in those paths has respectively four, three, and two factors. In each case, however, the path factors number seven, and in the fourth case there are six enlightenment factors. This difference is due both to governance by the basic jhāna and to governance by insight. For again, while their preliminary insight can be accompanied by joy and it can be accompanied by equanimity, their insight leading to emergence is accompanied by joy only. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.114" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.114" ><b class="bfseries">§114.</b></a></a>  However, when the path is produced by making the fifth jhāna the basis for insight, then the jhāna factors number two, that is, equanimity and unification <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{754|696}</small></span>of the mind, and there are six enlightenment factors and seven path factors. This difference too is due to both kinds of governance. For in this case the preliminary insight is either accompanied by joy or accompanied by equanimity, but that leading to emergence is accompanied by equanimity only. The same method applies in the case of the path made to arise by making the immaterial jhānas the basis for insight. </p>
<p>Also when, after emerging from jhāna made the basis for insight, the path has been produced by comprehending no matter what formations [unrelated to that jhāna], then it is the attainment emerged from at the point nearest to the path that makes it like itself, as the colour of the soil does an monitor lizard’s colour. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.115" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.115" ><b class="bfseries">§115.</b></a></a>  But in the case of the second elder’s theory the path is like the attainment, whatever it may be, which was instrumental in producing the path through the comprehension of any of its states after emergence from it. And here governance by insight should be understood in the same way as before. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.116" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.116" ><b class="bfseries">§116.</b></a></a>  In the case of the third elder’s theory the path is like that jhāna, whichever it may be, that suits the personal bent, which jhāna was instrumental in producing the path through the comprehension of any of its states in using it as the basis for insight. But this is not accomplished by mere bent alone unless the jhāna has been made the basis for insight or unless the jhāna has been comprehended; and this meaning should be illustrated by the Nandakovāda Sutta (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#M" >M</a>
	]
</span>III 277</b>, and Commentary). And here too, governance by insight should be understood in the same way as before. </p>
<p>This, firstly, is how it should be understood that equanimity about formations governs the [numbers of] enlightenment factors, path factors, and jhāna factors. </p>
<p><a name="XXI.117" ><a href="ch-28.html#XXI.117" ><b class="bfseries">§117.</b></a></a>  [<em>Progress.</em>] But if [insight] has from the start only been able to suppress defilements with difficulty, with effort and with prompting, then it is called “of difficult progress.” <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[668]</i></span> The opposite kind is called “of easy progress.” And when the manifestation of the path, the goal of insight, is slowly effected after defilements have been suppressed, then it is called “of sluggish direct-knowledge.” The opposite kind is called “of swift direct-knowledge.” So this equanimity about formations stands at the arrival point and gives its own name to the path in each case, and so the path has four names [according to the kind of progress] (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

For it is not through the connectedness of states that the characteristic of impermanence becomes apparent to one who rightly observes rise and fall, but rather the characteristic becomes more thoroughly evident through their disconnectedness, as if they were iron darts. ‘<em>When the postures are exposed</em>’ means when the concealment of the pain that is actually inherent in the postures is exposed. For when pain arises in a posture, the next posture adopted removes the pain, as it were, concealing it. But once it is correctly known how the pain in any posture is shifted by substituting another posture for that one, then the concealment of the pain that is in them is exposed because it has become evident that formations are being incessantly overwhelmed by pain. ‘<em>Resolution of the compact</em>’ is effected by resolving [what appears compact] in this way, ‘The earth element is one, the water element is another’ etc., distinguishing each one; and in this way, ‘Contact is one, feeling is another’ etc., distinguishing each one. ‘<em>When the resolution of the compact is effected</em>’ means that what is compact as a mass and what is compact as a function or as an object has been analyzed. For when material and immaterial states have arisen mutually steadying each other, [mentality and materiality, for example,] then, owing to misinterpreting that as a unity, compactness of mass is assumed through failure to subject formations to pressure. And likewise compactness of function is assumed when, although definite differences exist in such and such states’ functions, they are taken as one. And likewise compactness of object is assumed when, although differences exist in the ways in which states that take objects make them their objects, those objects are taken as one. But when they are seen after resolving them by means of knowledge into these elements, they disintegrate like froth subjected to compression by the hand. They are mere states (<em>dhamma</em>) occurring due to conditions and void. In this way the characteristic of not-self becomes more evident” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>342</b>). Nevertheless, though it eliminates the signs of permanence, of lastingness, and of self, it still possesses a sign itself and is occupied with states that possess a sign. Again, the Abhidhamma is the teaching in the ultimate sense, and in the ultimate sense the cause of a signless path is wanting. For the signless liberation is stated in accordance with the contemplation of impermanence, and in that the faith faculty predominates. But the faith faculty is not represented by any one of the factors of the path. And so it cannot give its name to the path since it forms no part of it. In the case of the other two, the desireless liberation is due to the contemplation of pain, and the void liberation is due to the contemplation of not-self. Now the concentration faculty predominates in the desireless liberation and the understanding faculty in the void liberation. So since these are factors of the path as well, they can give their own names to the path; but there is no signless path because the factor is wanting. So some say. But there are others who say that there is a signless path, and that although it does not get its name from the way insight arrives at it, still it gets its name from a special quality of its own and from its object. In their opinion the desireless and void paths should also get their names from special qualities of their own and from their objects too. That is wrong. Why? Because the path gets its names for two reasons, that is, because of its own nature and because of what it opposes—the meaning is, because of its individual essence and because of what it is contrary to. For the desireless path is free from desire due to greed, etc., and the void path is free from greed too, so they both get their names from their individual essence. Similarly, the desireless path is the contrary of desire and the void path is the contrary of misinterpretation as self, so they get their names from what they oppose. On the other hand, the signless path gets its name only from its own nature owing to the non-existence in it of the signs of greed, etc., or of the signs of permanence, etc., but not owing to what it opposes. For it does not oppose the contemplation of impermanence, which has as its object the sign of formations [as formed], but remains in agreement with it. So a signless path is altogether inadmissible by the Abhidhamma method. This is why it is said, ‘This refers to the way in which insight arrives at the path and is expressed in the literal sense’ (§72). 
“However, by the Suttanta method a signless path is admissible. For according to that, in whatever way insight leading to emergence (see §83) effects its comprehending it still leads on to emergence of the path, and when it is at the point of arrival it gives its own name to the path accordingly—when emerging owing to comprehension as impermanent the path is signless, when emerging owing to comprehension as painful it is desireless, and when emerging owing to comprehension as not-self it is void. Taking this as a sutta commentary, therefore, three liberations are differentiated here. But in the Paṭisambhidā the deliverance from misinterpreting, from the sign and from desire, are taken respectively as the arrival of the three kinds of comprehension at that deliverance, and what is described is a corresponding state of void liberation, etc., respectively in the paths that follow upon that deliverance. There is no question of treating that literally, which is why he said, ‘However, in the Paṭisambhidā insight knowledge’ and so on” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
