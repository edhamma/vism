For when his virtue is thus washed clean of stains by the waters of such special qualities as fewness of wishes, contentment, effacement, seclusion, dispersal, energy, and modest needs, it will become quite purified; and his vows will succeed as well. And–so, when his whole behaviour has been purified by the special quality of blameless virtue and vows and he has become established in the [first] three of the ancient Noble Ones’ heritages, he may become worthy to attain to the fourth called “delight in development” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<h1 id="a0000000070">2 Meaning</h1>
<p><a name="II.4" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  1. Herein, <em>as to meaning</em>, in the first place. </p>
<p>i. It is “refuse” (<em>paṃsukūla</em>) since, owing to its being found on refuse in any such place as a street, a charnel ground, or a midden, it belongs, as it were, to the refuse in the sense of being dumped in anyone of these places. Or alternatively: like refuse it gets to a vile state (<em>PAṂSU viya KUcchitabhāvaṃ ULAti</em>), thus it is “refuse” (<em>paṃsukūla</em>); it goes to a vile state, is what is meant. The wearing of a refuse-[rag], which has acquired its derivative name<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000480">
  <sup class="footnotemark">1</sup>
</a> in this way, is “refuse-[rag-wearing]” (<em>paṃsukūla</em>). That is his habit, thus he is a “refuse-[rag-wear-]er” (<em>paṃsukūlika</em>). The practice (<em>aṅga</em>) of the refuse-[rag-wear-]er is the “refuse-[rag-wear-]er’s practice” (<em>paṃsukūlikaṅga</em>). It is the action that is called the “practice.” Therefore it should be understood as a term for that by undertaking which one becomes a refuse-[rag-wear-]er. </p>
<p>ii. In the same way, he has the habit of [wearing] the triple robe (<em>ti-cīvara</em>)—in other words, the cloak of patches, the upper garment, and the inner clothing—thus he is a “triple-robe-[wear-]er” (<em>tecīvarika</em>). His practice is called the “triple-robe-wearer’s practice.” </p>
<p><a name="II.5" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.5" ><b class="bfseries">§5.</b></a></a>  iii. The dropping (<em>pāta</em>) of the lumps (<em>piṇḍa</em>) of material sustenance (<em>āmisa</em>) called alms (<em>bhikkhā</em>) is “alms food” (<em>piṇḍapāta</em>); the falling (<em>nipatana</em>) into the bowl of lumps (<em>piṇḍa</em>) given by others, is what is meant. He gleans that alms food (that falling of lumps), he seeks it by approaching such and such a family, thus he is called an “alms-food [eat-]er” (<em>piṇḍapātika</em>). Or his vow is to gather (<em>patituṃ</em>)<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000481">
  <sup class="footnotemark">2</sup>
</a> the lump (<em>piṇḍa</em>), thus he is a “lump-gatherer” (<em>piṇḍapātin</em>). To “gather” is to wander for. A “lump-gatherer” (<em>piṇḍapātin</em>) is the same as an “alms-food-eater” (<em>piṇḍapātika</em>). The practice of the alms-food-eater is the “alms-food-eater’s practice.” </p>
<p><a name="II.6" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.6" ><b class="bfseries">§6.</b></a></a>  iv. It is a hiatus (<em>avakhaṇḍana</em>) that is called a “gap” (<em>dāna</em>).<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000482">
  <sup class="footnotemark">3</sup>
</a> It is removed (<em>apeta</em>) from a gap, thus it is called “gapless” (<em>apadāna</em>); the meaning is, it is without hiatus. It is together with (<em>saha</em>) what is gapless (<em>apadāna</em>), thus it is “with the gapless” (<em>sapadāna</em>); devoid of hiatus—from house to house—is what is meant. His habit is to wander on what-is-with-the-gapless, thus he is a “gapless wanderer” (<em>sapadāna-cārin</em>). A gapless wanderer is the same as a “house-to-house-seeker” (<em>sapadāna-cārika</em>). His practice is the “house-to-house-seeker’s practice.” </p>
<p><a name="II.7" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.7" ><b class="bfseries">§7.</b></a></a>  v. Eating in one session is “one-session.” He has that habit, thus he is a “one-sessioner.” His practice is the “one-sessioner’s practice.” <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{115|57}</small></span>vi. Alms (<em>piṇḍa</em>) in one bowl (<em>patta</em>) only because of refusing a second vessel, is “bowl-alms” (<em>patta-piṇḍa</em>). Now, making “bowl alms” (<em>patta-piṇḍa</em>) the name for the taking of alms food in the bowl: bowl-alms-food is his habit, thus he is a “bowl-food-eater” (<em>pattapiṇḍika</em>). His practice is the “bowl-food-eater’s practice.” </p>
<p><a name="II.8" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.8" ><b class="bfseries">§8.</b></a></a>  vii. “No” (<em>khalu</em>) is a particle in the sense of refusing. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[61]</i></span> Food (<em>bhatta</em>) obtained later by one who has shown that he is satisfied is called “later-food” (<em>pacchā-bhatta</em>). The eating of that later food is “later-food-eating.” Making “later-food” (<em>pacchā-bhatta</em>) the name for that later-food-eating: later-food is his habit, thus he is a “later-food-[eat-]er” (<em>pacchābhattika</em>). Not a later-food-eater is a “no-later-food-[eat-]er” (<em>khalu-pacchābhattika</em>), [that is, a “later-food-refuser”]. This is the name for one who as an undertaking refuses extra food. But it is said in the commentary<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000483">
  <sup class="footnotemark">4</sup>
</a> “Khalu is a certain kind of bird. When it has taken a fruit into its beak and that drops, it does not eat any more. This [bhikkhu] is like that.” Thus he is “a later-food-refuser” (<em>khalu-pacchā-bhattika</em>). His practice is the “later-food-refuser’s practice.” </p>
<p><a name="II.9" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.9" ><b class="bfseries">§9.</b></a></a>  viii. His habit is dwelling in the forest, thus he is a “forest-dweller.” His practice is the “forest-dweller’s practice.” </p>
<p>ix. Dwelling at the root of a tree is “tree-root-dwelling.” He has that habit, thus he is a “tree-root-dweller.” The practice of the tree-root-dweller is the “tree-root-dweller’s practice.” x., xi. Likewise with the open-air-dweller and the charnel-ground-dweller. </p>
<p><a name="II.10" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.10" ><b class="bfseries">§10.</b></a></a>  xii. Only what has been distributed (<em>yad eva santhata</em>) is “as distributed” (<em>yathāsanthata</em>). This is a term for the resting place first allotted thus “This one falls to you.” He has the habit of dwelling in that as distributed, thus he is an “as-distributed-user” (<em>yathāsanthatika</em>), [that is, an “any-bed-user”]. His practice is the “any-bed-user’s practice.” </p>
<p>xiii. He has the habit of keeping to the sitting [posture when resting], refusing to lie down, thus he is a “sitter.” His practice is the “sitter’s practice.” </p>
<p><a name="II.11" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.11" ><b class="bfseries">§11.</b></a></a>  All these, however, are the practices (<em>aṅga</em>) of a bhikkhu who is ascetic (<em>dhuta</em>) because he has shaken off (<em>dhuta</em>) defilement by undertaking one or other of them. Or the knowledge that has got the name “ascetic” (<em>dhuta</em>) because it shakes off (<em>dhunana</em>) defilement is a practice (<em>aṅga</em>) belonging to these, thus they are “ascetic practices” (<em>dhutaṅga</em>). Or alternatively, they are ascetic (<em>dhuta</em>) because they shake off (<em>niddhunana</em>) opposition, and they are practices (<em>aṅga</em>) because they are a way (<em>paṭipatti</em>). </p>
<p>This, firstly, is how the exposition should be known here as to meaning. </p>
<h1 id="a0000000071">3 Characteristic</h1>
<p><a name="II.12" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.12" ><b class="bfseries">§12.</b></a></a>  <em>2. </em>All of them have as their characteristic the volition of undertaking. For this is said [in the commentary]: “He who does the undertaking is a person. That whereby he does the undertaking is states of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants. The volition of the act of undertaking is the ascetic practice. What it rejects is the instance.” All have the function of eliminating cupidity, and they <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{116|58}</small></span>manifest themselves with the production of non-cupidity. For their proximate cause they have the noble states consisting of fewness of wishes, and so on. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[62]</i></span> This is how the exposition should be known <em>as to characteristic, etc</em>., here. </p>
<p><a name="II.13" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.13" ><b class="bfseries">§13.</b></a></a>  <em>3. </em>As regards the five beginning with <em>the undertaking </em>and<em> directions</em>: during the Blessed One’s lifetime all ascetic practices should be undertaken in the Blessed One’s presence. After his attainment of Nibbāna this should be done in the presence of a principal disciple. When he is not available it should be done in the presence of one whose cankers are destroyed, of a non-returner, of a once-returner, of a stream-enterer, of one who knows the three Piṭakas, of one who knows two of the Piṭakas, of one who knows one of the Piṭakas, of one who knows one Collection,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000484">
  <sup class="footnotemark">5</sup>
</a> of a teacher of the Commentaries. When he is not available it should be done in the presence of an observer of an ascetic practice. When he is not available, then after one has swept out the shrine terrace they can be undertaken seated in a reverential posture as though pronouncing them in the Fully Enlightened One’s presence. Also it is permitted to undertake them by oneself. </p>
<p>And here should be told the story of the senior of the two brothers who were elders at Cetiyapabbata and their fewness of wishes with respect to the ascetic practices<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000485">

<h1 id="a0000000072">4 Undertaking, directions, etc.</h1>
<p><a name="II.14" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.14" ><b class="bfseries">§14.</b></a></a>  Now, we shall proceed to comment on the undertaking, directions, grade, breach and benefits, of each one [separately]. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000073">4.1 Refuse-rag-wearer</h2>
<p>i. First, the <em>refuse-rag-wearer’s practice</em> is undertaken with one of these two statements: “I refuse robes given by householders” or “I undertake the refuse-rag-wearer’s practice.” This, firstly, is the <em>undertaking</em>. </p>
<p><a name="II.15" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.15" ><b class="bfseries">§15.</b></a></a>  One who has done this should get a robe of one of the following kinds: one from a charnel ground, one from a shop, a cloth from a street, a cloth from a midden, one from a childbed, an ablution cloth, a cloth from a washing place, one worn going to and returning from [the charnel ground], one scorched by fire, one gnawed by cattle, one gnawed by ants, one gnawed by rats, one cut at the end, one cut at the edge, one carried as a flag, a robe from a shrine, an ascetic’s robe, one from a consecration, one produced by supernormal power, one from a highway, one borne by the wind, one presented by deities, one from the sea. Taking one of these robe cloths, he should tear off and throw away the weak parts, and then wash the sound parts and make up a robe. He can use it after getting rid of his old robe given by householders. </p>
<p><a name="II.16" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  Herein, “<em>one from a charnel ground</em>” is one dropped on a charnel ground. </p>
<p><span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{117|59}</small></span>“<em>One from a shop</em>” is one dropped at the door of a shop. </p>
<p>“<em>A cloth from a street</em>” is a cloth thrown into a street from inside a window by those who seek merit. </p>
<p>“<em>A cloth from a midden</em>” <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[63]</i></span> is a cloth thrown onto a place for rubbish. </p>
<p>“<em>One from a childbed</em>” is a cloth thrown away after wiping up the stains of childbirth with it. The mother of Tissa the Minister, it seems, had the stains of childbirth wiped up with a cloth worth a hundred [pieces], and thinking, “The refuse-rag wearers will take it,” she had it thrown onto the Tālaveli Road.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000486">

<p><a name="II.17" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.17" ><b class="bfseries">§17.</b></a></a>  “<em>An ablution cloth</em>” is one that people who are made by devil doctors to bathe themselves, including their heads, are accustomed to throw away as a “cloth of ill luck.” </p>
<p>“<em>A cloth from washing place</em>” is rags thrown away at a washing place where bathing is done. </p>
<p>“<em>One worn going to and coming from</em>” is one that people throw away after they have gone to a charnel ground and returned and bathed. </p>
<p>“<em>One scorched by fire</em>” is one partly scorched by fire; for people throw that away. </p>
<p>“<em>One gnawed by cattle,</em>” etc., are obvious; for people throw away such as these too. </p>
<p>“<em>One carried as a flag</em>”: Those who board a ship do so after hoisting a flag. It is allowable to take this when they have gone out of sight. Also it is allowable, when the two armies have gone away, to take a flag that has been hoisted on a battlefield. </p>
<p><a name="II.18" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.18" ><b class="bfseries">§18.</b></a></a>  “<em>A robe from a shrine</em>” is an offering made by draping a termite-mound [in cloth]. </p>

<p>“<em>One borne by the wind</em>” is one that falls a long way off, having been carried by the wind. It is allowable to take it if the owners are not in sight. </p>
<p>“<em>One presented by deities</em>” is one given by deities like that given to the Elder Anuruddha (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p>“<em>One from the sea</em>” is one washed up on dry land by the sea waves. </p>
<p><a name="II.19" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.19" ><b class="bfseries">§19.</b></a></a>  One given thus “We give it to the Order” or got by those who go out for alms-cloth is not a refuse-rag. And in the case of one presented by a bhikkhu, one given <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{118|60}</small></span>after it has been got [at a presentation of robes by householders] at the end of the Rains, or a “resting-place robe” [that is, one automatically supplied by a householder to the occupant of a certain resting place] is not a refuse-rag. It is a refuse-rag only when given after not having been so obtained. And herein, that placed by the donors at a bhikkhu’s feet but given by that bhikkhu to the refuse-rag wearer by placing it in his hand is called pure in one way. That given to a bhikkhu by placing it in his hand but placed by him at the [refuse-rag wearer’s] feet is also pure in one way. That which is both placed at a bhikkhu’s feet and then given by him in the same way is pure in both ways. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[64]</i></span> One obtained by being placed in the hand and [given by being] placed in the hand too is not a strict man’s robe. So a refuse-rag wearer should use the robe after getting to know about the kinds of refuse-rags. These are the <em>directions</em> for it in this instance. </p>
<p><a name="II.20" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.20" ><b class="bfseries">§20.</b></a></a>  The <em>grades</em> are these. There are three kinds of refuse-rag wearers: the strict, the medium, and the mild. Herein, one who takes it only from a charnel ground is strict. One who takes one left [by someone, thinking] “One gone forth will take it” is medium. One who takes one given by being placed at his feet [by a bhikkhu] is mild. </p>
<p>The moment anyone of these of his own choice or inclination agrees to [accept] a robe given by a householder, his ascetic practice is broken. This is the <em>breach</em> in this instance. </p>
<p><a name="II.21" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.21" ><b class="bfseries">§21.</b></a></a>  The <em>benefits</em> are these. He actually practices in conformity with the dependence, because of the words “The going forth by depending on the refuse-rag robe” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

Next there is the <em>triple-robe-wearer’s practice</em>. This is undertaken with one of the following statements: “I refuse a fourth robe” or “I undertake the triple-robe-wearer’s practice.” <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[65]</i></span> </p>
<p>When a triple-robe wearer has got cloth for a robe, he can put it by for as long as, owing to ill-health, he is unable to make it up, or for as long as he does not find a helper, or lacks a needle, etc., and there is no fault in his putting it by. But it is not allowed to put it by once it has been dyed. That is called cheating the ascetic practice. These are the <em>directions</em> for it. </p>
<p><a name="II.24" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.24" ><b class="bfseries">§24.</b></a></a>  This too has three <em>grades</em>.

Or alternatively, they are ascetic (<em>dhuta</em>) because they shake off (<em>niddhunana</em>) opposition, and they are practices (<em>aṅga</em>) because they are a way (<em>paṭipatti</em>).” Now, no one called “ascetic” on account of what is unprofitable could have these as his practices; nor does what is unprofitable shake off anything so that those things to which it belonged as a practice could be called “ascetic practices.” And what is unprofitable does not both shake off cupidity for robes, etc., and become the practice of the way.

Or the cultivation of the forest-dweller’s practice and the tree-root-dweller’s practice here are suitable for one of hating temperament; for hate too subsides in one who dwells there without coming into conflict. </p>
<p>This is the commentary “as to ‘ascetic’ and so on distinguished.” <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[82]</i></span> </p>
<h1 id="a0000000088">7 Groups</h1>
<p><a name="II.87" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.87" ><b class="bfseries">§87.</b></a></a>  <em>6. and 7. As to groups and also singly. </em>Now, <em>6. as to groups</em>: these ascetic practices are in fact only eight, that is to say, three principal and five individual practices. Herein, the three, namely, the house-to-house-seeker’s practice, the one-sessioner’s practice, and the open-air-dweller’s practice, are principal practices. For one who keeps the house-to-house-seeker’s practice will keep the alms-food-eater’s practice; and the bowl-food-eater’s practice and the later-food-refuser’s practice will be well kept by one who keeps the one-sessioner’s practice. And what need has one who keeps the open-air-dweller’s practice to keep the tree-root-dweller’s practice or the any-bed-user’s practice? So there are these three principal practices that, <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{134|76}</small></span>together with the five individual practices, that is to say, the forest-dweller’s practice, the refuse-rag-wearer’s practice, the triple-robe-wearer’s practice, the sitter’s practice, and the charnel-ground-dweller’s practice, come to eight only. </p>
<p><a name="II.88" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.88" ><b class="bfseries">§88.</b></a></a>  Again they come to four, that is to say, two connected with robes, five connected with alms food, five connected with the resting place, and one connected with energy. Herein, it is the sitter’s practice that is connected with energy; the rest are obvious. </p>
<p>Again they all amount to two only, since twelve are dependent on requisites and one on energy. Also they are two according to what is and what is not to be cultivated. For when one cultivating an ascetic practice finds that his meditation subject improves, he should cultivate it; but when he is cultivating one and finds that his meditation subject deteriorates, he should not cultivate it. But when he finds that, whether he cultivates one or not, his meditation subject only improves and does not deteriorate, he should cultivate them out of compassion for later generations. And when he finds that, whether he cultivates them or not, his meditation subject does not improve, he should still cultivate them for the sake of acquiring the habit for the future. So they are of two kinds as what is and what is not to be cultivated. </p>
<p><a name="II.89" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.89" ><b class="bfseries">§89.</b></a></a>  And all are of one kind as volition. For there is only one ascetic practice, namely, that consisting in the volition of undertaking. Also it is said in the Commentary: “It is the volition that is the ascetic practice, they say.” </p>
<h1 id="a0000000089">8 Singly</h1>
<p><a name="II.90" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.90" ><b class="bfseries">§90.</b></a></a>  <em>7. Singly</em>: with thirteen for bhikkhus, eight for bhikkhunīs, twelve for novices, seven for female probationers and female novices, and two for male and female lay followers, there are thus forty-two. </p>
<p><a name="II.91" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.91" ><b class="bfseries">§91.</b></a></a>  If there is a charnel ground in the open that complies with the forest-dweller’s practice, one bhikkhu is able to put all the ascetic practices into effect simultaneously. </p>
<p>But the two, namely, the forest-dweller’s practice and the later-food-refuser’s practice, are forbidden to bhikkhunīs by training precept. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[83]</i></span> And it is hard for them to observe the three, namely, the open-air-dweller’s practice, the tree-root-dweller’s practice, and the charnel-ground-dweller’s practice, because a bhikkhunī is not allowed to live without a companion, and it is hard to find a female companion with like desire for such a place, and even if available, she would not escape having to live in company. This being so, the purpose of cultivating the ascetic practice would scarcely be served. It is because they are reduced by five owing to this inability to make use of certain of them that they are to be understood as eight only for bhikkhunīs. </p>
<p><a name="II.92" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.92" ><b class="bfseries">§92.</b></a></a>  Except for the triple-robe-wearer’s practice all the other twelve as stated should be understood to be for novices, and all the other seven for female probationers and female novices. </p>
<p>The two, namely, the one-sessioner’s practice and the bowl-food-eater’s practice, are proper for male and female lay followers to employ. In this way there are two ascetic practices. </p>
<p>This is the commentary “as to groups and also singly.” </p>
<p><a name="II.93" ><a href="ch-07.html#II.93" ><b class="bfseries">§93.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{135|77}</small></span>And this is the end of the treatise on the ascetic practices to be undertaken for the purpose of perfecting those special qualities of fewness of wishes, contentment, etc., by means of which there comes about the cleansing of virtue as described in the <em>Path of Purification</em>, which is shown under the three headings of virtue, concentration, and understanding, contained in the stanza, “When a wise man, established well in virtue” (<a href="ch-06.html#I.1" >I.1</a>). </p>
<p>The second chapter called “The Description of the Ascetic Practices” in the <em>Path of Purification</em> composed for the purpose of gladdening good people. </p>
