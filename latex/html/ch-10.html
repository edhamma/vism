In the first place one who finds it convenient to live with the teacher in the same monastery can live there while he is making certain of the meditation subject. If it is inconvenient there, he can live in another monastery—a suitable one—a quarter or a half or even a whole league distant. In that case, when he finds he is in doubt about, or has forgotten, some passage in the meditation subject, then he should do the duties in the monastery in good time and set out afterwards, going for alms on the way and arriving at the teacher’s dwelling place after his meal. He should make certain about the meditation subject that day in the teacher’s presence. Next day, after paying homage to the teacher, he should go for alms on his way back and so he can return to his own dwelling place without fatigue. But one who finds no convenient place within even a league should clarify all difficulties about the meditation subject and make quite sure it has been properly attended to. Then he can even go far away and, avoiding a monastery unfavourable to development of concentration, live in one that is favourable. </p>
<h1 id="a0000000108">1 The eighteen faults of a monastery</h1>
<p><a name="IV.2" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.2" ><b class="bfseries">§2.</b></a></a>  Herein, one that is unfavourable has anyone of eighteen faults. These are: (1) largeness, (2) newness, (3) dilapidatedness, (4) a nearby road, (5) a pond, (6) [edible] leaves, (7) flowers, (8) fruits, (9) famousness, (10) a nearby city, (11) nearby timber trees, (12) nearby arable fields, (13) presence of incompatible persons, (14) a nearby port of entry, (15) nearness to the border countries, (16) nearness to the frontier of a kingdom, (17) unsuitability, (18) lack of good friends. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[119]</i></span> One with any of these faults is not favourable. He should not live there. Why? </p>
<p><a name="IV.3" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.3" ><b class="bfseries">§3.</b></a></a>  <em>1. </em>Firstly, people with varying aims collect in a <em>large monastery</em>. They conflict with each other and so neglect the duties. The Enlightenment-tree terrace, etc., remain unswept, the water for drinking and washing is not set out. So if he thinks, “I shall go to the alms-resort village for alms” and takes his bowl and robe and sets out, perhaps he sees that the duties have not been done or that a drinking-water pot is empty, and so the duty has to be done by him unexpectedly. Drinking water must be maintained. By not doing it he would commit a <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{172|114}</small></span>wrongdoing in the breach of a duty. But if he does it, he loses time. He arrives too late at the village and gets nothing because the alms giving is finished. Also, when he goes into retreat, he is distracted by the loud noises of novices and young bhikkhus, and by acts of the Community [being carried out]. However, he can live in a large monastery where all the duties are done and where there are none of the other disturbances. </p>
<p><a name="IV.4" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  <em>2.</em> In <em>a new monastery </em>there is much new building activity. People criticize someone who takes no part in it. But he can live in such a monastery where the bhikkhus say, “Let the venerable one do the ascetic’s duties as much as he likes. We shall see to the building work.” </p>
<p><a name="IV.5" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.5" ><b class="bfseries">§5.</b></a></a>  <em>3.</em> In <em>a dilapidated monastery</em> there is much that needs repair. People criticize someone who does not see about the repairing of at least his own lodging. When he sees to the repairs, his meditation subject suffers. </p>
<p><a name="IV.6" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.6" ><b class="bfseries">§6.</b></a></a>  <em>4.</em> In a monastery with a <em>nearby road</em>, by a main street, visitors keep arriving night and day. He has to give up his own lodging to those who come late, and he has to go and live at the root of a tree or on top of a rock. And next day it is the same. So there is no opportunity [to practice] his meditation subject. But he can live in one where there is no such disturbance by visitors. </p>
<p><a name="IV.7" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.7" ><b class="bfseries">§7.</b></a></a>  <em>5.</em> A <em>pond </em>is a rock pool. Numbers of people come there for drinking water. Pupils of city-dwelling elders supported by the royal family come to do dyeing work. When they ask for vessels, wood, tubs, etc., <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[120]</i></span> they must be shown where these things are. So he is kept all the time on the alert. </p>
<p><a name="IV.8" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.8" ><b class="bfseries">§8.</b></a></a>  <em>6.</em> If he goes with his meditation subject to sit by day where there are many sorts of edible <em>leaves</em>, then women vegetable-gatherers, singing as they pick leaves nearby, endanger his meditation subject by disturbing it with sounds of the opposite sex. </p>
<p><em>7.</em> And where there are many sorts of <em>flowering </em>shrubs in bloom there is the same danger too. </p>
<p><a name="IV.9" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.9" ><b class="bfseries">§9.</b></a></a>  <em>8.</em> Where there are many sorts of <em>fruits </em>such as mangoes, rose-apples and jak-fruits, people who want fruits come and ask for them, and they get angry if he does not give them any, or they take them by force. When walking in the monastery in the evening he sees them and asks, “Why do you do so, lay followers?” they abuse him as they please and even try to evict him. </p>
<p><a name="IV.10" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.10" ><b class="bfseries">§10.</b></a></a>  <em>9.</em> When he lives in a monastery that is <em>famous </em>and renowned in the world, like Dakkhiṇagiri<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000538">
  <sup class="footnotemark">1</sup>
</a> Hatthikucchi, Cetiyagiri or Cittalapabbata, there are always people coming who want to pay homage to him, supposing that he is an Arahant, which inconveniences him. But if it suits him, he can live there at night and go elsewhere by day. </p>
<p><a name="IV.11" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.11" ><b class="bfseries">§11.</b></a></a>  <em>10.</em> In one with a <em>nearby city </em>objects of the opposite sex come into focus. Women-pot carriers go by bumping into him with their jars and giving no room <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{173|115}</small></span>to pass. Also important people spread out carpets in the middle of the monastery and sit down. </p>
<p><a name="IV.12" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.12" ><b class="bfseries">§12.</b></a></a>  <em>11.</em> One with <em>nearby timber trees</em> where there are timber trees and osiers useful for making framework is inconvenient because of the wood-gatherers there, like the gatherers of branches and fruits already mentioned. If there are trees in a monastery, people come and cut them down to build houses with. When he has come out of his meditation room in the evening and is walking up and down in the monastery, if he sees them and asks, “Why do you do so, lay followers?” they abuse him as they please and even try to evict him. </p>
<p><a name="IV.13" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.13" ><b class="bfseries">§13.</b></a></a>  <em>12.</em> People make use of one with <em>nearby arable fields</em>, quite surrounded by fields. They make a threshing floor in the middle of the monastery itself. They thresh corn there, dry it in the forecourts,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000539">
  <sup class="footnotemark">2</sup>
</a> and cause great inconvenience. And where there is extensive property belonging to the Community, the monastery attendants impound cattle belonging to families and deny the water supply [to their crops]. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[121]</i></span> Then people bring an ear of paddy and show it to the Community saying “Look at your monastery attendants’ work.” For one reason or another he has to go to the portals of the king or the king’s ministers. This [matter of property belonging to the Community] is included by [a monastery that is] near arable fields. </p>
<p><a name="IV.14" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.14" ><b class="bfseries">§14.</b></a></a>  <em>13. Presence of incompatible persons</em>: where there are bhikkhus living who are incompatible and mutually hostile, when they clash and it is protested, “Venerable sirs, do not do so,” they exclaim, “We no longer count now that this refuse-rag wearer has come.” 15. </p>
<p><a name="IV.15" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.15" ><b class="bfseries">§15.</b></a></a>  <em>14.</em> One with a nearby water <em>port of entry</em> or land port of entry<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000540">
  <sup class="footnotemark">3</sup>
</a> is made inconvenient by people constantly arriving respectively by ship or by caravan and crowding round, asking for space or for drinking water or salt. </p>
<p><a name="IV.16" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  <em>15.</em> In the case of one <em>near the border countries</em>, people have no trust in the Buddha, etc., there. </p>
<p><em>16.</em> In one <em>near the frontier of a kingdom</em> there is fear of kings. For perhaps one king attacks that place, thinking, “It does not submit to my rule,” and the other does likewise, thinking, “It does not submit to my rule.” A bhikkhu lives there when it is conquered by one king and when it is conquered by the other. Then they suspect him of spying, and they bring about his undoing. </p>
<p><a name="IV.17" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.17" ><b class="bfseries">§17.</b></a></a>  <em>17. Unsuitability</em> is that due to the risk of encountering visible data, etc., of the opposite sex as objects or to haunting by non-human beings. Here is a story. An elder lived in a forest, it seems. Then an ogress stood in the door of his leaf hut and sang. The elder came out and stood in the door. She went to the end of the walk and sang. The elder went to the end of the walk. She stood in a chasm a hundred fathoms deep and sang. The elder recoiled. Then she suddenly <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{174|116}</small></span>grabbed him saying, “Venerable sir, it is not just one or two of the likes of you I have eaten.” </p>
<p><a name="IV.18" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.18" ><b class="bfseries">§18.</b></a></a>  <em>18. Lack of good friends</em>: where it is not possible to find a good friend as a teacher or the equivalent of a teacher or a preceptor or the equivalent of a preceptor, the lack of good friends there is a serious fault. </p>
<p>One that has any of those eighteen faults should be understood as unfavourable. And this is said in the commentaries: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> A large abode, a new abode,<br /> One tumbling down, one near a road,<br /> One with a pond, or leaves, or flowers,<br /> Or fruits, or one that people seek; <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[122]</i></span> </blockquote>
<blockquote class="verse"> In cities, among timber, fields,<br /> Where people quarrel, in a port,<br /> In border lands, on frontiers,<br /> Unsuitableness, and no good friend— </blockquote>
<blockquote class="verse"> These are the eighteen instances<br /> A wise man needs to recognize<br /> And give them full as wide a berth<br /> As any footpad-hunted road. </blockquote>
<h1 id="a0000000109">2 The five factors of the resting place</h1>
<p><a name="IV.19" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.19" ><b class="bfseries">§19.</b></a></a>  One that has the five factors beginning with “not too far from and not too near to” the alms resort is called favourable. For this is said by the Blessed One: “And how has a lodging five factors, bhikkhus? Here, bhikkhus, (1) a lodging is not too far, not too near, and has a path for going and coming. (2) It is little frequented by day with little sound and few voices by night. (3) There is little contact with gadflies, flies, wind, burning [sun] and creeping things. (4) One who lives in that lodging easily obtains robes, alms food, lodging, and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick. (5) In that lodging there are elder bhikkhus living who are learned, versed in the scriptures, observers of the Dhamma, observers of the Vinaya, observers of the Codes, and when from time to time one asks them questions, ‘How is this, venerable sir? What is the meaning of this?’ then those venerable ones reveal the unrevealed, explain the unexplained, and remove doubt about the many things that raise doubts. This, bhikkhus, is how a lodging has five factors”(<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>V 15</b>). </p>
<p>These are the details for the clause, “After that he should avoid a monastery unfavourable to the development of concentration and go to live in one that is favourable” (<a href="ch-09.html#III.28" >III.28</a>). </p>
<h1 id="a0000000110">3 The lesser impediments</h1>
<p><a name="IV.20" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.20" ><b class="bfseries">§20.</b></a></a>  <em>Then he should sever the lesser impediments</em> (<a href="ch-09.html#III.28" >III.28</a>): one living in such a favourable monastery should sever any minor impediments that he may still have, that is to say, long head hair, nails, and body hair should be cut, mending and patching of old robes should be done, or those that are soiled should be <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{175|117}</small></span>dyed. If there is a stain on the bowl, the bowl should be baked. The bed, chair, etc., should be cleaned up. These are the details for the clause, “Then he should sever the lesser impediments.” </p>
<h1 id="a0000000111">4 Detailed instructions for development</h1>
<p><a name="IV.21" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.21" ><b class="bfseries">§21.</b></a></a>  Now, with the clause, <em>And not overlook any of the directions for development </em>(<a href="ch-09.html#III.28" >III.28</a>), the time has come for the detailed exposition of all meditation subjects, starting with the earth kasiṇa. </p>
<h1 id="a0000000112">5 The earth kasiṇa</h1>
<p><a name="IV.22" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.22" ><b class="bfseries">§22.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[123]</i></span> When a bhikkhu has thus severed the lesser impediments, then, on his return from his alms round after his meal and after he has got rid of drowsiness due to the meal, he should sit down comfortably in a secluded place and apprehend the sign in earth that is either made up or not made up. For this is said:<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000541">
  <sup class="footnotemark">4</sup>
</a> “One who is learning the earth kasiṇa apprehends the sign in earth that is either made up or not made up; that is bounded, not unbounded; limited, not unlimited; with a periphery, not without a periphery; circumscribed, not uncircumscribed; either the size of a bushel (<em>suppa</em>) or the size of a saucer (<em>sarāva</em>). He sees to it that that sign is well apprehended, well attended to, well defined. Having done that, and seeing its advantages and perceiving it as a treasure, building up respect for it, making it dear to him, he anchors his mind to that object, thinking, ‘Surely in this way I shall be freed from aging and death.’ Secluded from sense desires … he enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna …” </p>
<p><a name="IV.23" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.23" ><b class="bfseries">§23.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{176|118}</small></span>Herein, when in a previous becoming a man has gone forth into homelessness in the Dispensation or [outside it] with the rishis’ going forth and has already produced the jhāna tetrad or pentad on the earth kasiṇa, and so has such merit and the support [of past practice of jhāna] as well, then the sign arises in him on earth that is not made up, that is to say, on a ploughed area or on a threshing floor, as in the Elder Mallaka’s case. </p>
<p>It seems that while that venerable one was looking at a ploughed area the sign arose in him the size of that area. He extended it and attained the jhāna pentad. Then by establishing insight with the jhāna as the basis for it, he reached Arahantship. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000113">5.1 Making an earth kasiṇa</h2>
<p><a name="IV.24" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.24" ><b class="bfseries">§24.</b></a></a>  But when a man has had no such previous practice, he should make a kasiṇa, guarding against the four faults of a kasiṇa and not overlooking any of the directions for the meditation subject learnt from the teacher. Now, the four faults of the earth kasiṇa are due to the intrusion of blue, yellow, red or white. So instead of using clay of such colours, he should make the kasiṇa of clay like that in the stream of the Gangā,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000542">
  <sup class="footnotemark">5</sup>
</a> which is the colour of the dawn. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[124]</i></span> And he should make it not in the middle of the monastery in a place where novices, etc., are about but on the confines of the monastery in a screened place, either under an overhanging rock or in a leaf hut. He can make it either portable or as a fixture. </p>
<p><a name="IV.25" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.25" ><b class="bfseries">§25.</b></a></a>  Of these, a portable one should be made by tying rags of leather or matting onto four sticks and smearing thereon a disk of the size already mentioned, using clay picked clean of grass, roots, gravel, and sand, and well kneaded. At the time of the preliminary work it should be laid on the ground and looked at. </p>
<p>A fixture should be made by knocking stakes into the ground in the form of a lotus calyx, lacing them over with creepers. If the clay is insufficient, then other clay should be put underneath and a disk a span and four fingers across made on top of that with the quite pure dawn-coloured clay. For it was with reference only to measurement that it was said above <em>either the size of a bushel or the size of a saucer</em> (<a href="ch-10.html#IV.22" >§22</a>). But <em>that is bounded, not unbounded </em>was said to show its delimitedness. </p>
<p><a name="IV.26" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.26" ><b class="bfseries">§26.</b></a></a>  So, having thus made it delimited and of the size prescribed, he should scrape it down with a stone trowel—a wooden trowel turns it a bad colour, so that should not be employed—and make it as even as the surface of a drum. Then he should sweep the place out and have a bath. On his return he should seat himself on a well-covered chair with legs a span and four fingers high, prepared in a place that is two and a half cubits [that is, two and a half times elbow to finger-tip] from the kasiṇa disk. For the kasiṇa does not appear plainly to him if he sits further off than that; and if he sits nearer than that, faults in the <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{177|119}</small></span>kasiṇa appear. If he sits higher up, he has to look at it with his neck bent; and if he sits lower down, his knees ache. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000114">5.2 Starting contemplation</h2>
<p><a name="IV.27" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.27" ><b class="bfseries">§27.</b></a></a>  So, after seating himself in the way stated, he should review the dangers in sense desires in the way beginning, “Sense desires give little enjoyment” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#M" >M</a>
	]
</span>I 91</b>) and arouse longing for the escape from sense desires, for the renunciation that is the means to the surmounting of all suffering. He should next arouse joy of happiness by recollecting the special qualities of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha; then awe by thinking, “Now, this is the way of renunciation entered upon by all Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas and noble disciples”; and then eagerness by thinking, “In this way I shall surely come to know the taste of the bliss of seclusion.” <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[125]</i></span> After that he should open his eyes moderately, apprehend the sign, and so proceed to develop it.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000543">

</a> </p>
<p><a name="IV.28" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.28" ><b class="bfseries">§28.</b></a></a>  If he opens his eyes too wide, they get fatigued and the disk becomes too obvious, which prevents the sign becoming apparent to him. If he opens them too little, the disk is not obvious enough, and his mind becomes drowsy, which also prevents the sign becoming apparent to him. So he should develop it by apprehending the sign (<em>nimitta</em>), keeping his eyes open moderately, as if he were seeing the reflection of his face (<em>mukha-nimitta</em>) on the surface of a looking-glass.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000544">
  <sup class="footnotemark">7</sup>
</a> </p>
<p><a name="IV.29" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.29" ><b class="bfseries">§29.</b></a></a>  The colour should not be reviewed. The characteristic should not be given attention.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000545">
  <sup class="footnotemark">8</sup>
</a> But rather, while not ignoring the colour, attention should be given <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{178|120}</small></span>by setting the mind on the [name] concept as the most outstanding mental datum, relegating the colour to the position of a property of its physical support. That [conceptual state] can be called by anyone he likes among the names for earth (<em>pathavī</em>) such as “earth” (<em>pathavī</em>), “the Great One” (<em>mahī</em>), “the Friendly One” (<em>medinī</em>), “ground” (<em>bhūmi</em>), “the Provider of Wealth” (<em>vasudhā</em>), “the Bearer of Wealth” (<em>vasudharā</em>), etc., whichever suits his manner of perception. Still “earth” is also a name that is obvious, so it can be developed with the obvious one by saying “earth, earth.” It should be adverted to now with eyes open, now with eyes shut. And he should go on developing it in this way a hundred times, a thousand times, and even more than that, until the learning sign arises. </p>
<p><a name="IV.30" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.30" ><b class="bfseries">§30.</b></a></a>  When, while he is developing it in this way, it comes into focus<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000546">
  <sup class="footnotemark">9</sup>
</a> as he adverts with his eyes shut exactly as it does with his eyes open, then the learning sign is said to have been produced. After its production he should no longer sit in that place;<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000547">
  <sup class="footnotemark">10</sup>
</a><b class="bfseries"> </b>he should return to his own quarters and go on developing it sitting there. But in order to avoid the delay of foot washing, a pair of single-soled sandals and a walking stick are desirable. Then if the new concentration vanishes through some unsuitable encounter, he can put his sandals on, take his walking stick, and go back to the place to re-apprehend the sign there. When he returns he should seat himself comfortably and develop it by reiterated reaction to it and by striking at it with thought and applied thought. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000115">5.3 The counterpart sign</h2>
<p><a name="IV.31" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.31" ><b class="bfseries">§31.</b></a></a>  As he does so, the hindrances eventually become suppressed, the defilements subside, the mind becomes concentrated with access concentration, and the counterpart sign arises. </p>
<p>The difference between the earlier learning sign and the counterpart sign is this. In the learning sign any fault in the kasiṇa is apparent. But the counterpart sign <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[126]</i></span> appears as if breaking out from the learning sign, and a hundred times, a thousand times more purified, like a looking-glass disk drawn from its case, like a mother-of-pearl dish well washed, like the moon’s disk coming out from behind a cloud, like cranes against a thunder cloud. But it has neither colour nor shape; for if it had, it would be cognizable by the eye, gross, susceptible of comprehension [by insight—(see <a href="ch-27.html#XX.2" >XX.2f.</a>)] and stamped with the three characteristics.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000548">

<p><a name="IV.32" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.32" ><b class="bfseries">§32.</b></a></a>  Now, concentration is of two kinds, that is to say, access concentration and absorption concentration: the mind becomes concentrated in two ways, that is, on the plane of access and on the plane of obtainment. Herein, the mind becomes concentrated on the plane of access by the abandonment of the hindrances, and on the plane of obtainment by the manifestation of the jhāna factors. </p>
<p><a name="IV.33" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.33" ><b class="bfseries">§33.</b></a></a>  The difference between the two kinds of concentration is this. The factors are not strong in access.

</a> just as when a young child is lifted up and stood on its feet, it <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{180|122}</small></span>repeatedly falls down on the ground. But the factors are strong in absorption. It is because they are strong that when absorption concentration has arisen, the mind, having once interrupted the flow of the life-continuum, carries on with a stream of profitable impulsion for a whole night and for a whole day, just as a healthy man, after rising from his seat, could stand for a whole day. </p>

That is suitable in which the sign arises and becomes confirmed, in which mindfulness becomes established and the mind becomes concentrated, as in the Elder Padhāniya-Tissa, resident at Nāgapabbata. So if a monastery has many abodes he can try them one by one, living in each for three days, and stay on where his mind becomes unified. For it was due to suitability of abode that five hundred bhikkhus reached Arahantship while still dwelling in the Lesser Nāga Cave (<em>Cūḷa-nāga-leṇa</em>) in Tambapaṇṇi Island (Sri Lanka) after apprehending their meditation subject there. There is no counting the stream-enterers who have reached Arahantship there after reaching the noble plane elsewhere; so too in the monastery of Cittalapabbata, and others. </p>

<h1 id="a0000000118">8 The ten kinds of skill in absorption</h1>
<p><a name="IV.42" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.42" ><b class="bfseries">§42.</b></a></a>  However, if this does not happen while he is practicing in this way, then he should have recourse to the ten kinds of skill in absorption. Here is the method. Skill in absorption needs [to be dealt with in] ten aspects: (1) making the basis clean, (2) maintaining balanced faculties, (3) skill in the sign, (4) he exerts the mind on an occasion when it should be exerted, (5) he restrains the mind on an occasion when it should be restrained, (6) he encourages the mind on an occasion when it should be encouraged, (7) he looks on at the mind with equanimity when it should be looked on at with equanimity, (8) avoidance of unconcentrated persons, (9) cultivation of concentrated persons, (10) resoluteness upon that (concentration). </p>
<p><a name="IV.43" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.43" ><b class="bfseries">§43.</b></a></a>  <em>1. </em>Herein, <em>making the basis clean</em> is cleansing the internal and the external basis. For when his head hair, nails and body hair are long, or when the body is soaked with sweat, then the internal basis is unclean and unpurified. But when an old dirty smelly robe is worn or when the lodging is dirty, then the external basis is unclean and unpurified. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[129]</i></span> When the internal and external bases are unclean, then the knowledge in the consciousness and consciousness-concomitants that arise is unpurified, like the light of a lamp’s flame that arises with an unpurified lamp-bowl, wick and oil as its support; formations do not become evident to one who tries to comprehend them with unpurified knowledge, and when he devotes himself to his meditation subject, it does not come to growth, increase and fulfilment. </p>
<p><a name="IV.44" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.44" ><b class="bfseries">§44.</b></a></a>  But when the internal and external bases are clean, then the knowledge in the consciousness and consciousness-concomitants that arise is clean and purified, like the light of a lamp’s flame that arises with a purified lamp bowl, wick and oil as its support; formations become evident to one who tries to comprehend them with purified knowledge, and as he devotes himself to his meditation subject, it comes to growth, increase and fulfilment. </p>
<p><a name="IV.45" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.45" ><b class="bfseries">§45.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{183|125}</small></span><em>2. Maintaining balanced faculties</em> is equalizing the [five] faculties of faith and the rest. For if his faith faculty is strong and the others weak, then the energy faculty cannot perform its function of exerting, the mindfulness faculty its function of establishing, the concentration faculty its function of not distracting, and the understanding faculty its function of seeing. So in that case the faith faculty should be modified either by reviewing the individual essences of the states [concerned, that is, the objects of attention] or by not giving [them] attention in the way in which the faith faculty became too strong. And this is illustrated by the story of the Elder Vakkali (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>III 119</b>). </p>
<p><a name="IV.46" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.46" ><b class="bfseries">§46.</b></a></a>  Then if the energy faculty is too strong, the faith faculty cannot perform its function of resolving, nor can the rest of the faculties perform their several functions. So in that case the energy faculty should be modified by developing tranquillity, and so on. And this should be illustrated by the story of the Elder Soṇa (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Vin" >Vin</a>
	]
</span>I 179–185</b>; <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#A" >A</a>
	]
</span>III 374–376</b>). So too with the rest; for it should be understood that when anyone of them is too strong the others cannot perform their several functions. </p>
<p><a name="IV.47" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.47" ><b class="bfseries">§47.</b></a></a>  However, what is particularly recommended is balancing faith with understanding, and concentration with energy. For one strong in faith and weak in understanding has confidence uncritically and groundlessly. One strong in understanding and weak in faith errs on the side of cunning and is as hard to cure as one sick of a disease caused by medicine. With the balancing of the two a man has confidence only when there are grounds for it. </p>
<p>Then idleness overpowers one strong in concentration and weak in energy, since concentration favours idleness. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[130]</i></span> Agitation overpowers one strong in energy and weak in concentration, since energy favours agitation. But concentration coupled with energy cannot lapse into idleness, and energy coupled with concentration cannot lapse into agitation. So these two should be balanced; for absorption comes with the balancing of the two. </p>
<p><a name="IV.48" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.48" ><b class="bfseries">§48.</b></a></a>  Again, [concentration and faith should be balanced]. One working on concentration needs strong faith, since it is with such faith and confidence that he reaches absorption. Then there is [balancing of] concentration and understanding. One working on concentration needs strong unification, since that is how he reaches absorption; and one working on insight needs strong understanding, since that is how he reaches penetration of characteristics; but with the balancing of the two he reaches absorption as well. </p>
<p><a name="IV.49" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.49" ><b class="bfseries">§49.</b></a></a>  Strong mindfulness, however, is needed in all instances; for mindfulness protects the mind from lapsing into agitation through faith, energy and understanding, which favour agitation, and from lapsing into idleness through concentration, which favours idleness. So it is as desirable in all instances as a seasoning of salt in all sauces, as a prime minister in all the king’s business. Hence it is said [in the commentaries (D-a 788, <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

When his mind is slack with over-laxness of energy, etc., then, instead of developing the three enlightenment factors beginning with tranquillity, he should develop those beginning with investigation-of-states. For this is said by the Blessed One: “Bhikkhus, suppose a man wanted to make a small fire burn up, and he put wet grass on it, put wet cow-dung on it, put wet sticks on it, sprinkled it with water, and scattered dust on it, would that man be able to make the small fire burn up?” <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[131]</i></span>—“No, venerable sir.”—“So too, bhikkhus, when the mind is slack, that is not the time to develop the tranquillity enlightenment factor, the concentration enlightenment factor or the equanimity enlightenment factor.

<p>“Bhikkhus, suppose a man wanted to make a small fire burn up, and he put dry grass on it, put dry cow-dung on it, put dry sticks on it, blew on it with his mouth, and did not scatter dust on it, would that man be able to make that small fire burn up?”—“Yes, venerable sir” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p>When a too clever bee learns that a flower on a tree is blooming, it sets out hurriedly, overshoots the mark, turns back, and arrives when the pollen is finished; and another, not clever enough bee, who sets out with too slow a speed, arrives when the pollen is finished too; but a clever bee sets out with balanced speed, arrives with ease at the cluster of flowers, takes as much pollen as it pleases and enjoys the honey-dew. </p>

<p><a name="IV.69" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.69" ><b class="bfseries">§69.</b></a></a>  Again when the king announces, “Anyone who can draw out a spider’s thread four fathoms long shall receive four thousand,” one man who is too clever breaks the spider’s thread here and there by pulling it hurriedly, and another who is not clever enough does not dare to touch it with his hand for fear of breaking it, but a clever man pulls it out starting from the end with a balanced effort, winds it on a stick, and so wins the prize. </p>
<p><a name="IV.70" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.70" ><b class="bfseries">§70.</b></a></a>  Again, a too clever <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[137]</i></span> skipper hoists full sails in a high wind and sends his ship adrift, and another, not clever enough skipper, lowers his sails in a light wind and remains where he is, but a clever skipper hoists full sails in a light wind, takes in half his sails in a high wind, and so arrives safely at his desired destination. </p>
<p><a name="IV.71" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.71" ><b class="bfseries">§71.</b></a></a>  Again, when a teacher says, “Anyone who fills the oil-tube without spilling any oil will win a prize,” one who is too clever fills it hurriedly out of greed for the prize, and he spills the oil, and another who is not clever enough does not dare to pour the oil at all for fear of spilling it, but one who is clever fills it with a balanced effort and wins the prize. </p>

Another who sees the defect in over-exertion slacks off his energy, thinking, “What is absorption to me now?” Then his mind lapses into idleness because of his mind’s too lax energy and he too is prevented from reaching absorption. Yet another who frees his mind from idleness even when it is only slightly idle and from agitation when only slightly agitated, confronting the sign with balanced effort, reaches absorption. One should be like the last-named. </p>

The rest are of the sense sphere, but they have stronger applied thought, sustained thought, happiness, bliss, and unification of mind than the normal ones.

For it is only either the fourth or the fifth that fixes in absorption. And that is according as there is swift or sluggish direct-knowledge.

</a> that there is absorption. Beyond that, impulsion lapses. It is said to do so because of nearness of the life-continuum.” And that has been stated in this way after consideration, so it cannot be rejected. For just as a man who is running towards a precipice and wants to stop cannot do so when he has his foot on the edge but falls over it, so there can be no fixing in absorption in the sixth or the seventh because of the nearness to the life-continuum. That is why it should be understood that there is absorption only in the fourth or the fifth. </p>

Then the life-continuum is interrupted by adverting for the purpose of reviewing the jhāna, next to which comes the reviewing of the jhāna. </p>

<p><a name="IV.80" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.80" ><b class="bfseries">§80.</b></a></a>  Herein, <em>quite secluded from sense desires</em> means having secluded himself from, having become without, having gone away from, sense desires. Now, this word <em>quite </em>(<em>eva</em>) should be understood to have the meaning of absoluteness. Precisely because it has the meaning of absoluteness it shows how, on the actual occasion of entering upon and dwelling in the first jhāna, sense desires as well as being non-existent then are the first jhāna’s contrary opposite, and it also shows that the arrival takes place only (<em>eva</em>) through the letting go of sense desires. How? </p>
<p><a name="IV.81" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.81" ><b class="bfseries">§81.</b></a></a>  When absoluteness is introduced thus, “quite secluded from sense desires,” what is expressed is this: sense desires are certainly incompatible with this jhāna; when they exist, it does not occur, just as when there is darkness, there is no lamplight; and it is only by letting go of them that it is reached, just as the further bank is reached only by letting go of the near bank. That is why absoluteness is introduced. </p>
<p><a name="IV.82" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.82" ><b class="bfseries">§82.</b></a></a>  Here it might be asked: But why is this [word “quite”] mentioned only in the first phrase and not in the second? How is this, might he enter upon and <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{192|134}</small></span>dwell in the first jhāna even when not secluded from unprofitable things?—It should not be regarded in that way. It is mentioned in the first phrase as the escape from them; for this jhāna is the escape from sense desires since it surmounts the sense-desire element and since it is incompatible with greed for sense desires, according as it is said: “The escape from sense desires is this, that is to say, renunciation” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	<a href="ch-03.html#D" >D</a>

</span>III 275</b>). But in the second phrase <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[140]</i></span> the word <em>eva </em>should be adduced and taken as said, as in the passage, “Bhikkhus, only (<em>eva</em>) here is there an ascetic, here a second ascetic” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#M" >M</a>
	]
</span>I 63</b>). For it is impossible to enter upon and dwell in jhāna unsecluded also from unprofitable things, in other words, the hindrances other than that [sense desire]. So this word must be read in both phrases thus: “Quite secluded from sense desires, quite secluded from unprofitable things.” And although the word “secluded” as a general term includes all kinds of seclusion, that is to say, seclusion by substitution of opposites, etc., and bodily seclusion, etc.,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000560">
  <sup class="footnotemark">23</sup>

<p><a name="IV.83" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.83" ><b class="bfseries">§83.</b></a></a>  But this term “sense desires” should be regarded as including all kinds, that is to say, sense desires as object as given in the Niddesa in the passage beginning, “What are sense desires as object? They are agreeable visible objects …” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Nidd" >Nidd</a>

That being so, the words “quite secluded from sense desires” properly mean “quite secluded from sense desires as object,” and express bodily seclusion, while the words “secluded from unprofitable things” properly mean “secluded from sense desires as defilement or from all unprofitable things,” and express mental seclusion. And in this case giving up of pleasure in sense desires is indicated by the first since it only expresses seclusion from sense desires as object, while acquisition of pleasure <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{193|135}</small></span>in renunciation is indicated by the second since it expresses seclusion from sense desire as defilement. </p>
<p><a name="IV.84" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.84" ><b class="bfseries">§84.</b></a></a>  And with sense desires as object and sense desires as defilement expressed in this way, it should also be recognized that the abandoning of the objective basis for defilement is indicated by the first of these two phrases and the abandoning of the [subjective] defilement by the second; also that the giving up of the cause of cupidity is indicated by the first and [the giving up of the cause] of stupidity by the second; also that the purification of one’s occupation is indicated by the first and the educating of one’s inclination by the second. </p>
<p>This, firstly, is the method here when the words <em>from sense desires </em>are treated as referring to sense desires as object. </p>
<p><a name="IV.85" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.85" ><b class="bfseries">§85.</b></a></a>  But if they are treated as referring to sense desires as defilement, then it is simply just zeal for sense desires (<em>kāmacchanda</em>) in the various forms of zeal (<em>chanda</em>), greed (<em>rāga</em>), etc., that is intended as “sense desires” (<em>kāma</em>) (<a href="ch-10.html#IV.83" >§83</a>, 2nd quotation). <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[141]</i></span> And although that [lust] is also included by [the word] “unprofitable,” it is nevertheless stated separately in the Vibhaṅga in the way beginning, “Herein, what are sense desires? Zeal as sense desire …” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Vibh" >Vibh</a>
	]
</span>256</b>) because of its incompatibility with jhāna. Or, alternatively, it is mentioned in the first phrase because it is sense desire as defilement and in the second phrase because it is included in the “unprofitable.” And because this [lust] has various forms, therefore “from sense desires” is said instead of “from sense desire.” </p>
<p><a name="IV.86" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.86" ><b class="bfseries">§86.</b></a></a>  And although there may be unprofitableness in other states as well, nevertheless only the hindrances are mentioned subsequently in the Vibhaṅga thus, “Herein, what states are unprofitable? Lust …” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Vibh" >Vibh</a>
	]
</span>256</b>), etc., in order to show their opposition to, and incompatibility with, the jhāna factors. For the hindrances are the contrary opposites of the jhāna factors: what is meant is that the jhāna factors are incompatible with them, eliminate them, abolish them. And it is said accordingly in the <em>Peṭaka</em> (<em>Peṭakopadesa</em>): “Concentration is incompatible with lust, happiness with ill will, applied thought with stiffness and torpor, bliss with agitation and worry, and sustained thought with uncertainty” (not in <em>Peṭakopadesa</em>). </p>
<p><a name="IV.87" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.87" ><b class="bfseries">§87.</b></a></a>  So in this case it should be understood that seclusion by suppression (suspension) of lust is indicated by the phrase quite secluded from sense desires, and seclusion by suppression (suspension) of [all] five hindrances by the phrase secluded from unprofitable things. But omitting repetitions, that of lust is indicated by the first and that of the remaining hindrances by the second. Similarly with the three unprofitable roots, that of greed, which has the five cords of sense desire (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

Or with the states consisting of the floods, etc., that of the flood of sense desires, of the bond of sense desires, of the canker of sense desires, of sense-desire clinging, of the bodily tie of <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{194|136}</small></span>covetousness, and of the fetter of greed for sense desires, is indicated by the first, and that of the remaining floods, bonds, cankers, clingings, ties, and fetters, is indicated by the second. Again, that of craving and of what is associated with craving is indicated by the first, and that of ignorance and of what is associated with ignorance is indicated by the second. Furthermore, that of the eight thought-arisings associated with greed (<a href="ch-21.html#XIV.90" >XIV.90</a>) is indicated by the first, and that of the remaining kinds of unprofitable thought-arisings is indicated by the second. </p>
<p>This, in the first place, is the explanation of the meaning of the words “quite secluded from sense desires, secluded from unprofitable things.” </p>
<p><a name="IV.88" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.88" ><b class="bfseries">§88.</b></a></a>  So far the factors abandoned by the jhāna have been shown. And now, in order to show the factors associated with it, <em>which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought</em> is said. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[142]</i></span> Herein, applied thinking (<em>vitakkana</em>) is <em>applied thought </em>(<em>vitakka</em>); hitting upon, is what is meant.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000562">

</a> It has the characteristic of directing the mind on to an object (mounting the mind on its object). Its function is to strike at and thresh—for the meditator is said, in virtue of it, to have the object struck at by applied thought, threshed by applied thought. It is manifested as the leading of the mind onto an object. Sustained thinking (<em>vicaraṇa</em>) is <em>sustained thought </em>(<em>vicāra</em>); continued sustainment (<em>anusañcaraṇa</em>), is what is meant. It has the characteristic of continued pressure on (occupation with) the object. Its function is to keep conascent [mental] states [occupied] with that. It is manifested as keeping consciousness anchored [on that object]. </p>
<p><a name="IV.89" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.89" ><b class="bfseries">§89.</b></a></a>  And, though sometimes not separate, <em>applied thought </em>is the first impact of the mind in the sense that it is both gross and inceptive, like the striking of a bell. <em>Sustained thought </em>is the act of keeping the mind anchored, in the sense that it is subtle with the individual essence of continued pressure, like the ringing of the bell. <em>Applied thought </em>intervenes, being the interference of consciousness at the time of first arousing [thought], like a bird’s spreading out its wings when about to soar into the air, and like a bee’s diving towards a lotus when it is minded to follow up the scent of it. The behaviour of <em>sustained thought </em>is quiet, being the near non-interference of consciousness, like the bird’s planing with outspread wings after soaring into the air, and like the bee’s buzzing above the lotus after it has dived towards it. </p>
<p><a name="IV.90" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.90" ><b class="bfseries">§90.</b></a></a>  In the commentary to the Book of Twos<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000563">

</a> this is said: “Applied thought occurs as a state of directing the mind onto an object, like the movement of a large bird taking off into the air by engaging the air with both wings and forcing them downwards. For it causes absorption by being unified. Sustained thought occurs with the individual essence of continued pressure, like the bird’s movement when it is using (activating) its wings for the purpose of keeping <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{195|137}</small></span>hold on the air. For it keeps pressing the object<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000564">
  <sup class="footnotemark">27</sup>
</a>”. That fits in with the latter’s occurrence as anchoring. This difference of theirs becomes evident in the first and second jhānas [in the fivefold reckoning]. </p>
<p><a name="IV.91" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.91" ><b class="bfseries">§91.</b></a></a>  Furthermore, <em>applied thought </em>is like the hand that grips firmly and <em>sustained thought </em>is like the hand that rubs, when one grips a tarnished metal dish firmly with one hand and rubs it with powder and oil and a woollen pad with the other hand. Likewise, when a potter has spun his wheel with a stroke on the stick and is making a dish <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[143]</i></span>, his supporting hand is like <em>applied thought </em>and his hand that moves back and forth is like <em>sustained thought</em>.

Seeing the moonlight, he faced in the direction of the Great Shrine [at Anurādhapura], thinking, “At this very hour the four <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{196|138}</small></span>assemblies<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000566">

</a> are worshipping at the Great Shrine!” By means of objects formerly seen [there] he aroused uplifting happiness with the Enlightened One as object, and he rose into the air like a painted ball bounced off a plastered floor and alighted on the terrace of the Great Shrine. </p>
<p><a name="IV.96" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.96" ><b class="bfseries">§96.</b></a></a>  And this was what happened to the daughter of a clan in the village of Vattakālaka near the Girikaṇḍaka Monastery when she sprang up into the air owing to strong uplifting happiness with the Enlightened One as object. As her parents were about to go to the monastery in the evening, it seems, in order to hear the Dhamma <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[144]</i></span>, they told her: “My dear, you are expecting a child; you cannot go out at an unsuitable time. We shall hear the Dhamma and gain merit for you.” So they went out. And though she wanted to go too, she could not well object to what they said. She stepped out of the house onto a balcony and stood looking at the Ākāsacetiya Shrine at Girikaṇḍaka lit by the moon. She saw the offering of lamps at the shrine, and the four communities as they circumambulated it to the right after making their offerings of flowers and perfumes; and she heard the sound of the massed recital by the Community of Bhikkhus. Then she thought: “How lucky they are to be able to go to the monastery and wander round such a shrine terrace and listen to such sweet preaching of Dhamma!” Seeing the shrine as a mound of pearls and arousing uplifting happiness, she sprang up into the air, and before her parents arrived she came down from the air into the shrine terrace, where she paid homage and stood listening to the Dhamma. </p>
<p><a name="IV.97" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.97" ><b class="bfseries">§97.</b></a></a>  When her parents arrived, they asked her, “What road did you come by?” She said, “I came through the air, not by the road,” and when they told her, “My dear, those whose cankers are destroyed come through the air. But how did you come?” she replied: “As I was standing looking at the shrine in the moonlight a strong sense of happiness arose in me with the Enlightened One as its object. Then I knew no more whether I was standing or sitting, but only that I was springing up into the air with the sign that I had grasped, and I came to rest on this shrine terrace.” </p>
<p>So uplifting happiness can be powerful enough to levitate the body, make it spring up into the air. </p>

<p>Of these, what is intended in this context by happiness is pervading happiness, which is the root of absorption and comes by growth into association with absorption. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[145]</i></span> </p>

<p>And wherever the two are associated, happiness is the contentedness at getting a desirable object, and bliss is the actual experiencing of it when got. Where there is happiness there is bliss (pleasure); but where there is bliss there is not necessarily happiness. Happiness is included in the formations aggregate; bliss is included in the feeling aggregate. If a man, exhausted<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000568">

Or alternatively: (b) the words <em>happiness and bliss </em>(<em>pītisukhaṃ</em>) can be taken as “the happiness and the bliss” independently, like “the Dhamma and the Discipline” (<em>dhammavinaya</em>), and so then it can be taken as seclusion-born happiness-and-bliss of this jhāna, or in this jhāna; so in this way it is the happiness and bliss [rather than the jhāna] that are born of seclusion. For just as the words “born of seclusion” can [as at (a)] be taken as qualifying the word “jhāna,” so too they can be taken here [as at (b)] as qualifying the expression “happiness and bliss,” and then that [total expression] is predicated of this [jhāna].

Herein, the abandoning of the five factors should be understood as the abandoning of these five hindrances, namely, lust, ill will, stiffness and torpor, agitation and worry, and uncertainty; for no jhāna arises until these have been abandoned, and so they are called the factors of abandoning. For although other unprofitable things too are abandoned at the moment of jhāna, still only these are specifically obstructive to jhāna. </p>
<p><a name="IV.105" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.105" ><b class="bfseries">§105.</b></a></a>  The mind affected through lust by greed for varied objective fields does not become concentrated on an object consisting in unity, or being overwhelmed by lust, it does not enter on the way to abandoning the sense-desire element. When pestered by ill will towards an object, it does not occur uninterruptedly. When overcome by stiffness and torpor, it is unwieldy. When seized by agitation and worry, it is unquiet and buzzes about. When stricken by uncertainty, it fails to mount the way to accomplish the attainment of jhāna. So it is these only that are called factors of abandoning because they are specifically obstructive to jhāna. </p>
<p><a name="IV.106" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.106" ><b class="bfseries">§106.</b></a></a>  But applied thought directs the mind onto the object; sustained thought keeps it anchored there. Happiness produced by the success of the effort refreshes the mind whose effort has succeeded through not being distracted by those hindrances; and bliss intensifies it for the same reason. Then unification aided by this directing onto, this anchoring, this refreshing and this intensifying, evenly and rightly centres (<a href="ch-09.html#III.3" >III.3</a>) the mind with its remaining associated states on the object consisting in unity. Consequently, possession of five factors should be understood as the arising of these five, namely, applied thought, sustained thought, happiness, bliss and unification of mind. </p>

How? </p>
<p><a name="IV.115" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.115" ><b class="bfseries">§115.</b></a></a>  Firstly, in a cycle [of consciousness] in which absorption arises the mind becomes purified from the group of defilements called hindrances that are an obstruction to jhāna. Being devoid of obstruction because it has been purified, it makes way for the central [state of equilibrium, which is the] sign of serenity. Now, it is the absorption concentration itself occurring evenly that is called <em>the sign of serenity</em>. But the consciousness immediately before that <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[149]</i></span> reaches that state by way of change in a single continuity (cf. <a href="ch-29.html#XXII.1" >XXII.1</a>–<a href="ch-29.html#XXII.6" >6</a>), and so it is said that it <em>makes way for the central [state of equilibrium, which is the] sign of serenity</em>. And it is said that it <em>enters into that state</em> by approaching it through having made way for it. That is why in the first place <em>purification of the way</em>, while referring to aspects existing in the preceding consciousness, should nevertheless be understood as the approach at the moment of the first jhāna’s actual arising. </p>
<p><a name="IV.116" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.116" ><b class="bfseries">§116.</b></a></a>  Secondly, when he has more interest in purifying, since there is no need to re-purify what has already been purified thus, it is said that <em>he looks on with equanimity at the mind that is purified</em>. And when he has no more interest in concentrating again what has already made way for serenity by arriving at the state of serenity, it is said that <em>he looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for serenity</em>. And when he has no more interest in again causing appearance of unity in what has already appeared as unity through abandonment of its association with defilement in making way for serenity, it is said that <em>he looks on with equanimity at the appearance of unity</em>. That is why <em>intensification of equanimity </em>should be understood as the function of equanimity that consists in specific neutrality. </p>
<p><a name="IV.117" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.117" ><b class="bfseries">§117.</b></a></a>  And lastly, when equanimity was thus intensified, the states called concentration and understanding produced there, occurred coupled together without either one exceeding the other. And also the [five] faculties beginning with faith occurred with the single function (taste) of deliverance owing to deliverance from the various defilements. And also the energy appropriate to that, which was favourable to their state of non-excess and single function, was <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{201|143}</small></span>effective. And also its repetition occurs at that moment.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000571">
  <sup class="footnotemark">34</sup>
</a> Now, all these [four] aspects are only produced because it is after seeing with knowledge the various dangers in defilement and advantages in cleansing that satisfiedness, purifiedness and clarifiedness ensue accordingly. That is the reason why it was said that <em>satisfaction </em>should be understood as the manifestation of clarifying knowledge’s function in accomplishing non-excess, etc., of states (<a href="ch-10.html#IV.114" >§114</a>). </p>
<p><a name="IV.118" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.118" ><b class="bfseries">§118.</b></a></a>  Herein, satisfaction as a function of knowledge is called “the end” since the knowledge is evident as due to onlooking equanimity, according as it is said: “He looks on with complete equanimity at the mind thus exerted; then the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to equanimity. Owing to equanimity the mind is liberated from the many sorts of defilements; then the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to liberation.

<p>In order to perfect the development of consciousness he should besides extend the counterpart sign according as acquired.

He should not, in fact, extend it without having delimited [the amount it is to be extended by]. After that has been done, he can further extend it, doing so by delimiting successive boundaries of, say, a span, a <em>ratana </em>(=2 spans), the veranda, the surrounding space,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000575">

Or alternatively, that jhāna is stated to “have confidence” because it makes the mind confident with the confidence possessed by it and by stilling the disturbance created by applied and sustained thought. And with this conception of the meaning the word construction must be taken as “confidence of mind.” But with the first-mentioned conception of the meaning the words “of mind” must be construed with “singleness<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000579">

<p><a name="IV.143" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.143" ><b class="bfseries">§143.</b></a></a>  Here is the construction of the meaning in that case. Unique (<em>eka</em>) it comes up (<em>udeti</em>), thus it is single (<em>ekodi</em>); the meaning is, it comes up as the superlative, the best, because it is not overtopped by applied and sustained thought, for the best is called “unique” in the world. Or it is permissible to say that when deprived <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{207|149}</small></span>of applied and sustained thought it is unique, without companion. Or alternatively: it evokes (<em>udāyati</em>) associated states, thus it is an evoker (<em>udi</em>); the meaning is, it arouses. And that is unique (<em>eka</em>) in the sense of best, and it is an evoker (<em>udi</em>), thus it is a unique evoker (<em>ekodi </em>= single). This is a term for concentration. Then, since the second jhāna gives existingness to (<em>bhāveti</em>), augments, this single [thing], it “gives singleness” (<em>ekodibhāva</em>). But as this single [thing] is a mind’s, not a being’s or a soul’s, so singleness of mind is said. </p>
<p><a name="IV.144" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.144" ><b class="bfseries">§144.</b></a></a>  It might be asked: But does not this faith exist in the first jhāna too, and also this concentration with the name of the “single [thing]?” Then why is only this second jhāna said to have confidence and singleness of mind?—It may be replied as follows: It is because that first jhāna <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[157]</i></span> is not fully confident owing to the disturbance created by applied and sustained thought, like water ruffled by ripples and wavelets. That is why, although faith does exist in it, it is not called “confidence.” And there too concentration is not fully evident because of the lack of full confidence. That is why it is not called “singleness” there. But in this second jhāna faith is strong, having got a footing in the absence of the impediments of applied and sustained thought; and concentration is also evident through having strong faith as its companion. That may be understood as the reason why only this jhāna is described in this way. </p>
<p><a name="IV.145" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.145" ><b class="bfseries">§145.</b></a></a>  But that much is actually stated in the Vibhaṅga too with the words: “‘Confidence’ is faith, having faith, trust, full confidence. ‘Singleness of mind’ is steadiness of consciousness … right concentration” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="IV.146" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.146" ><b class="bfseries">§146.</b></a></a>  <em>Without applied thought, without sustained thought</em>: since it has been abandoned by development, there is no applied thought in this, or of this, [jhāna], thus it is without applied thought. The same explanation applies to sustained thought. Also it is said in the Vibhaṅga: “So this applied thought and this sustained thought are quieted, quietened, stilled, set at rest, set quite at rest, done away with, quite done away with,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000580">

<p>Here it may be asked: Has not this meaning already been established by the words “with the stilling of applied and sustained thought?” So why is it said again “without applied thought, without sustained thoughts?”—It may be replied: Yes, that meaning has already been established. But this does not indicate that meaning. Did we not say earlier: “The phrase ‘with the stilling of applied and sustained thought’ is expressed in this way in order to indicate that the act of attaining the other jhānas, beginning with that of the second from the first, is effected by the surmounting of the gross factor in each case?” (<a href="ch-10.html#IV.140" >§140</a>). </p>
<p><a name="IV.147" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.147" ><b class="bfseries">§147.</b></a></a>  Besides, this confidence comes about with the act of stilling, not the darkness of defilement, but the applied and sustained thought. And the <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{208|150}</small></span>singleness comes about, not as in access jhāna with the abandoning of the hindrances, nor as in the first jhāna with the manifestation of the factors, but with the act of stilling the applied and sustained thought. So that [first] clause indicates the cause of the confidence and singleness. In the same way this jhāna is without applied thought and without sustained thought, not as in the third and fourth jhānas or as in eye-consciousness, etc., with just absence, but with the actual act of stilling the applied and sustained thought. So that [first clause] also indicates the cause of the state without applied and sustained thought; it does not indicate the bare absence of applied and sustained thought. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[158]</i></span> The bare absence of applied and sustained thought is indicated by this [second] clause, namely, “without applied thought, without sustained thought.” Consequently it needs to be stated notwithstanding that the first has already been stated. </p>

Herein, although the first was born of associated concentration too, still it is only this concentration that is quite worthy to be called “concentration” because of its complete confidence and extreme immobility due to absence of disturbance by applied and sustained thought. So only this [jhāna] is called “born of concentration,” and that is in order to recommend it. </p>

Herein, the abandoning of two factors should be understood as the abandoning of applied thought and sustained thought. But while the hindrances are abandoned at the moment of the access of the first jhāna, in the case of this jhāna the applied thought and sustained thought are not abandoned at the moment of its access. It is only at the moment of actual absorption that the jhāna arises without them. Hence they are called its factors of abandoning. </p>
<p><a name="IV.150" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.150" ><b class="bfseries">§150.</b></a></a>  Its possession of three factors should be understood as the arising of the three, that is, happiness, bliss, and unification of mind.

<p><em>Equanimity of energy </em>and <em>equanimity as feeling </em>are different both from each other and from the rest. </p>

<p>Here it may be said: Is this not simply equanimity as specific neutrality in the meaning? And that exists in the first and second jhānas as well; so this clause, “He dwells in equanimity,” ought to be stated of those also. Why is it not?—[It may be replied:] Because its function is unevident there since it is overshadowed by applied thought and the rest. But it appears here with a quite evident function, with head erect, as it were, because it is not overshadowed by applied thought and sustained thought and happiness. That is why it is stated here. </p>

And besides, beings are greedy for bliss, and this kind of bliss is exceedingly sweet since there is none greater. But here there is non-greed for the bliss owing to the influence of the mindfulness and full awareness, not for any other reason. And so it should also be understood that it is stated only here in order to emphasize this meaning too. </p>

It is done so that they can be readily grasped. For the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling described here by the words “which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure” is subtle, hard to recognize and not readily grasped. So just as, when a cattle-herd<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000587">
  <sup class="footnotemark">50</sup>
</a> wants to catch a refractory ox that cannot be caught at all by approaching it, he collects all the cattle into one pen <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[167]</i></span> and lets them out one by one, and then [he says] “That is it; catch it,” and so it gets caught as well, so too the Blessed One has collected all these [five kinds of feeling] together so that they can be grasped readily; for when they are shown collected together in this way, then what is not [bodily] pleasure (bliss) or [bodily] pain or [mental] joy or [mental] grief can still be grasped in this way: “This is neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.” </p>
<p><a name="IV.191" ><a href="ch-10.html#IV.191" ><b class="bfseries">§191.</b></a></a>  Besides, this may be understood as said in order to show the condition for the neither-painful-nor-pleasant mind-deliverance. For the abandoning of [bodily] pain, etc., are conditions for that, according as it is said: “There are four conditions, friend, for the attainment of the neither-painful-nor-pleasant mind-deliverance. Here, friend, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells in the fourth jhāna … equanimity. These are the four conditions for the attainment of the neither-painful-nor-pleasant mind-deliverance” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

Or alternatively, they can be understood as mentioned for the purpose of showing that greed and hate are very far away owing to the removal of their conditions; for of these, pleasure (bliss) is a condition for joy, and joy for greed; pain is a condition for grief and grief for hate. So with the removal of pleasure (bliss), etc., greed and hate are very far away since they are removed along with their conditions. </p>

This third kind of feeling named neither-pain-nor-pleasure is also called “equanimity.” It has the characteristic of experiencing what is contrary to both the desirable and the undesirable. Its function is neutral. Its manifestation is unevident. Its proximate cause should be understood as the cessation of pleasure (bliss). </p>

Also it is said in the Vibhaṅga: “This mindfulness is cleared, purified, clarified, by equanimity; hence it is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

That is why no one among these [first three jhānas] is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. But here this crescent moon consisting in specific neutrality is utterly pure because it is not outshone by the glare of the opposing states consisting in applied thought, etc., and because it has the night of equanimity-as-feeling for its ally. And since it is purified, the conascent mindfulness and other states are purified and clear also, like the purified crescent moon’s radiance. That, it should be understood, is why only this jhāna is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. </p>
