It should be developed by one who has taken his stand on virtue that has been purified by means of the special qualities of fewness of wishes, etc., and perfected by observance of the ascetic practices. But that concentration has been shown only very briefly and so it is not even easy to understand, much less to develop. There is therefore the following set of questions, the purpose of which is to show the method of its development in detail: </p>
<p>(i) What is concentration? (ii) In what sense is it concentration? (iii) What are its characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause? </p>
<p>(iv) How many kinds of concentration are there? (v) What is its defilement? (vi) What is its cleansing? (vii) How should it be developed? (viii) What are the benefits of the development of concentration?<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000501">

<h1 id="a0000000090">1 (i) What is concentration?</h1>
<p>Concentration is of many sorts and has various aspects.

<p><em>2. </em>In the section dealing with that of two kinds, <em>access </em>concentration is the unification of mind obtained by the following, that is to say, the six recollections, mindfulness of death, the recollection of peace, the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, and the defining of the four elements, and it is the unification that precedes absorption concentration. <em>Absorption </em>concentration is the unification that follows immediately upon the preliminary-work (<a href="ch-10.html#IV.74" >IV.74</a>) because of the words, “The first-jhāna preliminary-work is a condition, as proximity condition, for the first jhāna” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="III.7" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.7" ><b class="bfseries">§7.</b></a></a>  <em>3. </em>In the second dyad <em>mundane </em>concentration is profitable unification of mind in the three planes. <em>Supramundane </em>concentration is the unification associated with the noble paths.

<p><a name="III.8" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.8" ><b class="bfseries">§8.</b></a></a>  <em>4. </em>In the third dyad concentration <em>with happiness </em>is the unification of mind in two jhānas in the fourfold reckoning and in three jhānas in the fivefold reckoning. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[86]</i></span> Concentration <em>without happiness </em>is the unification in the remaining two jhānas. But access concentration may be with happiness or without happiness. So it is of two kinds as with happiness and without happiness. </p>
<p><a name="III.9" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.9" ><b class="bfseries">§9.</b></a></a>  <em>5. </em>In the fourth dyad concentration <em>accompanied by bliss </em>is the unification in three jhānas in the fourfold and four in the fivefold reckoning.

<p><a name="III.10" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.10" ><b class="bfseries">§10.</b></a></a>  <em>6. </em>In the first of the triads what has only just been acquired is <em>inferior</em>.

For when a man sees danger only in applied thought and not in sustained thought, he aspires only to abandon applied thought when he passes beyond the first jhāna, and so he obtains concentration without applied thought and with sustained thought only. This is said with reference to him. Concentration<em> without applied thought and sustained thought </em>is the unification in the three jhānas beginning with the second in the fourfold reckoning and with the third in the fivefold reckoning (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="III.13" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.13" ><b class="bfseries">§13.</b></a></a>  <em>9. </em>In the fourth triad <em>limited </em>concentration is unification on the plane of access. <em>Exalted </em>concentration is unification in profitable [consciousness, etc.,] of the fine-material sphere and immaterial sphere. <em>Measureless </em>concentration is unification associated with the noble paths.

<p><a name="III.14" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.14" ><b class="bfseries">§14.</b></a></a>  <em>10. </em>In the first of the tetrads there is concentration of <em>difficult progress and sluggish direct-knowledge</em>. There is that of difficult progress and swift direct-knowledge. There is that of easy progress and sluggish direct-knowledge. And there is that of easy progress and swift direct-knowledge. </p>
<p><a name="III.15" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.15" ><b class="bfseries">§15.</b></a></a>  Herein, the development of concentration that occurs from the time of the first conscious reaction up to the arising of the access of a given jhāna is called <em>progress</em>. And the understanding that occurs from the time of access until absorption is called <em>direct-knowledge</em>. That progress is difficult for some, being troublesome owing to the tenacious resistance of the inimical states beginning with the hindrances. The meaning is that it is cultivated without ease. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[87]</i></span> It is easy for others because of the absence of those difficulties. Also the direct-knowledge is sluggish in some and occurs slowly, not quickly. In others it is swift and occurs rapidly, not slowly. </p>
<p><a name="III.16" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  Herein, we shall comment below upon the suitable and unsuitable (<a href="ch-10.html#IV.35" >IV.35f.</a>), the preparatory tasks consisting in the severing of impediments (<a href="ch-10.html#IV.20" >IV.20</a>), etc., and skill in absorption (<a href="ch-10.html#IV.42" >IV.42</a>). When a man cultivates what is unsuitable, his progress is difficult and his direct-knowledge sluggish. When he cultivates what is suitable, his progress is easy and his direct-knowledge swift. But if he cultivates the unsuitable in the earlier stage and the suitable in the later stage, or if he cultivates the suitable in the earlier stage and the unsuitable in the later stage, then it should be understood as mixed in his case. Likewise if he devotes himself to development without carrying out the preparatory tasks of severing impediments, etc., his progress is difficult. It is easy in the opposite case. And if he is not accomplished in skill in absorption, his direct-knowledge is sluggish. It is swift if he is so accomplished. </p>
<p><a name="III.17" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.17" ><b class="bfseries">§17.</b></a></a>  Besides, they should be understood as classed according to craving and ignorance, and according to whether one has had practice in serenity and insight.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000507">

</a> For if a man is overwhelmed by craving, his progress is difficult. If not, it is easy. And if he is overwhelmed by ignorance, his direct-knowledge is sluggish. If not, it is swift. And if he has had no practice in serenity, his progress is difficult. If he has, it is easy. And if he has had no practice in insight, his direct-knowledge is sluggish. If he has, it is swift. </p>
<p><a name="III.18" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.18" ><b class="bfseries">§18.</b></a></a>  Also they should be understood as classed according to defilements and faculties. For if a man’s defilements are sharp and his faculties dull, then his progress <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{143|85}</small></span>is difficult and his direct-knowledge sluggish; but if his faculties are keen, his direct-knowledge is swift. And if his defilements are blunt and his faculties dull, then his progress is easy and his direct-knowledge sluggish; but if his faculties are keen, his direct-knowledge is swift. </p>
<p><a name="III.19" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.19" ><b class="bfseries">§19.</b></a></a>  So as regards this progress and this direct-knowledge, when a person reaches concentration with difficult progress and sluggish direct-knowledge, his concentration is called <em>concentration of difficult progress and sluggish direct-knowledge</em>; similarly in the cases of the remaining three. </p>
<p>So it is of four kinds as of difficult progress and sluggish direct-knowledge, and so on. </p>
<p><a name="III.20" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.20" ><b class="bfseries">§20.</b></a></a>  <em>11. </em>In the second tetrad there is limited concentration with a limited object, there is limited concentration with a measureless object, there is measureless concentration with a limited object, and there is measureless concentration with a measureless object. Herein, concentration that is unfamiliar and incapable of being a condition for a higher jhāna <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[88]</i></span> is <em>limited</em>. When it occurs with an unextended object (<a href="ch-10.html#IV.126" >IV.126</a>), it is <em>with a limited object</em>. When it is familiar, well developed, and capable of being a condition for a higher jhāna, it is <em>measureless</em>. And when it occurs with an extended object, it is <em>with a measureless object</em>. The mixed method can be understood as the mixture of the characteristics already stated. So it is of four kinds as limited with limited object, and so on. </p>
<p><a name="III.21" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.21" ><b class="bfseries">§21.</b></a></a>  <em>12. </em>In the third tetrad the first jhāna has five factors, that is to say, applied thought, sustained thought, happiness, bliss, and concentration, following suppression of the hindrances. The second has the three factors remaining after the elimination of applied and sustained thought. The third has two factors with the fading away of happiness. The fourth, where bliss is abandoned, has two factors with concentration and the equanimous feeling that accompanies it. Thus there are four kinds of concentration according to the factors of these four jhānas. So it is of four kinds according to the factors of the four jhānas. </p>
<p><a name="III.22" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.22" ><b class="bfseries">§22.</b></a></a>  <em>13. </em>In the fourth tetrad there is concentration partaking of diminution, there is concentration partaking of stagnation, there is concentration partaking of distinction, and there is concentration partaking of penetration. Herein, it should be understood that the state of <em>partaking of diminution </em>is accessibility to opposition, the state of <em>partaking of stagnation </em>(<em>ṭhiti</em>) is stationariness (<em>saṇṭhāna</em>) of the mindfulness that is in conformity with that [concentration], the state of <em>partaking of distinction </em>is the attaining of higher distinction, and the state of <em>partaking of penetration </em>is accessibility to perception and attention accompanied by dispassion, according as it is said: “When a man has attained the first jhāna and he is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by sense desire, then his understanding partakes of diminution. When his mindfulness that is in conformity with that stagnates, then his understanding partakes of stagnation. When he is accessible to perception and attention unaccompanied by applied thought, then his understanding partakes of distinction. When he is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by dispassion and directed to fading away, then his understanding partakes of penetration” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="III.23" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.23" ><b class="bfseries">§23.</b></a></a>  <em>14. </em>In the fifth tetrad there are the following four kinds of concentration, that is to say, sense-sphere concentration, fine-material-sphere concentration, immaterial-sphere concentration, and unincluded [that is, path] concentration. Herein, <em>sense-sphere concentration </em>is all kinds of access unification. Likewise the other three are respectively profitable unification of mind associated with fine-material, [immaterial, and path, jhāna]. So it is of four kinds as of the sense-sphere, and so on. </p>
<p><a name="III.24" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.24" ><b class="bfseries">§24.</b></a></a>  <em>15. </em>In the sixth tetrad: “If a bhikkhu obtains concentration, obtains unification of mind, by making zeal (desire) predominant, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[89]</i></span> this is called concentration due to zeal.

<p>The method of developing the kind of concentration associated with the noble paths mentioned (<a href="ch-09.html#III.7" >§7</a>) under that “of two kinds as mundane and supramundane,” etc., is included in the method of developing understanding; (<a href="ch-29.html#XXII" >Ch.

<p><a name="III.28" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.28" ><b class="bfseries">§28.</b></a></a>  But mundane concentration should be developed by one who has taken his stand on virtue that is quite purified in the way already stated. He should sever any of the ten impediments that he may have. He should then approach the good friend, the giver of a meditation subject, and he should apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament. After that he should avoid a monastery unfavourable to the development of concentration and <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{145|87}</small></span>go to live in one that is favourable. Then he should sever the lesser impediments and not overlook any of the directions for development. This is in brief. </p>

<p>Firstly it was said above, <em>he should sever any of the ten impediments that he may have</em>. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[90]</i></span> Now, the “ten impediments” are: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> A dwelling, family, and gain,<br /> A class, and building too as fifth,<br /> And travel, kin, affliction, books,<br /> And supernormal powers: ten. </blockquote>

</a> One of them made himself familiar with the Two Codes,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000509">

No doubt they will give it when we go into the town.” Early in the morning they went into the town together.

The bed and chair belong to the Community, and they are put away [as usual].

He then anointed the elder’s feet with the oil, made him a drink with the sugar, and presented him with the length of cloth. He then, after paying homage to the elder, told him, “Venerable sir, only Rohaṇa suits me,” and he departed.

So, although for three months he ate in the house of the mother who bore him, yet he never said ‘I am your son, you are my mother!’ Oh, admirable man!” Even mother and father are no impediment for one such as him, so how much less any other family that supports him. </p>
<p><a name="III.43" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.43" ><b class="bfseries">§43.</b></a></a>  <em>3. Gain </em>is the four requisites. How are they an impediment? Wherever a meritorious bhikkhu goes, people give him a large supply of requisites. With giving blessings to them and teaching them the Dhamma he gets no chance to do the ascetic’s duties. From sunrise till the first watch of the night he never breaks his association with people. Again, even at dawn, alms-food eaters fond of opulence come and say, “Venerable sir, such and such a man lay follower, woman lay follower, friend, friend’s daughter, wants to see you,” and being ready to go, he replies, “Take the bowl and robe, friend.” So he is always on the alert. Thus these requisites are an impediment for him. He should leave his group and wander by himself where he is not known. This is the way his impediment is severed. </p>
<p><a name="III.44" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.44" ><b class="bfseries">§44.</b></a></a>  <em>4. Class </em>is a class (group) of students of suttas or students of Abhidhamma. If with the group’s instruction and questioning he gets no opportunity for the ascetic’s duties, then that group is an impediment for him. He should sever that impediment in this way: if those bhikkhus have already acquired the main part and little still remains, he should finish that off and then go to the forest. If they have only acquired little and much still remains, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[94]</i></span> he should, without travelling more than a league, approach another instructor of a class within the radius of a league and say, “Help those venerable ones with instruction, etc.” If he does not find anyone in this way, he should take leave of the class, saying. “I have a task to see to, friends; go where it suits you,” and he should do his own work. </p>

It should be severed in this way. If little remains it should be completed. If much remains, it should be handed over to the Community or to bhikkhus who are entrusted with the Community’s affairs, if it is a new building for the Community; or if it is for himself, it should be handed over to those whom he entrusts with his own affairs, but if these are not available, he should relinquish it to the Community and depart. </p>

If someone is expected to give the going forth somewhere else, or if some requisite is obtainable there and he cannot rest content without getting it [that will be an impediment; for] even if he goes into the forest to do the ascetic’s duties, he will find it hard to get rid of thoughts about the journey.

When they are sick they are an impediment for him. Therefore that impediment should be severed by curing them with nursing. </p>

But the teacher from whom one takes the dependence, the teacher who gives one instruction, the pupil to whom one has given the dependence, the pupil to whom one is giving instruction, and those who have that same teacher as oneself, should be looked after as long as the dependence or the instruction has not been terminated.

If he has none, he should go in search of it as alms and give that. But in the case of brothers or sisters, one should only give them what is theirs. If they have none, then one should give one’s own temporarily and later get it back, but one should not complain if one does not get it back. It is not allowed either to make medicine for or to give it to a sister’s husband who is not related by blood; but one can give it to one’s sister saying, “Give it to your husband.” The same applies to one’s brother’s wife.

It is an impediment when it is actually afflicting; therefore it should be severed by treatment with medicine. But if it is not cured after taking medicine for a few days, then the ascetic’s duties should be done after apostrophizing one’s person in this way: “I am not your slave, or your hireling.

That is an impediment only for one who is constantly busy with recitations, etc., but not for others. Here are relevant stories. The Elder Revata, it seems, the Majjhima reciter, went to the Elder Revata, the dweller in Malaya (the Hill Country), and asked him for a meditation subject. The elder asked him, “How are you in the scriptures, friend?”—”I am studying the Majjhima [Nikāya], venerable sir.”—”The Majjhima is a hard responsibility, friend. When a man is still learning the First Fifty by heart, he is faced with the Middle Fifty; and when he is still learning that by heart, he is faced <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{150|92}</small></span>with the Last Fifty. How can you take up a meditation subject?”—”Venerable sir, when I have taken a meditation subject from you, I shall not look at the scriptures again.” He took the meditation subject, and doing no recitation for nineteen years, he reached Arahantship in the twentieth year. He told bhikkhus who came for recitation: “I have not looked at the scriptures for twenty years, friends, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[96]</i></span> yet I am familiar with them.

The Community of Bhikkhus said, “‘Which teachers’ teaching is it? Unless you give only the teaching of our own teachers we shall not let you speak.” Also his preceptor asked him when he went to wait on him, “Did you have the drum beaten, friend?”—”Yes, venerable sir.”—”For what reason?”—”I shall expound the scriptures, venerable sir.”—”Friend Abhaya, how do the teachers explain this passage?”—”They explain it in this way, venerable sir.” The elder dissented, saying “Hum.” Again three times, each time in a different way, he said, “They explain it in this way, venerable sir.” The elder always dissented, saying, “Hum.” Then he said, “Friend, your first explanation was the way of the teachers. But it is because you have not actually learnt it from the teachers’ lips that you are unable to maintain that the teachers say such and such. Go and learn it from our own teachers.”—”Where shall I go, venerable sir?”—”There is an elder named Mahā Dhammarakkhita living in the Tulādhārapabbata Monastery in the Rohaṇa country beyond the [Mahaveli] River. He knows all the scriptures. Go to him.” Saying, “Good, venerable sir,” he paid homage to the elder. He went with five hundred bhikkhus to the Elder Mahā-Dhammarakkhita, and when he had paid homage to him, he sat down. The elder asked, “Why have you come?”—”To hear the Dhamma, venerable sir.”—”Friend Abhaya, they ask me about the Dīgha and the Majjhima from time to time, but I have not looked at the others for thirty years. Still you may repeat them in my presence by night, and I shall explain them to you by day.” He said, “Good, venerable sir,” and he acted accordingly. </p>

Then he sat down on a mat on the ground before the Elder Abhaya and said, “Friend, explain a meditation subject to me.”—”What are you saying, venerable sir, have I not heard it all from you? What can I explain to you that you do not already know?” The senior elder said, “This path is different for one who has actually travelled by.” </p>

<p>But after his final attainment of Nibbāna, it is proper to take it from anyone of the eighty great disciples still living. When they are no more available, one who wants to take a particular meditation subject should take it from someone with cankers destroyed, who has, by means of that particular meditation subject, produced the fourfold and fivefold jhāna, and has reached the destruction of cankers by augmenting insight that had that jhāna as its proximate cause. </p>

If not even one who knows one Piṭaka is available, then it should be taken from one who is familiar with one Collection together with its commentary and one who is himself conscientious. For a teacher such as this, who knows the texts, guards the heritage, and protects the tradition, will follow the teachers’ opinion rather than his own.

But with a learned man, his instructions and his answers to questions are purified by his having approached such and such teachers, and so he will explain a meditation subject showing a broad track, like a big elephant going through a stretch of jungle, and he will select suttas and reasons from here and there, adding [explanations of] what is suitable and unsuitable. So a meditation subject should be taken by approaching the good friend such as this, the giver of a meditation subject, and by doing all the duties to him. </p>

<p>When [a bhikkhu] goes to him, he should not do so with feet washed and anointed, wearing sandals, with an umbrella, surrounded by pupils, and bringing oil tube, honey, molasses, etc.; he should do so fulfilling the duties of a bhikkhu setting out on a journey, carrying his bowl and robes himself, doing all the duties in each monastery on the way, with few belongings, and living in the greatest effacement. When entering that monastery, he should do so [expecting nothing, and even provided] with a tooth-stick that he has had made allowable on the way [according to the rules]. And he should not enter some other room, thinking, “I shall go to the teacher after resting awhile and after washing and anointing my feet, and so on.” </p>

So he should ask for the teacher’s dwelling and go straight there. </p>
<p><a name="III.68" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.68" ><b class="bfseries">§68.</b></a></a>  If the teacher is junior, he should not consent to the teacher’s receiving his bowl and robe, and so on. If the teacher is senior, then he should go and pay homage to him and remain standing. When told, “Put down the bowl and robe, friend,” he may put them down. When told, “Have some water to drink,” he can drink if he wants to. When told, “You may wash your feet,” he should not do so at once, for if the water has been brought by the teacher himself, it would be improper. But when told “Wash, friend, it was not brought by me, it was brought by others,” then he can wash his feet, sitting in a screened place out of sight of the teacher, or in the open to one side of the dwelling. </p>

For if it were oil for anointing the teacher’s limbs, it would not be proper. So he should first anoint his head, then his shoulders, etc.; but when told, “This is meant for all the limbs, friend, anoint your feet,” he should put a little on his head and then anoint his feet. Then he should give it back, saying when the teacher takes it, “May I return this oil tube, venerable sir?” </p>
<p><a name="III.70" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.70" ><b class="bfseries">§70.</b></a></a>  He should not say, “Explain a meditation subject to me, venerable sir” on the very day he arrives.

If he does not allow it when asked, they can be done when the opportunity offers. When he does them, three tooth-sticks should be brought, a small, a medium and a big one, and two kinds of mouth-washing water and bathing water, that is, hot and cold, should be set out. Whichever of these the teacher uses for three days should then be brought regularly. If the teacher uses either kind indiscriminately, he can bring whatever is available. </p>

Herein, this is the right performance of duties. He should rise early; removing his sandals and arranging his robe on one shoulder, he should give the tooth-sticks and the mouth-washing water, and he should prepare the seat.

If he does not ask but agrees to the duties being done, then after ten days or a fortnight have gone by he should make an opportunity by staying back one day at the time of his dismissal, and announcing the reason for his coming; or he should go at an unaccustomed time, and when asked, “What have you come for?” he can announce it. </p>
<p><a name="III.73" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.73" ><b class="bfseries">§73.</b></a></a>  If the teacher says, “Come in the morning,” he should do so. But if his stomach burns with a bile affliction at that hour, or if his food does not get digested owing to sluggish digestive heat, or if some other ailment afflicts him, he should let it be known, and proposing a time that suits himself, he should come at that time. For if a meditation subject is expounded at an inconvenient time, one cannot give attention. </p>
<p>This is the detailed explanation of the words “approach the good friend, the giver of a meditation subject.” </p>
<h2 id="a0000000101">8.4 Temperaments</h2>
<p><a name="III.74" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.74" ><b class="bfseries">§74.</b></a></a>  Now, as to the words, <em>one that suits his temperament </em>(<a href="ch-09.html#III.28" >§28</a>): there are six kinds of temperament, that is, greedy temperament, hating temperament, deluded temperament, faithful temperament, intelligent temperament, and speculative temperament. Some would have fourteen, taking these six single ones together with the four made up of the three double combinations and one triple combination with the greed triad and likewise with the faith triad. But if this classification is admitted, there are many more kinds of temperament possible by combining greed, etc., with faith, etc.; therefore the kinds of temperament should be understood briefly as only six. As to meaning the temperaments are one, that is to say, personal nature, idiosyncrasy. According to <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[102]</i></span> these there are only six types of persons, that is, one of greedy temperament, one of hating temperament, one of deluded temperament, one of faithful temperament, one of intelligent temperament, and one of speculative temperament. </p>
<p><a name="III.75" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.75" ><b class="bfseries">§75.</b></a></a>  Herein, one of faithful temperament is parallel to one of greedy temperament because faith is strong when profitable [kamma] occurs in one of greedy <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{155|97}</small></span>temperament, owing to its special qualities being near to those of greed. For, in an unprofitable way, greed is affectionate and not over-austere, and so, in a profitable way, is faith. Greed seeks out sense desires as object, while faith seeks out the special qualities of virtue and so on. And greed does not give up what is harmful, while faith does not give up what is beneficial. </p>
<p><a name="III.76" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.76" ><b class="bfseries">§76.</b></a></a>  One of intelligent temperament is parallel to one of hating temperament because understanding is strong when profitable [kamma] occurs in one of hating temperament, owing to its special qualities being near to those of hate. For, in an unprofitable way, hate is disaffected and does not hold to its object, and so, in a profitable way, is understanding. Hate seeks out only unreal faults, while understanding seeks out only real faults. And hate occurs in the mode of condemning living beings, while understanding occurs in the mode of condemning formations. </p>
<p><a name="III.77" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.77" ><b class="bfseries">§77.</b></a></a>  One of speculative temperament is parallel to one of deluded temperament because obstructive applied thoughts arise often in one of deluded temperament who is striving to arouse unarisen profitable states, owing to their special qualities being near to those of delusion. For just as delusion is restless owing to perplexity, so are applied thoughts that are due to thinking over various aspects. And just as delusion vacillates owing to superficiality, so do applied thoughts that are due to facile conjecturing. </p>
<p><a name="III.78" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.78" ><b class="bfseries">§78.</b></a></a>  Others say that there are three more kinds of temperament with craving, pride, and views. Herein craving is simply greed; and pride<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000518">
  <sup class="footnotemark">18</sup>
</a> is associated with that, so neither of them exceeds greed. And since views have their source in delusion, the temperament of views falls within the deluded temperament. </p>
<p><a name="III.79" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.79" ><b class="bfseries">§79.</b></a></a>  What is the source of these temperaments? And how is it to be known that such a person is of greedy temperament, that such a person is of one of those beginning with hating temperament? What suits one of what kind of temperament? </p>
<h3 id="a0000000102">Source of temperaments</h3>
<p><a name="III.80" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.80" ><b class="bfseries">§80.</b></a></a>  Herein, as some say,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000519">
  <sup class="footnotemark">19</sup>
</a> the first three kinds of temperament to begin with have their source in previous habit; and they have their source in elements and humours. Apparently one of greedy temperament has formerly had plenty of desirable tasks and gratifying work to do, or has reappeared here after dying in a heaven. And one <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{156|98}</small></span>of hating temperament has formerly had plenty of stabbing and torturing and brutal work to do or has reappeared here after dying in one of the hells or the nāga (serpent) existences. And one <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[103]</i></span> of deluded temperament has formerly drunk a lot of intoxicants and neglected learning and questioning, or has reappeared here after dying in the animal existence. It is in this way that they have their source in previous habit, they say. </p>
<p><a name="III.81" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.81" ><b class="bfseries">§81.</b></a></a>  Then a person is of deluded temperament because two elements are prominent, that is to say, the earth element and the water element. He is of hating temperament because the other two elements are prominent. But he is of greedy temperament because all four are equal. And as regards the humours, one of greedy temperament has phlegm in excess and one of deluded temperament has wind in excess. Or one of deluded temperament has phlegm in excess and one of greedy temperament has wind in excess. So they have their source in the elements and the humours, they say. </p>
<p><a name="III.82" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.82" ><b class="bfseries">§82.</b></a></a>  [Now, it can rightly be objected that] not all of those who have had plenty of desirable tasks and gratifying work to do, and who have reappeared here after dying in a heaven, are of greedy temperament, or the others respectively of hating and deluded temperament; and there is no such law of prominence of elements (see <a href="ch-21.html#XIV.43" >XIV.43f.</a>) as that asserted; and only the pair, greed and delusion, are given in the law of humours, and even that subsequently contradicts itself; and no source for even one among those beginning with one of faithful temperament is given. Consequently this definition is indecisive. </p>
<p><a name="III.83" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.83" ><b class="bfseries">§83.</b></a></a>  The following is the exposition according to the opinion of the teachers of the commentaries; or this is said in the “explanation of prominence”: “The fact that these beings have prominence of greed, prominence of hate, prominence of delusion, is governed by previous root-cause. </p>
<p>“For when in one man, at the moment of his accumulating [rebirth-producing] kamma, greed is strong and non-greed is weak, non-hate and non-delusion are strong and hate and delusion are weak, then his weak non-greed is unable to prevail over his greed, but his non-hate and non-delusion being strong are able to prevail over his hate and delusion. That is why, on being reborn through rebirth-linking given by that kamma, he has greed, is good-natured and unangry, and possesses understanding with knowledge like a lightning flash. </p>
<p><a name="III.84" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.84" ><b class="bfseries">§84.</b></a></a>  “When, at the moment of another’s accumulating kamma, greed and hate are strong and non-greed and non-hate weak, and non-delusion is strong and delusion weak, then in the way already stated he has both greed and hate but possesses understanding with knowledge like a lightning flash, like the Elder Datta-Abhaya. </p>
<p>“When, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, greed, non-hate and delusion are strong and the others are weak, then in the way already stated he both has greed and is dull but is good-tempered<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000520">
  <sup class="footnotemark">20</sup>
</a> and unangry, like the Elder Bahula. <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{157|99}</small></span>“Likewise when, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, the three, namely, greed, hate and delusion are strong and non-greed, etc., are weak, then in the way already stated he has both greed and hate and is deluded. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[104]</i></span> </p>
<p><a name="III.85" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.85" ><b class="bfseries">§85.</b></a></a>  “When, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, non-greed, hate and delusion are strong and the others are weak, then in the way already stated he has little defilement and is unshakable even on seeing a heavenly object, but he has hate and is slow in understanding. </p>
<p>“When, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, non-greed, non-hate and non-delusion are strong and the rest weak, then in the way already stated he has no greed and no hate, and is good-tempered but slow in understanding. </p>
<p>“Likewise when, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, non-greed, hate and non-delusion are strong and the rest weak, then in the way already stated he both has no greed and possesses understanding but has hate and is irascible. </p>
<p>“Likewise when, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, the three, that is, non-hate, non-greed, and non-delusion, are strong and greed, etc., are weak, then in the way already stated he has no greed and no hate and possesses understanding, like the Elder Mahā-Saṅgharakkhita.” </p>
<p><a name="III.86" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.86" ><b class="bfseries">§86.</b></a></a>  One who, as it is said here, “has greed” is one of greedy temperament; one who “has hate” and one who “is dull” are respectively of hating temperament and deluded temperament. One who “possesses understanding” is one of intelligent temperament. One who “has no greed” and one who “has no hate” are of faithful temperament because they are naturally trustful. Or just as one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by non-delusion is of intelligent temperament, so one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by strong faith is of faithful temperament, one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by thoughts of sense desire is of speculative temperament, and one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by mixed greed, etc., is of mixed temperament. So it is the kamma productive of rebirth-linking and accompanied by someone among the things beginning with greed that should be understood as the source of the temperaments. </p>

<p><a name="III.87" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.87" ><b class="bfseries">§87.</b></a></a>  But it was asked, <em>and how is it to be known that “This person is of greedy temperament?” </em>(<a href="ch-09.html#III.79" >§79</a>), and so on. This is explained as follows: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> By the posture, by the action,<br /> By eating, seeing, and so on,<br /> By the kind of states occurring, May temperament be recognized. </blockquote>
<p><a name="III.88" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.88" ><b class="bfseries">§88.</b></a></a>  Herein, <em>by the posture</em>: when one of greedy temperament is walking in his usual manner, he walks carefully, puts his foot down slowly, puts it down evenly, lifts it up evenly, and his step is springy.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000521">
  <sup class="footnotemark">21</sup>
</a> </p>
<p>One of hating temperament walks as though he were digging with the points of his feet, puts his foot down quickly, lifts it up quickly, and his step is dragged along. </p>
<p><span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{158|100}</small></span>One of deluded temperament walks with a perplexed gait, puts his foot down hesitantly, lifts it up hesitantly, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[105]</i></span> and his step is pressed down suddenly. </p>
<p>And this is said in the account of the origin of the Māgandiya Sutta: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> The step of one of greedy nature will be springy;<br /> The step of one of hating nature, dragged along;<br /> Deluded, he will suddenly press down his step;<br /> And one without defilement has a step like this.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000522">

</a> </blockquote>
<p><a name="III.89" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.89" ><b class="bfseries">§89.</b></a></a>  The stance of one of greedy temperament is confident and graceful. That of one of hating temperament is rigid. That of one of deluded temperament is muddled, likewise in sitting. And one of greedy temperament spreads his bed unhurriedly, lies down slowly, composing his limbs, and he sleeps in a confident manner. When woken, instead of getting up quickly, he gives his answer slowly as though doubtful. One of hating temperament spreads his bed hastily anyhow; with his body flung down he sleeps with a scowl. When woken, he gets up quickly and answers as though annoyed. One of deluded temperament spreads his bed all awry and sleeps mostly face downwards with his body sprawling. When woken, he gets up slowly, saying, “Hum.” </p>
<p><a name="III.90" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.90" ><b class="bfseries">§90.</b></a></a>  Since those of faithful temperament, etc., are parallel to those of greedy temperament, etc., their postures are therefore like those described above. </p>
<p>This firstly is how the temperaments may be recognized by the posture. </p>
<p><a name="III.91" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.91" ><b class="bfseries">§91.</b></a></a>  <em>By the action</em>: also in the acts of sweeping, etc., one of greedy temperament grasps the broom well, and he sweeps cleanly and evenly without hurrying or scattering the sand, as if he were strewing <em>sinduvāra </em>flowers. One of hating temperament grasps the broom tightly, and he sweeps uncleanly and unevenly with a harsh noise, hurriedly throwing up the sand on each side. One of deluded temperament grasps the broom loosely, and he sweeps neither cleanly nor evenly, mixing the sand up and turning it over. </p>
<p><a name="III.92" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.92" ><b class="bfseries">§92.</b></a></a>  As with sweeping, so too with any action such as washing and dyeing robes, and so on. One of greedy temperament acts skilfully, gently, evenly and carefully. One of hating temperament acts tensely, stiffly and unevenly. One of deluded temperament acts unskilfully as if muddled, unevenly and indecisively. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[106]</i></span> </p>
<p>Also one of greedy temperament wears his robe neither too tightly nor too loosely, confidently and level all round. One of hating temperament wears it too tight and not level all round. One of deluded temperament wears it loosely and in a muddled way. </p>
<p>Those of faithful temperament, etc., should be understood in the same way as those just described, since they are parallel. </p>
<p>This is how the temperaments may be recognized by the actions. </p>
<p><a name="III.93" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.93" ><b class="bfseries">§93.</b></a></a>  <em>By eating</em>: One of greedy temperament likes eating rich sweet food. When eating, he makes a round lump not too big and eats unhurriedly, savouring the various tastes. He enjoys getting something good. One of hating temperament likes eating rough sour food. When eating he makes a lump that fills his mouth, and he <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{159|101}</small></span>eats hurriedly without savouring the taste. He is aggrieved when he gets something not good. One of deluded temperament has no settled choice. When eating, he makes a small un-rounded lump, and as he eats he drops bits into his dish, smearing his face, with his mind astray, thinking of this and that. </p>
<p>Also those of faithful temperament, etc., should be understood in the same way as those just described since they are parallel. </p>
<p>This is how the temperament may be recognized by eating. </p>
<p><a name="III.94" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.94" ><b class="bfseries">§94.</b></a></a>  And <em>by seeing and so on</em>: when one of greedy temperament sees even a slightly pleasing visible object, he looks long as if surprised, he seizes on trivial virtues, discounts genuine faults, and when departing, he does so with regret as if unwilling to leave. When one of hating temperament sees even a slightly unpleasing visible object, he avoids looking long as if he were tired, he picks out trivial faults, discounts genuine virtues, and when departing, he does so without regret as if anxious to leave. When one of deluded temperament sees any sort of visible object, he copies what others do: if he hears others criticizing, he criticizes; if he hears others praising, he praises; but actually he feels equanimity in himself—the equanimity of unknowing. So too with sounds, and so on. </p>
<p>And those of faithful temperament, etc., should be understood in the same way as those just described since they are parallel. </p>

For even those of hating temperament can exhibit postures, etc., ascribed to the greedy temperament when they try diligently. And postures, etc., never arise with distinct characteristics in a person of mixed temperament. Only such directions for recognizing temperament as are given in the commentaries should be treated as authentic; for this is said: “A teacher who has acquired penetration of minds will know the temperament and will explain a meditation subject accordingly; one who has not should question the pupil.” So it is by penetration of minds or by questioning the person, that it can be known whether he is one of greedy temperament or one of those beginning with hating temperament. </p>

And it should be ugly and unsightly, exciting loathing as soon as looked at.

The right kind of road for him on which to wander for alms is disagreeable, with no village near, and uneven. The right kind of village for him in which to wander for alms is where people wander about as if oblivious of him, where, as he is about to leave without getting alms even from a single family, people call him into the sitting hall, saying, “Come, venerable sir,” and give him <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{161|103}</small></span>gruel and rice, but do so as casually as if they were putting a cow in a pen. Suitable people to serve him are slaves or workmen who are unsightly, ill-favoured, with dirty clothes, ill-smelling and disgusting, who serve him his gruel and rice as if they were throwing it rudely at him. The right kind of gruel and rice and hard food is poor, unsightly, made up of millet, <em>kudusaka</em>, broken rice, etc., stale buttermilk, sour gruel, curry of old vegetables, or anything at all that is merely for filling the stomach.

<p>The four divine abidings are these: loving-kindness, compassion, gladness, and equanimity. </p>
<p>The four immaterial states are these: the base consisting of boundless space, the base consisting of boundless consciousness, the base consisting of nothingness, and the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception. </p>
<p>The one perception is the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment. </p>
<p>The one defining is the defining of the four elements. </p>
<p>This is how the exposition should be understood “as to enumeration.” </p>

Herein, there is surmounting of factors in the case of all meditation subjects that bring three and four jhānas because the second jhāna, etc., have to be reached in those same objects by surmounting the jhāna factors of applied thought and sustained thought, and so on. Likewise in the case of the fourth divine abiding; for that has to be reached by surmounting joy in the same object as that of loving-kindness, and so on. But in the case of the four immaterial states there is surmounting of the object; for the base consisting of boundless space has to be reached by surmounting one or other of the first nine kasiṇas, and the base consisting of boundless consciousness, etc., have respectively to be reached by surmounting space, and so on.

Because they have a definite location and because there is no benefit in it. The definiteness of their location will become clear in explaining the method of development (<a href="ch-14.html#VIII.83" >VIII.83</a>–<a href="ch-14.html#VIII.138" >138</a> and <a href="ch-12.html#VI.40" >VI.40</a>, <a href="ch-12.html#VI.41" >41</a>, <a href="ch-12.html#VI.79" >79</a>). If the latter are extended, it is only a quantity of corpses that is extended <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[112]</i></span> and there is no benefit. And this is said in answer to the question of Sopāka: “Perception of visible forms is quite clear, Blessed One, perception of bones is not clear” (Source untraced<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000529">

For just as in [the Emperor] Dhammāsoka’s time the <em>Karavīka </em>bird uttered a sweet song when it saw its own reflection in the looking glass walls all round and perceived <em>Karavīkas</em> in every direction,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000530">

</a> so the Elder [Siṅgāla Pitar] <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{165|107}</small></span>thought, when he saw the sign appearing in all directions through his acquisition of the perception of a skeleton, that the whole earth was covered with bones. </p>

When a man extends the sign of in-breaths and out-breaths, only a quantity of wind is extended, and it has a definite location, [the nose-tip]. So it need not be extended because of the disadvantage and because of the definiteness of the location. And the divine abidings have living beings as their object. When a man extends the sign of these, only the quantity of living beings would be extended, and there is no purpose in that. So that also need not be extended. </p>

The disappearance of consciousness need not be extended since it is mere non-existence of consciousness. And the base consisting of neither <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{166|108}</small></span>perception nor non-perception as object need not be extended since it too is a state consisting in an individual essence.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000532">

The meaning is that in the early stage their sign must be apprehended by constantly looking with the eye.

The four divine abidings and four colour kasiṇas are eight suitable for one of hating temperament. Mindfulness of breathing is the one [recollection as a] meditation subject suitable for one of deluded temperament and for one of speculative temperament. The first six recollections are suitable for one of faithful temperament. Mindfulness of death, the recollection of peace, the defining of the four elements, and the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, are four suitable for one of intelligent temperament.

<p><a name="III.124" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.124" ><b class="bfseries">§124.</b></a></a>  Herein, he should dedicate himself to the Blessed One, the Enlightened One, in this way: “Blessed One, I relinquish this my person to you.” For without having thus dedicated himself, when living in a remote abode he might be unable to stand fast if a frightening object made its appearance, and he might return to a village abode, become associated with laymen, take up improper search and come to ruin. But when he has dedicated himself in this way no fear arises in him if a frightening object makes its appearance; in fact only joy arises in him as he reflects: “Have you not wisely already dedicated yourself to the Enlightened One?” </p>
<p><a name="III.125" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.125" ><b class="bfseries">§125.</b></a></a>  Suppose a man had a fine piece of Kāsi cloth.

Consequently the teacher does not help him with either material things or the Dhamma, and he does not train him in the cryptic books.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000537">

But if he has dedicated his person, he is not unresponsive to correction, does not go about as he likes, is easy to speak to, and lives only in dependence on the teacher. He gets the twofold help from the teacher and attains growth, increase, and fulfilment in the Dispensation. Like the Elder Cūḷa-Piṇḍapātika-Tissa’s pupils. </p>

<p><a name="III.130" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.130" ><b class="bfseries">§130.</b></a></a>  When, with sincerity of inclination and whole-hearted resolution in this way, he asks for a meditation subject, then a teacher who has acquired the penetration of minds can know his temperament by surveying his mental conduct; and a teacher who has not can know it by putting such questions to him as: “What is your temperament?” or “What states are usually present in you?” or “What do you like bringing to mind?” or “What meditation subject does your mind favour?” When he knows, he can expound a meditation subject suitable to that temperament. And in doing so, he can expound it in three ways: it can be expounded to one who has already learnt the meditation subject by having him recite it at one or two sessions; it can be expounded to one who lives in the same place each time he comes; and to one who wants to learn it and then go elsewhere it can be expounded in such a manner that it is neither too brief nor too long. </p>
<p><a name="III.131" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.131" ><b class="bfseries">§131.</b></a></a>  Herein, when first he is explaining the earth kasiṇa, there are nine aspects that he should explain. They are the four faults of the kasiṇa, the making of a kasiṇa, the method of development for one who has made it, the two kinds of sign, the two kinds of concentration, the seven kinds of suitable and unsuitable, the ten kinds of skill in absorption, evenness of energy, and the directions for absorption. </p>
<p>In the case of the other meditation subjects, each should be expounded in the way appropriate to it. All this will be made clear in the directions for development. But when the meditation subject is being expounded in this way, the meditator must apprehend the sign as he listens. </p>
<p><a name="III.132" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.132" ><b class="bfseries">§132.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{170|112}</small></span><em>Apprehend the sign</em> means that he must connect each aspect thus: “This is the preceding clause, this is the subsequent clause, this is its meaning, this is its intention, this is the simile.” When he listens attentively, apprehending the sign in this way, his meditation subject is well apprehended. Then, and because of that, he successfully attains distinction, but not otherwise. This clarifies the meaning of the words “and he must apprehend.” </p>
<p><a name="III.133" ><a href="ch-09.html#III.133" ><b class="bfseries">§133.</b></a></a>  At this point the clauses approach the good friend, the giver of a meditation subject, and he should apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament (<a href="ch-09.html#III.28" >§28</a>) have been expounded in detail in all their aspects. </p>

Another set of nine progressive stages in the decay of a corpse, mostly different from these, is given at <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>I 58</b>), it can be assumed that these nine, which are given in progressive order of decay in order to demonstrate the body’s impermanence, are not necessarily intended as contemplations of actual corpses so much as mental images to be created, the primary purpose being to cultivate impermanence. This may be why these nine are not used here (see <a href="ch-14.html#VIII.43" >VIII.43</a>). 
The word <em>asubha </em>(foul, foulness) is used both of the contemplations of corpses as here and of the contemplation of the parts of the body (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

Quadrupeds grazing in their pastures drop the grass in their mouths and listen to the sound. Beasts of prey hunting small animals pause with one foot raised. Hunted animals lose their fear of death and halt in their tracks. Birds flying in the air stay with wings outstretched. Fishes in the water keep still, not moving their fins. All listen to the sound, so beautiful is the Karavīka’s song. Dhammāsoka’s queen Asandhamittā asked the Community: ‘Venerable sirs, is there anything that sounds like the Buddha?’—‘The Karavīka birds does.’—‘Where are those birds, venerable sirs?’—‘In the Himalaya.’ 
She told the king: ‘Sire, I wish to hear a Karavīka bird.’ The king dispatched a gold cage with the order, ‘Let a Karavīka bird come and sit in this cage.’ The cage travelled and halted in front of a Karavīka. Thinking, ‘The cage has come at the king’s command; it is impossible not to go,’ the bird got in. The cage returned and stopped before the king. They could not get the Karavīka to utter a sound. When the king asked, ‘When do they utter a sound?’ they replied, ‘On seeing their kin.’ Then the king had it surrounded with looking-glasses. Seeing its own reflection and imagining that its relatives had come, it flapped its wings and cried out with an exquisite voice as if sounding a crystal trumpet. All the people in the city rushed about as if mad. Asandhamittā thought: ‘If the sound of this creature is so fine, what indeed can the sound of the Blessed One have been like since he had reached the glory of omniscient knowledge?’ and arousing a happiness that she never again relinquished, she became established in the fruition of stream-entry.”</li>
