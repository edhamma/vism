Now, in order to perfect those kinds of direct-knowledge the task must be undertaken by a meditator who has reached the fourth jhāna in the earth kasiṇa, and so on. And in doing this, not only will this development of concentration have provided benefits in this way, it will also have become more advanced; and when he thus possesses concentration so developed as to have both provided benefits and become more advanced, he will then more easily perfect the development of understanding. So meanwhile we shall deal with the explanation of the kinds of direct-knowledge now. </p>

<p><a name="XII.2" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.2" ><b class="bfseries">§2.</b></a></a>  In order to show the benefits of developing concentration to clansmen whose concentration has reached the fourth jhāna, and in order to teach progressively refined Dhamma, five kinds of mundane direct-knowledge have been described by the Blessed One. They are: (1) the kinds of supernormal power, described in the way beginning, “When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, and has become malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000797">

<h1 id="a0000000255">3 (1) The Kinds of Supernormal Power</h1>
<p>If a meditator wants to begin performing the transformation by supernormal power described as, “Having been one, he becomes many,” etc., he must achieve the eight attainments in each of the eight kasiṇas ending with the white kasiṇa. He must also have complete control of his mind in the following fourteen ways: <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[374]</i></span> (i) in the order of the kasiṇa, (ii) in the reverse order of the kasiṇa, (iii) in the <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{428|370}</small></span>order and reverse order of the kasiṇa, (iv) in the order of the jhāna, (v) in the reverse order of the jhāna (vi) in the order and reverse order of the jhāna, (vii) skipping jhāna, (viii) skipping kasiṇa, (ix) skipping jhāna and kasiṇa, (x) transposition of factors, (xi) transposition of object, (xii) transposition of factors and object, (xiii) definition of factors, and (xiv) definition of object. </p>
<p><a name="XII.3" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.3" ><b class="bfseries">§3.</b></a></a>  But what is “in the order of the kasiṇa” here? What is “definition of object”? </p>
<p>(i) Here a bhikkhu attains jhāna in the earth kasiṇa, after that in the water kasiṇa, and so progressing through the eight kasiṇas, doing so even a hundred times, even a thousand times, in each one. This is called <em>in the order of the kasiṇas</em>. (ii) Attaining them in like manner in reverse order, starting with the white kasiṇa, is called <em>in the reverse order of the kasiṇas</em>. (iii) Attaining them again and again in forward and reverse order, from the earth kasiṇa up to the white kasiṇa and from the white kasiṇa back to the earth kasiṇa, is called <em>in the order and reverse order of the kasiṇas</em>. </p>
<p><a name="XII.4" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  (iv) Attaining again and again from the first jhāna up to the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception is called <em>in the order of the jhānas.</em> (v) Attaining again and again from the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception back to the first jhāna is called <em>in the reverse order of the jhānas</em>. (vi) Attaining in forward and reverse order, from the first jhāna up to the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception and from the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception back to the first jhāna, is called <em>in the order and reverse order of the jhānas</em>. </p>
<p><a name="XII.5" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.5" ><b class="bfseries">§5.</b></a></a>  (vii) He skips alternate jhānas without skipping the kasiṇas in the following way: having first attained the first jhāna in the earth kasiṇa, he attains the third jhāna in that same kasiṇa, and after that, having removed [the kasiṇa (<a href="ch-16.html#X.6" >X.6</a>), he attains] the base consisting of boundless space, after that the base consisting of nothingness. This is called <em>skipping jhānas</em>. And that based on the water kasiṇa, etc., should be construed similarly. (viii) When he skips alternate kasiṇas without skipping jhānas in the following way: having attained the first jhāna in the earth kasiṇa, he again attains that same jhāna in the fire kasiṇa and then in the blue kasiṇa and then in the red kasiṇa, this is called <em>skipping kasiṇas</em>. (ix) When he skips both jhānas and kasiṇas in the following way: having attained the first jhāna in the earth kasiṇa, he next attains the third in the fire kasiṇa, next the base consisting of boundless space after removing the blue kasiṇa, next the base consisting of nothingness [arrived at] from the red kasiṇa, this is called <em>skipping jhānas and kasiṇas</em>. </p>
<p><a name="XII.6" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.6" ><b class="bfseries">§6.</b></a></a>  (x) Attaining the first jhāna in the earth kasiṇa <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[375]</i></span> and then attaining the others in that same kasiṇa is called <em>transposition of factors</em>. (xi) Attaining the first jhāna in the earth kasiṇa and then that same jhāna in the water kasiṇa … in the white kasiṇa is called <em>transposition of object</em>. (xii) Transposition of object and factors together takes place in the following way: he attains the first jhāna in the earth kasiṇa, the second jhāna in the water kasiṇa, the third in the fire kasiṇa, the fourth in the air kasiṇa, the base consisting of boundless space by removing the blue kasiṇa, the base consisting of boundless consciousness [arrived at] from the yellow kasiṇa, the base consisting of nothingness from the red kasiṇa, <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{429|371}</small></span>and the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception from the white kasiṇa. This is called <em>transposition of factors and object</em>. </p>
<p><a name="XII.7" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.7" ><b class="bfseries">§7.</b></a></a>  (xiii) The defining of only the jhāna factors by defining the first jhāna as five-factored, the second as three-factored, the third as two-factored, and likewise the fourth, the base consisting of boundless space, … and the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception, is called <em>definition of factors</em>. (xiv) Likewise, the defining of only the object as “This is the earth kasiṇa,” “This is the water kasiṇa” … “This is the white kasiṇa,” is called <em>definition of object</em>. Some would also have “defining of factors and object”; but since that is not given in the commentaries it is certainly not a heading in the development. </p>
<p><a name="XII.8" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.8" ><b class="bfseries">§8.</b></a></a>  It is not possible for a meditator to begin to accomplish transformation by supernormal powers unless he has previously completed his development by controlling his mind in these fourteen ways. Now, the kasiṇa preliminary work is difficult for a beginner and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. The arousing of the sign is difficult for one who has done the preliminary work and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. To extend the sign when it has arisen and to reach absorption is difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. To tame one’s mind in the fourteen ways after reaching absorption is difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. The transformation by supernormal power after training one’s mind in the fourteen ways is difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. Rapid response after attaining transformation is difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. </p>
<p><a name="XII.9" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.9" ><b class="bfseries">§9.</b></a></a>  Like the Elder Rakkhita who, eight years after his full admission to the Order, was in the midst of thirty thousand bhikkhus possessing supernormal powers who had come to attend upon the sickness of the Elder Mahā-Rohaṇa-Gutta at Therambatthala. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[376]</i></span> His feat is mentioned under the earth kasiṇa (<a href="ch-10.html#IV.135" >IV.135</a>). Seeing his feat, an elder said, “Friends, if Rakkhita had not been there, we should have been put to shame. [It could have been said], ‘They were unable to protect the royal nāga.’ So we ourselves ought to go about [with our abilities perfected], just as it is proper (for soldiers) to go about with weapons cleaned of stains.” The thirty thousand bhikkhus heeded the elder’s advice and achieved rapid response. </p>
<p><a name="XII.10" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.10" ><b class="bfseries">§10.</b></a></a>  And helping another after acquiring rapidity in responding is difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. Like the elder who gave protection against the rain of embers by creating earth in the sky, when the rain of embers was produced by Māra at the <em>Giribhaṇḍavahana</em> offering. <a class="footnote" href="#a0000000798">

<p><a name="XII.11" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.11" ><b class="bfseries">§11.</b></a></a>  It is only in Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, chief disciples, etc., who have vast previous endeavour behind them, that this transformation by supernormal power <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{430|372}</small></span>and other such special qualities as the discriminations are brought to success simply with the attainment of Arahantship and without the progressive course of development of the kind just described. </p>
<p><a name="XII.12" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.12" ><b class="bfseries">§12.</b></a></a>  So just as when a goldsmith wants to make some kind of ornament, he does so only after making the gold malleable and wieldy by smelting it, etc., and just as when a potter wants to make some kind of vessel, he does so only after making the clay well kneaded and malleable, a beginner too must likewise prepare for the kinds of supernormal powers by controlling his mind in these fourteen ways; and he must do so also by making his mind malleable and wieldy both by attaining under the headings of zeal, consciousness, energy, and inquiry,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000799">
  <sup class="footnotemark">3</sup>
</a> and by mastery in adverting, and so on. But one who already has the required condition for it owing to practice in previous lives needs only prepare himself by acquiring mastery in the fourth jhāna in the kasiṇas. </p>
<p><a name="XII.13" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.13" ><b class="bfseries">§13.</b></a></a>  Now, the Blessed One showed how the preparation should be done in saying, “When his concentrated mind,” and so on. Here is the explanation, which follows the text (see <a href="ch-18.html#XII.2" >§2</a>). Herein, <em>he</em> is a meditator who has attained the fourth jhāna. <em>Thus</em> signifies the order in which the fourth jhāna comes; having obtained the fourth jhāna in this order beginning with attaining the first jhāna, is what is meant. <em>Concentrated</em>: concentrated by means of the fourth jhāna. <em>Mind</em>: fine-material-sphere consciousness. </p>
<p><a name="XII.14" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.14" ><b class="bfseries">§14.</b></a></a>  But as to the words “purified,” etc., it is <em>purified</em> by means of the state of mindfulness purified by equanimity. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[377]</i></span> It is <em>bright</em> precisely because it is <em>purified</em>; it is limpid (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>I 10</b>), is what is meant. It is <em>unblemished</em> since the blemishes consisting of greed, etc., are eliminated by the removal of their conditions consisting of bliss, and the rest. It is <em>rid of defilement</em> precisely because it is unblemished; for it is by the blemish that the consciousness becomes defiled. It has <em>become malleable</em> because it is well developed; it suffers mastery, is what is meant, for consciousness that suffers mastery is called “malleable.” It is <em>wieldy </em>(<em>kammanīya</em>) precisely because it is malleable; it suffers being worked (<em>kammakkhama</em>), is fit to be worked (<em>kammayogga</em>), is what is meant. </p>
<p><a name="XII.15" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.15" ><b class="bfseries">§15.</b></a></a>  For a malleable consciousness is wieldy, like well-smelted gold; and it is both of these because it is well developed, according as it is said: “Bhikkhus, I do not see anyone thing that, when developed and cultivated, becomes so malleable and wieldy as does the mind” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XII.16" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  It is <em>steady</em> because it is steadied in this purifiedness, and the rest. It is <em>attained to imperturbability</em> (<em>āneñjappatta</em>) precisely because it is steady; it is motionless, without perturbation (<em>niriñjana</em>), is what is meant. Or alternatively, it is steady because steady in its own masterability through malleability and wieldiness, and it is <em>attained to imperturbability</em> because it is reinforced by faith, and so on. </p>
<p><a name="XII.17" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.17" ><b class="bfseries">§17.</b></a></a>  For consciousness reinforced by faith is not perturbed by faithlessness; when reinforced by energy, it is not perturbed by idleness; when reinforced by mindfulness, it is not perturbed by negligence; when reinforced by concentration, <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{431|373}</small></span>it is not perturbed by agitation; when reinforced by understanding, it is not perturbed by ignorance; and when illuminated, it is not perturbed by the darkness of defilement.

</a>It is <em>rid of defilement</em> owing to the disappearance of the defilements of the mind consisting in covetousness, etc.; and both of these should be understood according to the Anaṅgaṇa Sutta (MN 5) and the Vattha Sutta (MN 7). It is <em>become malleable</em> by masterability. It is <em>wieldy</em> by reaching the state of a road to power (<a href="ch-18.html#XII.50" >§50</a>). It is <em>steady and attained to imperturbability</em> by reaching the refinement of completed development; the meaning is that according as it has attained imperturbability so it is steady.

He becomes a hundred simultaneously with the resolving consciousness. The same method applies in the case of a thousand, and so on. If he does not succeed in this way, he should do the preliminary work again, and attain, emerge, and resolve a second time.

After emerging from the attainment, he again adverts thus, “Let me be many,” after which he resolves by means of the single [consciousness] belonging to the knowledge of direct-knowledge, which has arisen next to the three, or four, preparatory consciousnesses that have occurred, and which has the name “resolve” owing to its making the decision.

And he saw right down to Avīci, and up to the Realm of the Highest Gods. That day, it seems, was called the day of the Revelation of Worlds (<em>loka-vivaraṇa</em>).

The same method of explanation applies to the other clauses too. </p>
<p><a name="XII.121" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.121" ><b class="bfseries">§121.</b></a></a>  Herein, who has taken what was far and made it near? The Blessed One. For when the Blessed One was going to the divine world after the Twin Miracle, he made Yugandhara and Sineru near, and from the earth’s surface he set one foot <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[403]</i></span> on Yugandhara, and then he set the other on the summit of Sineru. </p>
<p><a name="XII.122" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.122" ><b class="bfseries">§122.</b></a></a>  Who else has done it? The Elder Mahā Moggallāna. For when the elder was leaving Sāvatthī after completing his meal, he abridged the twelve-league crowd and the thirty-league road to the city of Saṅkassa, and he arrived at the same moment. </p>
<p><a name="XII.123" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.123" ><b class="bfseries">§123.</b></a></a>  Furthermore, the Elder Cūḷa Samudda did it as well in Tambapaṇṇi Island. During a time of scarcity, it seems, seven hundred bhikkhus came to the elder one morning. The elder thought, “Where can a large community of bhikkhus wander for alms?” He saw nowhere at all in Tambapaṇṇi Island, but he saw that it would be possible on the other shore at Pāṭaliputta (Patna). He got the bhikkhus to take their bowls and [outer] robes, and he said, “Come friends, let us go wandering for alms.” Then he abridged the earth and went to Pāṭaliputta. The bhikkhus asked, “What is the city, venerable sir?”—“It is Pāṭaliputta, friends.”—“Pāṭaliputta is far away, venerable sir.”—“Friends, experienced elders make what is far near.”—“Where is the ocean (<em>mahā-samudda</em>), venerable sir?”—“Friends, did you not cross a blue stream on the way as you came?”—“Yes, venerable sir, but the ocean is vast.”—“Friends, experienced elders also make what is vast small.” </p>
<p><a name="XII.124" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.124" ><b class="bfseries">§124.</b></a></a>  And the Elder Tissadatta did likewise, when he had put on his upper robes after bathing in the evening, and the thought of paying homage at the Great Enlightenment Tree arose in him. </p>
<p><a name="XII.125" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.125" ><b class="bfseries">§125.</b></a></a>  Who has taken what was near and made it far? The Blessed One. For although Aṅgulimāla was near to the Blessed One, yet he made him far (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XII.126" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.126" ><b class="bfseries">§126.</b></a></a>  Who has made much little? The Elder Mahā Kassapa. One feast day at Rājagaha, it seems, there were five hundred girls on their way to enjoy the festival, and they had taken moon cakes with them. They saw the Blessed One but gave <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{454|396}</small></span>him nothing. On their way back, however, they saw the elder. Thinking, “He is our elder,” they each took a cake and approached the elder. The elder took out his bowl and made a single bowlful of them all. The Blessed One had sat down first to await the elder. The elder brought them and gave them to the Blessed One. </p>
<p><a name="XII.127" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.127" ><b class="bfseries">§127.</b></a></a>  In the story of the rich man Illīsa, however, (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>I 372</b>) the Elder Mahā Moggallāna made little much. And in the story of Kākavaḷiya the Blessed One did so. The Elder Mahā Kassapa, it seems, after spending seven days in attainment, stood at the house door of a man in poor circumstances called Kākavaḷiya in order to show favour to the poor. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[404]</i></span> His wife saw the elder, and she poured into his bowl the unsalted sour gruel that she had cooked for her husband. The elder took it and placed it in the Blessed One’s hand. The Blessed One resolved to make it enough for the Greater Community of Bhikkhus. What was brought in a single bowl became enough for all. And on the seventh day Kākavaḷiya became a rich man. </p>
<p><a name="XII.128" ><a href="ch-18.html#XII.128" ><b class="bfseries">§128.</b></a></a>  And not only in the case of making little much, but whatever the possessor of supernormal power wishes, whether to make the sweet unsweet, etc., it is successful for him. For so it was that when the Elder Mahā Anula saw many bhikkhus sitting on the banks of the Gaṅgā River [in Sri Lanka] eating plain rice, which was all that they had got after doing their alms round, he resolved, “Let the Gaṅgā River water be cream of ghee,” and he gave a sign to the novices. They fetched it in their vessels and gave it to the Community of Bhikkhus. All of them ate their meal with sweet cream of ghee. </p>

And it is perception associated with equanimity that is called “perception of bliss”; for equanimity is called “bliss” since it is peaceful. And that same perception should be understood to be called “perception of lightness” too because it is liberated from hindrances and from the things that oppose it beginning with applied thought. But when he arrives at that state, his physical body too becomes as light as a tuft of cotton. He goes to the Brahmā-world thus with a visible body as light as a tuft of cotton wafted by the wind. </p>

If he wishes, he resolves by means of the air kasiṇa that there shall be air, and he goes by air like a tuft of cotton. Moreover, the desire to go is the measure here. When there is the desire to go, one who has made his mental resolve in this way goes visibly, carried by the force of the resolution like an arrow shot by an archer. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[405]</i></span> </p>

And when, while remaining here, he stands with that Brahmā, converses, enters into communication with that Brahmā, he does not wield bodily power in doing that. And when he makes his resolve described in the way beginning “though far, he resolves upon nearness,” he does not wield bodily power in doing that. And when he goes to the Brahmā-world with a visible or an invisible body, he does not wield bodily power in doing that. But when he enters upon the process described in the way beginning, “He creates a visible form before that Brahmā, mind-made,” then he wields bodily power in doing that. The rest, however, is said here for the purpose of showing the stage prior to the wielding of the bodily power. This, firstly, is (i) success by resolve (<a href="ch-18.html#XII.45" >§45</a>). </p>

<p>(i) One, firstly, who performs a transformation <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[406]</i></span> should resolve upon whatever he chooses from among the things beginning with the appearance of a boy, described as follows: “He abandons his normal appearance and shows the appearance of a boy or the appearance of a nāga (serpent), or the appearance of a supaṇṇa (winged demon), or the appearance of an asura (demon), or the appearance of the Ruler [of Gods] (Indra), or the appearance of some [other sensual-sphere] deity, or the appearance of a Brahmā, or the appearance of the sea, or the appearance of a rock, or the appearance of a lion, or the appearance of a tiger, or the appearance of a leopard, or he shows an elephant, or he shows a horse, or he shows a chariot, or he shows a foot soldier, or he shows a manifold military array” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

Herein, instead of resolving, “Let me be an elephant,” he resolves, “Let there be an elephant.” The same method applies in the case of the horse and the rest. </p>
<p><span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{457|399}</small></span>This is success as transformation. </p>

Then he adverts to another body inside it, and having done the preliminary work in the way already described, he resolves, “Let there be another body inside it.” Then he draws it out like a reed from its sheath, like a sword from its scabbard, like a snake from its slough. Hence it is said: “Here a bhikkhu creates from this body another body possessing visible form, mind-made, with all its limbs, lacking no faculty. Just as though a man pulled out a reed from its sheath and thought thus: ‘This is the sheath; this is the reed; the sheath is one, the reed is another, it was from the sheath that the reed was pulled out’” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p>This is success as the mind-made [body]. </p>

Herein, just as when a pint measure (<em>āḷhaka</em>) of milk is poured into a number of pints of water, though the milk becomes completely mixed up with the water, and is present appreciably in all, it is nevertheless not the milk that has increased there, but only the water. And so too, although the clung-to and unclung-to occur mixed up together, it is nevertheless not the clung-to that is enlarged. It should be taken that it is the consciousness-born matter that is enlarged by the influence of the supernormal power, and the temperature-born is enlarged <em>pari passu</em>” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

But how does the body, whose going [being that of matter] is slow, come to have the same going as the mind, which quickly passes? Its going is not the same in all respects; for in the case of converting the mind to conform with the body, the mind does not come to have the same going as the body in all respects. For it is not that the mind then occurs with the moment of a material state, which passes slowly, instead of passing with its own kind of moment, which is what establishes its individual essence. But rather the mind is called ‘converted to accord with the going of the body’ as long as it goes on occurring in a continuity that conforms with the body until the desired place is arrived at. This is because its passing occurs parallel with that of the body, whose going is slow, owing to the resolution, ‘Let the mind be like this body.’ And likewise, it is while the body keeps occurring in suchwise that its arrival at the desired place comes about in only a few quick passes of the mind instead of passing slowly, as in those who have not developed the roads to power—and this mode of occurrence is due to the possession of the perception of lightness, to say nothing of the resolve, ‘Let this body be like this mind’—that the body is called ‘converted to accord with the going of the mind,’ not because it arrives at the desired place in a single consciousness moment. And when taken thus the simile, ‘Just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm, or bend his outstretched arm’ (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

And this must be accepted in this way without reserve, otherwise there is conflict with the Suttas, the Abhidhamma and the Commentary, as well as contradiction of natural law (<em>dhammatā</em>). ‘Bhikkhus, I see no other one thing that is so quickly transformed as the mind’ (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

And in the Abhidhamma only matter is called prenascence condition and only consciousness postnascence condition. And wherever states (<em>dhamma</em>) arise, there they dissolve. There is no transmigration to an adjacent location (<em>desantara-saṅkamana</em>), nor does the individual essence become other. For it is not possible to effect any alteration of the characteristics of dhammas by force of the roads to power. But it is possible to effect alteration of the mode in which they are present (<em>bhāva</em>)” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
