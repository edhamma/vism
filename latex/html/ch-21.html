<blockquote class="verse"> When a wise man, established well in virtue,<br /> Develops consciousness and understanding (<a href="ch-06.html#I.1" >I.1</a>). </blockquote>
<p>And that has been developed in all its aspects by the bhikkhu who is thus possessed of the more advanced development of concentration that has acquired with direct-knowledge the benefits [described in Chs. XII and XIII]. But <em>understanding</em> comes next and that has still to be developed. Now, that is not easy, firstly even to know about, let alone to develop, when it is taught very briefly. In order, therefore, to deal with the detailed method of its development there is the following set of questions: </p>
<ol class="enumerate" style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
  <li><p>What is understanding? </p>
</li>
  <li><p>In what sense is it understanding? </p>
</li>
  <li><p>What are its characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause? </p>
</li>
  <li><p>How many kinds of understanding are there? </p>

</ol>
<p><a name="XIV.2" ><a href="ch-21.html#XIV.2" ><b class="bfseries">§2.</b></a></a>  Here are the answers: </p>
<h2 id="a0000000265">1.1 (i) What is understanding?</h2>
<p>Understanding (<em>paññā</em>) is of many sorts and has various aspects. An answer that attempted to explain it all would accomplish neither its intention nor its purpose, and would, besides, lead to distraction; so we shall confine ourselves to the kind intended here, which is understanding consisting in insight knowledge associated with profitable consciousness. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000266">1.2 (ii) In what sense is it understanding?</h2>
<p><a name="XIV.3" ><a href="ch-21.html#XIV.3" ><b class="bfseries">§3.</b></a></a>  (ii) <span class="scshape">In what sense is it understanding?</span> It is understanding (<em>paññā</em>) in the sense of act of understanding (<em>pajānana</em>).<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000844">
  <sup class="footnotemark">1</sup>
</a> What is this act of understanding? It is <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{490|432}</small></span>knowing (<em>jānana</em>) in a particular mode separate from the modes of perceiving (<em>sañjānana</em>) and cognizing (<em>vijānana</em>). <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[437]</i></span> For though the state of knowing (<em>jānana-bhāva</em>) is equally present in perception (<em>saññā</em>), in consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>), and in understanding (<em>paññā</em>), nevertheless perception is only the mere perceiving of an object as, say, blue or yellow; it cannot bring about the penetration of its characteristics as impermanent, painful, and not-self. Consciousness knows the objects as blue or yellow, and it brings about the penetration of its characteristics, but it cannot bring about, by endeavouring, the manifestation of the [supramundane] path. Understanding knows the object in the way already stated, it brings about the penetration of the characteristics, and it brings about, by endeavouring, the manifestation of the path. </p>
<p><a name="XIV.4" ><a href="ch-21.html#XIV.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  Suppose there were three people, a child without discretion, a villager, and a money-changer, who saw a heap of coins lying on a money-changer’s counter. The child without discretion knows merely that the coins are figured and ornamented, long, square or round; he does not know that they are reckoned as valuable for human use and enjoyment. And the villager knows that they are figured and ornamented, etc., and that they are reckoned as valuable for human use and enjoyment; but he does not know such distinctions as, “This one is genuine, this is false, this is half-value.” The money-changer knows all those kinds, and he does so by looking at the coin, and by listening to the sound of it when struck, and by smelling its smell, tasting its taste, and weighing it in his hand, and he knows that it was made in a certain village or town or city or on a certain mountain or by a certain master. And this may be understood as an illustration. </p>
<p><a name="XIV.5" ><a href="ch-21.html#XIV.5" ><b class="bfseries">§5.</b></a></a>  Perception is like the child without discretion seeing the coin, because it apprehends the mere mode of appearance of the object as blue and so on. Consciousness is like the villager seeing the coin, because it apprehends the mode of the object as blue, etc., and because it extends further, reaching the penetration of its characteristics. Understanding is like the money-changer seeing the coin, because, after apprehending the mode of the object as blue, etc., and extending to the penetration of the characteristics, it extends still further, reaching the manifestation of the path. </p>
<p><a name="XIV.6" ><a href="ch-21.html#XIV.6" ><b class="bfseries">§6.</b></a></a>  That is why this act of understanding should be understood as “knowing in a particular mode separate from the modes of perceiving and cognizing.” For that is what the words “it is understanding in the sense of act of understanding” refer to. However, it is not always to be found where perception and consciousness are.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000845">
  <sup class="footnotemark">2</sup>
</a> <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[438]</i></span> But when it is, it is not disconnected from those states. And because it cannot be taken as disconnected thus: “This is perception, this is consciousness, this is understanding,” its difference is consequently subtle and hard to see. Hence the venerable Nāgasena said: “A difficult thing, O King, has been done by the Blessed One.”—“What, venerable Nāgasena, is the difficult thing that has been done by the Blessed One?”—“The difficult thing, O King, done by the Blessed One was the <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{491|433}</small></span>defining of the immaterial states of consciousness and its concomitants, which occur with a single object, and which he declared thus: ‘This is contact, this is feeling, this is perception, this is volition, this is consciousness’” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

Understanding belonging to two of the kinds of sense-sphere profitable consciousness, and belonging to (the remaining) four kinds of path consciousness with the fifth jhānas is <em>accompanied by equanimity</em>.

<p><a name="XIV.14" ><a href="ch-21.html#XIV.14" ><b class="bfseries">§14.</b></a></a>  <em>7.</em> As regards the triads, understanding acquired without hearing from another is that <em>consisting in what is reasoned</em> because it is produced by one’s own reasoning. Understanding acquired by hearing from another is that <em>consisting in what is heard</em>, because it is produced by hearing. Understanding that has reached absorption, having been somehow produced by (meditative) development, is that consisting in development. And this is said: Herein, what is understanding consisting in what is reasoned? In the spheres of work invented by ingenuity, or in the spheres of craft invented by ingenuity, or in the sorts of science invented by ingenuity, any preference, view, choice, opinion, judgment, liking for pondering over things, that concerns ownership of deeds (<em>kamma</em>) or is in conformity with truth or is of such kind as to conform with (the axioms) ‘Materiality is impermanent’ or ‘Feeling … perception … formations … <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{493|435}</small></span>consciousness is impermanent’ that one acquires without hearing it from another—that is called understanding consisting in what is reasoned. </p>

That which occurs contingent upon fine-material-sphere states or immaterial-sphere states has an <em>exalted</em> object. That is mundane insight. That which occurs contingent upon Nibbāna has a <em>measureless</em> object. That is supramundane insight. So it is of three kinds as having a limited, an exalted, or a measureless object. </p>
<p><a name="XIV.16" ><a href="ch-21.html#XIV.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  <em>9.</em> In the third triad, it is increase that is called improvement. That is twofold as the elimination of harm and the arousing of good. Skill in improvement is skill in these, according as it is said: Herein, what is skill in improvement? When a man brings these things to mind both unarisen unprofitable things do not arise and arisen unprofitable things are abandoned in him; or when he brings these things to mind <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[440]</i></span> both unarisen profitable things arise and arisen profitable things advance to growth, increase, development, and perfection in him.

That also is twofold as the diminution of good and the arousing of harm. Skill in detriment is skill in these, according as it is said: “Herein, what is skill in detriment? When a man brings these things to mind, both unarisen profitable things do not arise …” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

But it is called “verbal intimation” because it is the cause of the intimating of intention by means of the voice in speech, and because it is itself intimatable through speech, in other words, through that voice in speech.

<p>Both of these are terms for matter at its birth; but owing to difference of mode, and according to [different persons’] susceptibility to instruction, the teaching in the summary (<em>uddesa</em>) in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī is given as “growth and continuity” (cf. <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

Setting up is stated by sense-base; sense-base is stated by setting up.” Consequently, it is the first genesis of material instances that is their <em>setting up</em>; the genesis also of others that are generated in addition to those is <em>growth</em> since it appears in the aspect of increase; the repeated genesis also of others that are generated in addition to those is <em>continuity</em> since it appears in the aspect of anchoring.

<p>It is of two kinds as internal and external, gross and subtle, far and near, produced (<em>nipphanna</em>) and unproduced, sensitive matter and insensitive matter, faculty and non-faculty, clung to and not-clung to, and so on. </p>
<p><a name="XIV.73" ><a href="ch-21.html#XIV.73" ><b class="bfseries">§73.</b></a></a>  Herein, the five kinds beginning with the eye are <em>internal</em> because they occur as an integral part of the selfhood (in oneself); the rest are <em>external </em>because they are external to that selfhood (personality). The nine beginning with the eye and the three elements excepting the water element, making twelve kinds in all, are to be taken as <em>gross</em> because of impinging; the rest are <em>subtle</em> because they are the opposite of that. What is subtle is <em>far</em> because it is difficult to penetrate, the other is <em>near</em> because it is easy to penetrate. The eighteen kinds of matter, that is to say, the four elements, the thirteen beginning with the eye, and physical nutriment, are produced because they can be discerned through their own individual essences, having exceeded the [purely conceptual] states of [matter as] delimitation, [matter as] alteration, and [matter as] characteristic (see <a href="ch-21.html#XIV.77" >§77</a>); the rest, being the opposite, are <em>unproduced</em>. The five kinds beginning with the <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{511|453}</small></span>eye are <em>sensitive matter</em> through their being conditions for the apprehension of visible data, etc., because they are, as it were, bright like the surface of a looking glass; the rest are <em>insensitive matter</em> because they are the opposite of that. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[451]</i></span> Sensitive matter itself, together with the three beginning with the femininity faculty, is <em>faculty</em> in the sense of predominance; the rest are <em>not-faculty</em> because they are the opposite of that.

<p>That born from consciousness is <em>consciousness-born</em>; that born from a condition other than consciousness is <em>not-consciousness-born</em>; that not born from anything is <em>neither-consciousness-born-nor-not-consciousness-born</em>. </p>

<p>Herein, the visible-data base is <em>seen</em> because it is the objective field of seeing. The sound base is <em>heard</em> because it is the objective field of hearing.

<p>Herein, what is kamma-born only or consciousness-born only is called <em>born of one</em>. Of these, materiality of the faculties, together with the heart-basis, is kamma-born only; the two intimations are consciousness-born only.

Because there is no arising of arising, and the other two are the mere maturing and breakup of what has arisen. Though in the passage, “The visible-data base, the sound base, the odour base, the flavour base, the tangible-data base, the space element, the water element, lightness of matter, malleability of matter, wieldiness of matter, growth of matter, continuity of matter, and physical food—these states are consciousness-originated” (cf. <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XIV.105" ><a href="ch-21.html#XIV.105" ><b class="bfseries">§105.</b></a></a>  III. i. D.

<p>III. ii. A. 1. Herein, that without root-cause is that devoid of non-greed, etc., as the cause of result. That is of two kinds, being classed as (70) mind-element, and (71)–(72) mind-consciousness-element. </p>

<p><a name="XIV.108" ><a href="ch-21.html#XIV.108" ><b class="bfseries">§108.</b></a></a>  But the mind-consciousness-element is of two kinds, namely, shared by all and not shared by all. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[457]</i></span> Herein, (71) that shared by all is the functional [mind-consciousness-element] accompanied by equanimity without root-cause.

Its proximate cause is the departure either of the resultant mind-consciousness-element without root-cause (40)–(41) [in the first case], or of one among the kinds of life-continuum [in the second]. (72) That <em>not shared by all </em>is the functional [mind-consciousness-element] accompanied by joy without root-cause. It has the characteristic of cognizing the six kinds of objects.

</a> in Arahants about things that are not sublime. It is manifested as the state corresponding to that [last-mentioned function]. Its proximate cause is always the heart-basis. </p>
<p>So the sense-sphere functional without root-cause is of three kinds. </p>
<p><a name="XIV.109" ><a href="ch-21.html#XIV.109" ><b class="bfseries">§109.</b></a></a>  III. ii. A. 2. That, however, <em>with root cause</em> is of eight kinds (73)–(80), like the profitable (1)–(8), being classed according to joy and so on. While the profitable <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{520|462}</small></span>arises in trainers and ordinary men only, this arises in Arahants only.

<p>III. ii. B., III. ii. C.

<p><a name="XIV.110" ><a href="ch-21.html#XIV.110" ><b class="bfseries">§110.</b></a></a>  So the 21 kinds of profitable, the 12 kinds of unprofitable, the 36 kinds of resultant, and the 20 kinds of functional, amount in all to 89 kinds of consciousness.

It makes the mind different from the previous [life-continuum] mind, thus it is attention. It has three ways of doing this: as the controller of the object, as the controller of the cognitive series, and as the controller of impulsions. Herein, the controller of <em>the object</em> is the maker in the mind, thus it is <em>attention</em>. That has the characteristic of conducting (<em>sāraṇa</em>). Its function is to yoke associated states to the object. It is manifested as confrontation with an object. Its proximate cause is an object. It should be regarded as the conductor (<em>sārathi</em>) of associated states by controlling the object, itself being included in the formations aggregate. <em>Controller of the cognitive series</em> is a term for five-door adverting (70). <em>Controller of impulsions</em> is a term for mind-door adverting (71).

It has the characteristic of conveying consciousness and consciousness-concomitants evenly. Its function is to prevent deficiency and excess, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[467]</i></span> or its function is to inhibit partiality. It is manifested as neutrality. It should be regarded as like a conductor (driver) who looks with equanimity on thoroughbreds progressing evenly. </p>

This is the only difference. Some, however, want to include among the inconstant both loving-kindness and equanimity. That cannot be accepted for, as to meaning, non-hate itself is loving-kindness, and specific neutrality is equanimity. </p>

Their function is to draw back from the fields of bodily misconduct, and so on. They are manifested as the not doing of these things. Their proximate causes are the special qualities of <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{533|475}</small></span>faith, conscience, shame, fewness of wishes, and so on.

Any feeling whatever … Any perception whatever … Any formations whatever … Any consciousness whatever, whether past, future or present … all that together in the mass and in the gross is called the consciousness aggregate” (Vibh 1–9; cf. <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

The second is according to the specialized kamma generated thus, “Let my eye be thus.” This is what they say. But it can be taken that the first-mentioned characteristic is stated as sensitivity’s interest in lighting up its own objective fields, the five senses’ state of sensitivity being taken as a generality; and that the second is stated as the seeing that is due to the particular division of its own cause, the sensitivities’ cause as the state of kamma being taken as a generality or as a unity. The same method applies to the ear and so on. 
“Here it may be asked, ‘Is the arising of the faculties of the eye, etc., due to kamma that is one or to kamma that is different?’ Now, the Ancients say, “In both ways.” Herein, firstly, in the case of the arising of an eye, etc., due to kamma that is different there is nothing to be explained since the cause is divided up. But when their arising is due to kamma that is one, how does there come to be differentiation among them? It is due to dividedness in the cause too. For it is craving, in the form of longing for this or that kind of becoming that, itself having specific forms owing to hankering after the sense-bases included in some kind of becoming or other, contrives, acting as decisive-support, the specific divisions in the kamma that generates such a kind of becoming. As soon as the kamma has acquired the differentiation induced by that [hankering] it generates through effort consisting in appropriate ability a multiple fruit with differentiated individual essences, as though it had itself taken on a multiple form. And the ability here need not be understood as anything other than the able state; for it is simply the effort of producing fruit that is differentiated by the differentiation due to the differentiation in its cause. And the fact of this differentiating effort on the part of kamma that is one being the cause of the multiple faculties will be dealt with below as to logic and texts (note 21). Besides, it is told how one kind of consciousness only is the cause of the generation of the sixteen kinds of resultant consciousness and so on; and in the world it is also found that a single paddy seed is the cause of the generation of the ripe, the unripe, the husked, and the unhusked fruit.

The amplification in this paragraph is from Vism-mhṭ, which continues: “There is another method: the eye and the ear have non-contiguous objective fields because arising of consciousness is caused while their objective fields are separated by an interval and apart <em>(adhika). </em>Some say that the ear has a contiguous objective field. If it did, then sound born of consciousness would not be the object of ear-consciousness, for there is no arising externally of what is consciousness-originated. And in the texts sound as object is spoken of as being the object of ear-consciousness without making any distinction. Besides, there would be no defining the direction and position of the sound because it would then have to be apprehended in the place occupied by the possessor of the objective field, as happens in the case of an odour. Consequently it remains in the same place where it arose, if it comes into focus in the ear avenue (so the Burmese ed.). Are not the sounds of washermen [beating their washing on stones] heard later by those who stand at a distance? No; because there is a difference in the way of apprehending a sound according to the ways in which it becomes evident to one nearby and to one at a distance. For just as, because of difference in the way of apprehending the sound of words according to the ways in which it becomes evident to one at a distance and to one nearby, there comes to be [respectively] not apprehending, and apprehending of the differences in the syllables, so also, when the sound of washermen (a) becomes [an occurrence] that is evident throughout from beginning to end to one who is nearby, and (b) becomes an occurrence that is evident in compressed form in the end or in the middle to one who is at a distance, it is because there is a difference in the apprehending and definition, which occur later in the cognitive series of ear-consciousness, that there comes to be the assumption <em>(abhimāna) </em>‘Heard faintly is heard later.’ But that sound comes into the ear’s focus at the moment of its own existence and in dependence on the place where it arises (see XIII. 112; <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

And so ‘it is manifested as the reason for the mark,’ etc., is said making the femininity faculty their cause. 
“As regards the ‘mark of the female,’ etc., too, its ‘facultiness’ is stated as predominance, in other words, as a state of cause, because the conditions for the modal matter (<em>ākāra-rūpa</em>) consisting of the mark of the female, etc., in a continuity accompanied by faculties do not arise otherwise, and because these kinds of materiality are a condition for apprehending the female.

For while eye consciousness, etc., have the eye, etc., as their respective supports absolutely, mind-consciousness does not in the same way have the heart-basis as its support absolutely. And the teaching in the physical-basis dyad <em>(vatthu-duka) </em>is given by way of the material support thus, ‘There is matter that is the physical basis of eye-consciousness, there is matter that is not the physical basis of eye-consciousness’ (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

That is why the heart-basis is not mentioned, not because it is unapprehendable. 
“(ii) But the logical reasoning should be understood in this way. In the five constituent becoming, [that is, in the sense sphere and fine-material sphere,] these two elements have as their support produced <em>(nipphanna) </em>derived matter. Herein, since the visible-data base, etc., and nutritive essence, are found to occur apart from what is bound up with faculties, to make them the support would be illogical. And since these two elements are found in a continuity that is devoid of the femininity and masculinity faculties [i.e. in the Brahmā-world], to make them the support would be illogical too. And in the case of the life faculty that would have to have another function, so to make it the support would be illogical too. So it is the heart-basis that remains to be recognized as their support. For it is possible to say that these two elements have as their support produced derived matter, since existence is bound up with matter in the five-constituent becoming. Whatever has its existence bound up with matter is found to have as its support produced derived matter, as the eye-consciousness-element does. And the distinction ‘in the five-constituent becoming’ is made on account of the mind-consciousness-element; in the four-constituent becoming, [that is, the immaterial sphere,] there is no mind-element. Does there not follow contradiction of the middle term <em>(hetu) </em>because of establishing faculties as their support? No; because that is disproved by what is seen. For these two elements are not, as in the case of eye-consciousness, controlled by the slackness and keenness, etc., of their physical basis; and accordingly it is not said in the texts that they have the faculties as their condition. Hence their having faculties as their support, in other words, their being controlled by them, is disproved. 
“Granted that these two elements have as their support the derived matter consisting of the heart-basis, how is it to be known that it is kamma-originated, has an invariable function, and is to be found located in the heart? It may be said to be kamma-originated because, like the eye, it is the materiality of a physical basis; and because of that it has an invariable function; because it is the materiality of a physical basis and because it is a support for consciousness, is the meaning. It is known that its location is there because of the heart’s exhaustion <em>(khijjana) </em>in one who thinks of anything, bringing it to mind intently and directing his whole mind to it” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

And excess of air element in a material group <em>(kalāpa) </em>does not contradict the words ‘of the air element’; and excess is in capability, not in quantity, otherwise their inseparability would be illogical. According to some it is that of the air element only. In their opinion the state of derived matter is inapplicable <em>(durupapāda) </em>to intimation, since the alteration of one is not that of all. But this [air element] is apprehended by mind-door impulsion that is next to the non-intimating [apprehension] that is next to the apprehension of the appearance of motion in the movement of the hands, and so on. There is a certain kind of alteration that is separate from the appearance of motion. And the apprehension of the former is next to the apprehension of the latter. How is that to be known? By the apprehension of intention. For no apprehension of intention such as, ‘He is getting this done, it seems’ is met with in the case of trees’ movements, etc., which are devoid of intention. But it is met with in the case of hand movements and so on. Therefore there is a certain kind of alteration that is separate from the appearance of motion, and it is known as the ‘intimator of the intention.’ Also it is known by inference that the apprehension of the alteration is next to the apprehension of the appearance thus: The intimator intimates the meaning to be intimated only when it is apprehended as a cause, not merely as present. For they say accordingly: 
Sounds that have entered no objective field Do not awaken any kind of meaning; And also beings merely recognized As such communicate no meanings either. 
“If just the apprehension of the alteration is the reason for the apprehension of the intention, why is there no apprehension of intention in unapprehended communication <em>(saṅketa)ī </em>It is not only just the apprehension of the alteration that is the reason for the apprehension of the intention; but rather it should be taken that the apprehension of the previously-established connection is the decisive support for this. The stiffening, upholding, and movement are due to the air-element associated with the alteration belonging to the intimation, is what is said. What, is it all the air-element that does all those things? It is not like that. For it is the air element given rise to by the seventh impulsion that, by acquiring as its reinforcing conditions the air elements given rise to by the preceding impulsions, moves consciousness-originated matter by acting as cause for its successive arisings in adjacent locations, <em>(desantaruppatti—</em>cf. <a href="ch-14.html#VIII" >Ch. VIII</a>, n. 54) not the others. The others, however, help it by doing the stiffening and upholding, the successive arising in adjacent locations being itself the movement. So the instrumentality should be taken as attributed when there is the sign [of movement]; otherwise there would not be uninterestedness and momentariness of dhammas. And here the cart to be drawn by seven yokes is given as simile in the Commentary. But when consciousness-born matter moves, the kinds of matter born of temperature, kamma, and nutriment move too because they are bound up with it, like a piece of dry cow-dung thrown into a river’s current. 
“Since it has been said that the apprehension of intimation is next to the apprehension of the appearance of motion, how then, is the air element itself as the maker of the movement accompanied by the alteration consisting in the intimation? It is not like that. It is the air elements given rise to by the first impulsion, etc., and which are unable to cause movement in that way and perform only the stiffening and upholding, that should be taken as only accompanied by the alteration belonging to intimation. For it is the alteration coexistent with the intention that is the intimation, because of giving rise to alteration in whatever direction it wishes to cause the occurrence of moving forward and so on. Taking it in this way, it is perfectly logical to say that the origination of intimation belongs to mind-door adverting. Since the intention possessed of the aforesaid alteration is intimated through the apprehension of that alteration, it is said that ‘Its function is to display intention.’ The air element being the cause of the motion of the bodily intimation, is figuratively said, as a state of alteration, to be ‘manifested as the cause of bodily motion.’ ‘Its proximate cause is the consciousness-originated air-element’ is said since the air element’s excessive function is the cause of intimating intention by movement of the body” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

Pali has five principal words, <em>nāma, viññāṇa, mano, citta,</em> and <em>ceto,</em> against the normal English <em>consciousness </em>and <em>mind.</em> While their etymology can be looked up in the dictionary, one or two points need noting here. <em>Nāma</em> (rendered by “mentality” when not used to refer to a <em>name</em>) is almost confined in the sense considered to the expression <em>nāma-rūpa</em> (“mentality-materiality”) as the fourth member of the dependent origination, where it comprises the three mental aggregates of feeling, perception and formations, but not that of consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>). <em>Viññāṇa</em> (rendered by “consciousness”) is, loosely, more or less a synonym for <em>mano</em> and <em>citta</em>; technically, it is bare cognition considered apart from feeling, perception or formations. <em>Mano</em> (rendered by “mind”), when used technically, is confined to the sixth internal base for contact (<a href="ch-22.html#XV" >Ch.

“Because there is similarity and dissimilarity in temperature, etc., in the way stated, the pastness, etc., of material instances originated by it are stated according to continuity. But there is no such similarity and dissimilarity in the kamma that gives birth to a single becoming, so instead of stating according to continuity the pastness, etc., of material instances originated by that, it is stated according to what consolidates. However, when there comes to be reversal of sex, then the male sex disappears owing to powerful unprofitable kamma, and the female sex appears owing to weak profitable kamma; and the female sex disappears owing to weak unprofitable kamma, while the male sex appears owing to powerful profitable kamma (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
