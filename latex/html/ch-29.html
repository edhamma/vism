Its position is to advert to the path, and so it belongs neither to purification by knowledge and vision of the way nor to purification by knowledge and vision, but being intermediate, it is unassignable. Still it is reckoned as insight because it falls in line with insight. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.2" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.2" ><b class="bfseries">§2.</b></a></a>  Purification by knowledge and vision properly consists in knowledge of the four paths, that is to say, the path of stream-entry, the path of once-return, the path of non-return, and the path of Arahantship. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000390">1.1 The First Path—First Noble Person</h2>
<p><a name="XXII.3" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.3" ><b class="bfseries">§3.</b></a></a>  Herein, nothing further needs to be done by one who wants to achieve, firstly, the knowledge of the first path. For what he needs to do has already been done by arousing the insight that ends in conformity knowledge. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.4" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  As soon as conformity knowledge has arisen in him in this way, and the thick murk that hides the truths has been dispelled by the respective force peculiar to each of the three kinds of conformity (see <a href="ch-28.html#XXI.129" >XXI.129f.</a>), then his consciousness no longer enters into or settles down on or resolves upon any field of formations at all, or clings, cleaves or clutches on to it, but retreats, retracts and recoils as water does from a lotus leaf, and every sign as object, every occurrence as object, appears as an impediment. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.5" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.5" ><b class="bfseries">§5.</b></a></a>  Then, while every sign and occurrence appears to him as an impediment, when conformity knowledge’s repetition has ended, change-of-lineage knowledge arises in him, which takes as its object the signless, non-occurrence, non-formation, cessation, Nibbāna,—which knowledge passes out of the lineage, the category, the plane, of the ordinary man and enters the lineage, the category, the plane, of the Noble Ones,—which, being the first adverting, the first concern, the first reaction, to Nibbāna as object, fulfils the state of a condition for the path in six ways, as proximity, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[673]</i></span> contiguity, repetition, decisive-support, absence, and disappearance conditions,—which is the culminating peak of insight,—which is irrevocable,—of which it is said: </p>
<p><span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{760|702}</small></span>“How is it that understanding of emergence and turning away from the external<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001119">

<p>“It overcomes arising, thus it is change-of-lineage. It overcomes occurrence … [the sign … accumulation … rebirth-linking … destiny … generation … re-arising … birth … ageing … sickness … death … sorrow … lamentation … ]. It overcomes despair, thus it is change-of-lineage. It overcomes the sign of formations externally, thus it is change-of-lineage. </p>

<p><a name="XXII.6" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.6" ><b class="bfseries">§6.</b></a></a>  Here is a simile that illustrates how conformity and change-of-lineage occur with different objects though occurring in a single cognitive series with a single adverting. Suppose a man wanted to leap across a broad stream and establish himself on the opposite bank, he would run fast, and seizing a rope fastened to the branch of a tree on the stream’s near bank and hanging down, or a pole, he would leap with his body tending, inclining and leaning towards the opposite bank, and when he had arrived above the opposite bank, he would let go, fall on to the opposite bank, staggering first and then steady himself there; so too this meditator, who wants to establish himself on Nibbāna, the bank opposite to the kinds of becoming, generation, destiny, station, and abode, runs fast by means of the contemplation of rise and fall, etc., and seizing with conformity’s adverting to impermanence, pain or not-self the rope of materiality fastened to the branch of his selfhood and hanging down, or one among the poles beginning with feeling, he leaps with the first conformity consciousness without letting go and with the second he tends, inclines and leans towards Nibbāna, like the body that was tending, inclining and leaning towards the opposite bank; then, being with the third next to Nibbāna, which is now attainable, like the other’s arriving above the opposite bank, he lets go that information as object with the ceasing of that consciousness, and with the change-of-lineage consciousness he falls on to the unformed Nibbāna, the bank opposite; but staggering, as the man did, for lack of [previous] repetition, he is not yet properly steady on the single object. After that he is steadied by path knowledge. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.7" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.7" ><b class="bfseries">§7.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{761|703}</small></span>Herein, conformity is able to dispel the murk of defilements that conceals the truths, but is unable to make Nibbāna its object. Change-of-lineage is only able to make Nibbāna its object, but it is unable to dispel the murk that conceals the truths. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.8" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.8" ><b class="bfseries">§8.</b></a></a>  Here is a simile: <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[674]</i></span> A man with eyes went out at night, it seems, to find out the conjunction of the stars, and he looked up to see the moon. It was invisible because it was concealed by clouds. Then a wind sprang up and blew away the thick clouds; another blew away the medium clouds; and another blew away the fine clouds as well. Then the man saw the moon in the sky free from clouds, and he found out the conjunction of the stars. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.9" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.9" ><b class="bfseries">§9.</b></a></a>  Herein, the thick, medium and fine kinds of darkness that conceal the truths are like the three kinds of cloud. The three kinds of conformity consciousness are like the three winds. Change-of-lineage knowledge is like the man with eyes. Nibbāna is like the moon. The dispelling of the murk that conceals the truths by each kind of conformity consciousness is like the successive blowing away of the clouds by each wind. Change-of-lineage knowledge’s seeing the clear Nibbāna when the murk that concealed the truths has disappeared is like the man’s seeing the clear moon in the sky free from cloud. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.10" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.10" ><b class="bfseries">§10.</b></a></a>  Just as the three winds are able only to blow away the clouds that conceal the moon but cannot see the moon, so the three kinds of conformity are able only to dispel the murk that conceals the truths but cannot see Nibbāna. Just as the man can only see the moon but cannot blow away the clouds, so change-of-lineage knowledge can only see Nibbāna but cannot dispel the defilements. Hence it is called “adverting to the path.” </p>
<p><a name="XXII.11" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.11" ><b class="bfseries">§11.</b></a></a>  For although it is not adverting, it occupies the position of adverting; and then, after, as it were, giving a sign to the path to come into being, it ceases. And without pausing after the sign given by that the change-of-lineage knowledge, the path follows upon it in uninterrupted continuity, and as it comes into being it pierces and explodes the mass of greed, the mass of hate, and the mass of delusion never pierced and exploded before (cf. <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Paṭis" >Paṭis</a>
	]
</span>II 20</b>). </p>
<p><a name="XXII.12" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.12" ><b class="bfseries">§12.</b></a></a>  Here is a simile for this. An archer, it seems, had a target<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001121">
  <sup class="footnotemark">3</sup>
</a> set up at a distance of eight <em>usabhas</em> (about 100 yards), and wrapping his face in a cloth and arming himself with an arrow, he stood on a wheel contrivance (a revolving platform). Another man turned the wheel contrivance, and when the target was opposite the archer, he gave him a sign with a stick. Without pausing after the sign the archer shot the arrow and hit the target. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.13" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.13" ><b class="bfseries">§13.</b></a></a>  Herein, change-of-lineage knowledge is like the sign with the stick. Path knowledge is like the archer. Path knowledge’s <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[675]</i></span> making Nibbāna its object without pausing after the sign given by change-of-lineage, and its piercing and exploding the mass of greed, hate and delusion never pierced and exploded before, is like the archer’s hitting the target without pausing after the sign. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.14" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.14" ><b class="bfseries">§14.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{762|704}</small></span>And not only does it cause the piercing of this mass of greed, etc., but it also dries up the ocean of suffering of the round in the beginningless round of rebirths. It closes all doors to the states of loss. It provides actual experience of the seven noble treasures.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001122">
  <sup class="footnotemark">4</sup>
</a> It abandons the eightfold wrong path. It allays all enmity and fear.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001123">
  <sup class="footnotemark">5</sup>
</a> It leads to the state of the Fully Enlightened One’s breast-born son (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>II 221</b>). And it leads to the acquisition of many hundred other blessings. So it is the knowledge associated with the path of stream-entry, the provider of many hundred blessings, that is called knowledge of the path of stream-entry. </p>
<p>The first kind of knowledge is ended. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000391">1.2 The First Fruition—Second Noble Person</h2>
<p><a name="XXII.15" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.15" ><b class="bfseries">§15.</b></a></a>  Immediately next to that knowledge, however, there arise either two or three fruition consciousnesses, which are its result. For it is owing to this very fact that supramundane profitable [consciousness] results immediately that it is said, “And which he called the concentration with immediate result” (Sn 226), and “Sluggishly he reaches what has immediate result for the destruction of the cankers” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#A" >A</a>
	]
</span>II 149</b>), and so on. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.16" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  Some, however, say that there are one, two, three, four, or five fruition consciousnesses. That is inadmissible. For change-of-lineage knowledge arises at the end of conformity’s repetition, so at the minimum there must be two conformity consciousnesses, since one alone does not act as repetition condition. And a single series of impulsions has a maximum of seven [impulsion] consciousnesses. Consequently, that series which has two conformities and change-of-lineage as a third and path consciousness as fourth has three fruition consciousnesses. That which has three conformities and change-of-lineage as fourth and path consciousness as fifth has two fruition consciousnesses. That is why it was said above, “There arise either two or three fruition consciousnesses.” </p>
<p><a name="XXII.17" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.17" ><b class="bfseries">§17.</b></a></a>  Then some say that which has four conformities and change-of-lineage as fifth and path consciousness as sixth has one fruition consciousness. But that is refuted because it is the fourth or fifth [impulsion] that reaches [the path], not those after that, owing to their nearness to the life-continuum (see <a href="ch-10.html#IV.75" >IV.75</a>). So that cannot be accepted as correct. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[676]</i></span> </p>
<p><a name="XXII.18" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.18" ><b class="bfseries">§18.</b></a></a>  And at this point this stream-enterer is called the second noble person. However negligent he may be, he is bound to make an end of suffering when he has travelled and traversed the round of rebirths among deities and human beings for the seventh time. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.19" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.19" ><b class="bfseries">§19.</b></a></a>  At the end of the fruition his consciousness enters the life-continuum. After that, it arises as mind-door adverting interrupting the life-continuum for the purpose of reviewing the path. When that has ceased, seven impulsions of path reviewing <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{763|705}</small></span>arise. After re-entry into the life-continuum, adverting, etc., arise again in the same way for the purpose of reviewing fruition, and so on. With the arising of these he reviews the path, he reviews the fruition, he reviews the defilements abandoned, he reviews the defilements still remaining, and he reviews Nibbāna. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.20" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.20" ><b class="bfseries">§20.</b></a></a>  He reviews the path in this way, “So this is the path I have come by.” Next he reviews the fruition after that in this way, “This is the blessing I have obtained.” Next he reviews the defilements that have been abandoned, “These are the defilements abandoned in me.” Next he reviews the defilements still to be eliminated by the three higher paths, “These are the defilements still remaining in me.” And lastly he reviews the deathless Nibbāna in this way, “This is the state (<em>dhamma</em>) that has been penetrated by me as object.” So the noble disciple who is a stream-enterer has five kinds of reviewing. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.21" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.21" ><b class="bfseries">§21.</b></a></a>  And as in the case of the stream-enterer, so also in the cases of the once-returner and non-returner. But the Arahant has no reviewing of remaining defilements. So all the kinds of reviewing total nineteen. This is the maximum number. Trainers may or may not have the reviewing of the defilements abandoned and those still remaining. In fact it was owing to the absence of such reviewing that Mahānāma asked the Blessed One, “What state is there still unabandoned by me internally owing to which at times states of greed invade my mind and remain?” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XXII.22" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.22" ><b class="bfseries">§22.</b></a></a>  However, after reviewing in this way, either while sitting in the same session or on another occasion, the noble disciple who is a stream-enterer makes it his task to reach the second plane by attenuating both greed for sense desires and ill-will. He brings to bear the faculties,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001124">
  <sup class="footnotemark">6</sup>
</a> the powers, and the enlightenment factors, and he works over and turns up that same field of formations, classed as materiality, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, with the knowledge that they are impermanent, painful, not-self, and he embarks upon the progressive series of insights. </p>

<p><a name="XXII.26" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.26" ><b class="bfseries">§26.</b></a></a>  When he has done so, and when, at the end of equanimity about formations, conformity and change-of-lineage have arisen in a single adverting in the way already described, then the path of non-return arises next to change-of-lineage.

He brings to bear the faculties, the powers, and the enlightenment factors, and he works over <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[678]</i></span> and turns up that same field of formations with the knowledge that they are impermanent, painful, not-self, and he embarks upon the progressive series of insights. </p>

What is future, which is non-existent, that he abandons.” But this is denied in this way: “He does not abandon future defilements.” Then the objection is put in this way: “If he abandons present defilements, then though inflamed with greed he abandons greed, though corrupted with hate he abandons hate, though deluded he abandons delusion, though shackled<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001135">

And if that were what is called “arisen by having soil [to grow in]” no one could abandon the root of becoming because it would be unabandonable.

  <sup class="footnotemark">20</sup>
</a> For the defilements that are the root of the round are inherent in [one’s own] aggregates not fully understood by insight from the instant those aggregates arise. And that is what should be understood as “arisen by having the soil [to grow in],” in the sense of its being unabandoned. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[688]</i></span> </p>
<p><a name="XXII.84" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.84" ><b class="bfseries">§84.</b></a></a>  Now, when defilements are inherent, in the sense of being unabandoned, in someone’s aggregates, it is only those aggregates of his that are the basis for those defilements, not aggregates belonging to another.

Similarly too only sense-sphere aggregates, not others, are the basis for defilements that inhere unabandoned in sense-sphere aggregates.

<p><a name="XXII.85" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.85" ><b class="bfseries">§85.</b></a></a>  But in the case of the stream-enterer, etc., when a given defilement, which is a root of the round, has been abandoned by means of a given path in a given noble person’s aggregates, then his aggregates are no longer called “soil” for such defilement since they are no longer a basis for it. But in an ordinary man the defilements that are the root of the round are not abandoned at all, and so whatever kamma he performs is always either profitable or unprofitable. So for him the round goes on revolving with kamma and defilements as its condition. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.86" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.86" ><b class="bfseries">§86.</b></a></a>  But while it is thus the root of the round it cannot be said that it is only in his materiality aggregate, and not in his other aggregates beginning with feeling … that it is only in his consciousness aggregate, and not in his other aggregates beginning with materiality.

<p><a name="XXII.87" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.87" ><b class="bfseries">§87.</b></a></a>  For when a great tree is growing on the earth’s surface supported by the essences of humus and water and, with that as condition, increases its roots, trunks, branches, twigs, shoots, foliage, flowers, and fruit, till it fills the sky, and continues the tree’s lineage through the succession of the seed up till the end of the eon, it cannot be said that the essence of humus, etc., are found only in its root and not in the trunk, etc., … that they are only in the fruit and not in the root, etc., Why?

<p><a name="XXII.88" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.88" ><b class="bfseries">§88.</b></a></a>  But some man who felt revulsion for that same tree’s flowers, fruits, etc., might puncture it on four sides with the poison thorn called “<em>maṇḍūka</em> thorn,” and then the tree, being poisoned, would be no more able to prolong its continuity since it would have become barren with the contamination of the essences of humus and water. <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{778|720}</small></span>So too the clansman who feels revulsion (dispassion) for the occurrence of the aggregates, undertakes to develop the four paths in his own continuity which is like the man’s application of poison to the tree on all four sides. Then the continuity of his aggregates is rendered incapable of prolonging the continuity to a subsequent becoming. It is now unproductive of future becoming since all kinds of kamma beginning with bodily kamma are now merely functional: for the effect of the four paths’ poison has entirely exterminated the defilements that are the root of the round. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[689]</i></span> Being without clinging, he inevitably attains with the cessation of the last consciousness the complete extinction [of Nibbāna], like a fire with no more fuel.

<p><a name="XXII.89" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.89" ><b class="bfseries">§89.</b></a></a>  Besides these there are four other ways of classing “arisen,” namely, (v) arisen as happening, (vi) arisen with apprehension of an object, (vii) arisen through non-suppression, (viii) arisen through non-abolition. </p>
<p>Herein, (v) <em>arisen as happening</em> is the same as (i) “arisen as actually occurring.” </p>
<p>(vi) When an object has at some previous time come into focus in the eye, etc., and defilement did not arise then but arose in full force later on simply because the object had been apprehended, then that defilement is called <em>arisen with apprehension of an object</em>. Like the defilement that arose in the Elder Mahā-Tissa after seeing the form of a person of the opposite sex while wandering for alms in the village of Kalyāna (cf. <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	]
</span>I 4</b>). </p>
<p>(vii) As long as a defilement is not suppressed by either serenity or insight, though it may not have actually entered the conscious continuity, it is nevertheless called <em>arisen through non-suppression</em> because there is no cause to prevent its arising [if suitable conditions combine]. (viii) But even when they are suppressed by serenity or insight they are still called <em>arisen through non-abolition</em> because the necessity for their arising has not been transcended unless they have been cut off by the path. Like the elder who had obtained the eight attainments, and the defilements that arose in him while he was going through the air on his hearing the sound of a woman singing with a sweet voice as she was gathering flowers in a grove of blossoming trees. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.90" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.90" ><b class="bfseries">§90.</b></a></a>  And the three kinds, namely, (vi) arisen with apprehension of an object, (vii) arisen through non-suppression, and (vii) arisen through non-abolition, should be understood as included by (iv) arisen by having soil [to grow in]. </p>
<p><a name="XXII.91" ><a href="ch-29.html#XXII.91" ><b class="bfseries">§91.</b></a></a>  So as regard the kinds of “arisen” stated, the four kinds, namely, (i) as actually occurring, (ii) as been and gone, (iii) by opportunity made, and (v) as happening, cannot be abandoned by any [of these four kinds of] knowledge because they cannot be eliminated by the paths. But the four kinds of “arisen,” namely, (iv) by having soil [to grow in], (vi) with apprehension of an object, (vii) through non-suppression, and (viii) through non-abolition, can all be abandoned because a given mundane or supramundane knowledge, when it arises, nullifies a given one of these modes of being arisen. </p>

<p>(8) <em>Contemplation of destruction</em>, however, is the knowledge in one who effects the resolution of the compact and so sees destruction as “impermanent in the <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{784|726}</small></span>sense of destruction.” Through the means of that knowledge there comes to be the abandoning of the perception of compactness. </p>

<p>It is intentness on cessation, in other words, on that same dissolution, after seeing dissolution of [both seen and unseen] formations by personal experience and by inference [respectively].

<p>Insight so described occurs after knowing materiality, etc., as object, by seeing the dissolution both of that object and of the consciousness whose object it was, and by apprehending voidness through the dissolution in this way: “Only formations break up.

<p>Abandoning by substitution of the opposites should be understood in detail in this way. But in the texts it is stated in brief thus: “Abandoning of views by substitution of opposites comes about in one who develops concentration partaking of penetration” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
