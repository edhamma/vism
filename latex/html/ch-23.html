<h1 id="a0000000286">1 A. Description of the Faculties</h1>
<p><a name="XVI.1" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.1" ><b class="bfseries">§1.</b></a></a>  <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{561|503}</small></span><span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[491]</i></span> The “faculties” listed next to the elements (<a href="ch-21.html#XIV.32" >XIV.32</a>) are the twenty-two faculties, namely, eye faculty, ear faculty, nose faculty, tongue faculty, body faculty, mind faculty, femininity faculty, masculinity faculty, life faculty, [bodily] pleasure faculty, [bodily] pain faculty, [mental] joy faculty, [mental] grief faculty, equanimity faculty, faith faculty, energy faculty, mindfulness faculty, concentration faculty, understanding faculty, “I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown” faculty, final-knowledge faculty, final-knower faculty. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.2" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.2" ><b class="bfseries">§2.</b></a></a>  Herein: </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> (l) As to meaning, (2) character and so on,<br /> (3) Order, (4) divided and undivided,<br /> (5) Likewise function, and (6) also plane—<br /> The exposition should be known. </blockquote>
<p><a name="XVI.3" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.3" ><b class="bfseries">§3.</b></a></a>  <em>1.</em> Herein, firstly, the <em>meaning </em>of eye, etc., is explained in the way beginning: “It relishes (<em>cakkhati</em>), thus it is an eye (<em>cakkhu</em>)” (<a href="ch-22.html#XV.3" >XV.3</a>). But as regards the last three, the first is called the “I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown” faculty because it arises in the initial stage [of the stream-entry path moment] in one who has entered on the way thus “I shall come to know the deathless state, or the Dhamma of the Four (Noble) Truths, not known,”<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000948">
  <sup class="footnotemark">1</sup>
</a> and because it carries the meaning of faculty (rulership). The second of them is called the final-knowledge faculty because of knowing finally, and because it carries the meaning of faculty. The third is called the final-knower faculty because it arises in one who has destroyed cankers, who possesses final knowledge, and whose task of getting to know the four truths is finished, and because it carries the meaning of faculty. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.4" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  But what is this meaning of faculty (rulership—<em>indriyattha</em>) that they have? (a) The meaning of being the mark of a ruler (<em>inda</em>) is the meaning of faculty (rulership). (b) The meaning of being taught by a ruler is the meaning of faculty, (c) The meaning of being seen by a ruler is the meaning of faculty, (d) The meaning of having been prepared by a ruler is the meaning of faculty, (e) The <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{562|504}</small></span>meaning of having been fostered by a ruler is the meaning of faculty.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000949">
  <sup class="footnotemark">2</sup>
</a> And all that applies here in one instance or another. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.5" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.5" ><b class="bfseries">§5.</b></a></a>  The Blessed One, Fully Enlightened, is a ruler (<em>inda</em>) because of supreme lordship. And so is kamma, profitable and unprofitable; for no one has lordship over the kinds of kamma. So here, the faculties (<em>indriya</em>), <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[492]</i></span> which are created by kamma, <em>are the mark </em>of profitable and unprofitable kamma. And since they are <em>prepared </em>by it, they are faculties in the sense of (a) <em>being the mark of a ruler </em>and (d) in the sense of <em>having been prepared by a ruler. </em>But since they have also been correctly made evident and disclosed by the Blessed One, they are all faculties (b) in the sense of <em>being taught by a ruler </em>and (c) in the sense of <em>being seen by a ruler</em>. And since some of them were cultivated by the Blessed One, Ruler of Sages, in his cultivation of domain and some in his cultivation of development, they are faculties (e) in the sense of <em>being fostered by a ruler</em>. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.6" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.6" ><b class="bfseries">§6.</b></a></a>  Furthermore, they are faculties (rulership) in the sense of lordship called predominance. For predominance of the eye, etc., is implied in the occurrence of eye-consciousness, etc., because of the (consciousness’) keenness when that [faculty] is keen and slowness when it is slow. </p>
<p>This, firstly, is the exposition as to meaning. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.7" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.7" ><b class="bfseries">§7.</b></a></a>  <em>2. As to character and so on</em>: the meaning is that the exposition of the eye and so on should be known according to characteristic, function, manifestation, proximate cause, and so on. But these characteristics, etc., of theirs are given above in the Description of the Aggregates (<a href="ch-21.html#XIV.37" >XIV.37ff.</a>). For the four beginning with the understanding faculty are simply non-delusion as to meaning. The rest are each given there as such. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.8" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.8" ><b class="bfseries">§8.</b></a></a>  <em>3. As to order: </em>this too is only order of teaching (see <a href="ch-21.html#XIV.211" >XIV.211</a>). Herein, the noble plane [which is the stage of stream-entry, etc.] is attained through the full-understanding of internal states, and so the eye faculty and the rest included in the selfhood are taught first. Then the femininity faculty and masculinity faculty, to show on what account that selfhood is called “woman” or “man.” Next, the life faculty, to make it known that although that selfhood is twofold, still its existence is bound up with the life faculty. Next the [bodily-] pleasure faculty, etc., to make it known that there is no remission of these feelings as long as that [selfhood] continues, and that all feeling is [ultimately] suffering. Next, the faith faculty, etc., to show the way, since these things are to be developed in order to make that [suffering] cease. Next, the “I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown” faculty to show that the way is not sterile, since it is through this way that this state is first manifested in oneself. Next, the final-knowledge faculty, because it is the fruit of the last-mentioned faculty and so must be developed after it. Next, the final-knower faculty, the supreme reward, is taught last to make it known that it <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{563|505}</small></span>is attained by development, and that when it is attained there is nothing more to be done. This is the order here.<b class="bfseries"> </b><span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[493]</i></span> </p>
<p><a name="XVI.9" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.9" ><b class="bfseries">§9.</b></a></a>  <em>4. As to divided and undivided</em>: here there is only division of the life faculty; for that is twofold as the material-life faculty and the immaterial-life faculty. There is no division of the others. </p>
<p>This is how the exposition should be known here as to divided and undivided. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.10" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.10" ><b class="bfseries">§10.</b></a></a>  <em>5. As to function: </em>what is the faculties’ function? Firstly, because of the words “The eye base is a condition, as faculty condition, for the eye-consciousness element and for the states associated therewith” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Paṭṭh" >Paṭṭh</a>
	]
</span></b> 1.5) the eye faculty’s function is to cause by its own keenness, slowness, etc., the occurrence of eye-consciousness and associated states, etc., in a mode parallel to its own,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000950">
  <sup class="footnotemark">3</sup>
</a> which is called their keenness, slowness, etc., this function being accomplishable through the state of faculty condition. So too in the case of the ear, nose, tongue, and body. But the function of the mind faculty is to make conascent states subject to its own mastery. That of the life faculty is to maintain conascent states. That of the femininity faculty and the masculinity faculty is to allot the modes of the mark, sign, work and ways of women and men. That of the faculties of pleasure, pain, joy, and grief is to govern conascent states and impart their own particular mode of grossness to those states. That of the equanimity faculty is to impart to them the mode of quiet, superiority and neutrality. That of the faculties of faith, etc., is to overcome opposition and to impart to associated states the mode of confidence and so on. That of the “I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown” faculty is both to abandon three fetters and to confront associated states with the abandonment of them. That of the final-knowledge faculty is both to attenuate and abandon respectively lust, ill will, etc., and to subject conascent states to its own mastery. That of the final-knower faculty is both to abandon endeavour in all functions and to condition associated states by confronting them with the Deathless. </p>
<p>This is how the exposition should be known here as to function. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.11" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.11" ><b class="bfseries">§11.</b></a></a>  <em>6. As to plane</em>: the faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, femininity, masculinity, pleasure, pain, and grief are of the sense sphere only. The mind faculty, life faculty, and equanimity faculty, and the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and understanding are included in the four planes. The joy faculty is included in three planes, namely, sense sphere, fine-material sphere, and supramundane. The last three are supramundane only. This is how the exposition should be known here as to plane. </p>

	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>

Origin’s meaning of accumulating, meaning of source, meaning of bondage, meaning of impeding … Cessation’s meaning of escape, meaning of seclusion, meaning of being unformed, meaning of deathlessness … The path’s meaning of outlet, meaning of cause, meaning of seeing, meaning of predominance, these are the path’s meanings of path, which are real, not unreal, not otherwise” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Paṭis" >Paṭis</a>

<p><a name="XVI.16" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  <em>2. As to derivation, </em>3. <em>division by character, et cetera: </em>here, however, firstly “as to derivation” [of the word <em>dukkha </em>(suffering):] the word <em>du </em>(“bad”) is met with in the sense of vile (<em>kucchita</em>); for they call a vile child a <em>du-putta </em>(“bad child”). The word <em>kham </em>(“-ness”), however is met with in the sense of empty (<em>tuccha</em>), for they call empty space “<em>kham</em>.” And the first truth is vile because it is the haunt of many dangers, and it is empty because it is devoid of the lastingness, beauty, pleasure, and self conceived by rash people. So it is called <em>dukkhaṃ </em>(“badness” = suffering, pain), because of vileness and emptiness. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[495]</i></span> </p>
<p><a name="XVI.17" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.17" ><b class="bfseries">§17.</b></a></a>  [<em>Samudaya </em>(origin):] the word <em>sam </em>(= prefix “con-”) denotes connection, as in the words <em>samāgama </em>(concourse, coming together), <em>sameta </em>(congregated, gone together), and so on. The word <em>u </em>denotes rising up, as in the words <em>uppanna </em>(arisen, uprisen), <em>udita </em>(ascended, gone up), and so on. The word <em>aya</em><a class="footnote" href="#a0000000951">
  <sup class="footnotemark">4</sup>
</a> denotes a <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{565|507}</small></span>reason (<em>kāraṇa</em>). And this second truth is the reason for the arising of suffering when combined with the remaining conditions. So it is called <em>dukkha-samudaya </em>(the origin of suffering) because it is the reason in combination for the arising of suffering. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.18" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.18" ><b class="bfseries">§18.</b></a></a>  [<em>Nirodha </em>(cessation):] the word <em>ni </em>denotes absence, and the word <em>rodha</em>, a prison.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000952">

</a> Now, the third truth is void of all destinies [by rebirth] and so there is no constraint (<em>rodha</em>) of suffering here reckoned as the prison of the round of rebirths; or when that cessation has been arrived at, there is no more constraint of suffering reckoned as the prison of the round of rebirths. And being the opposite of that prison, it is called <em>dukkha-nirodha </em>(cessation of suffering). Or alternatively, it is called “cessation of suffering” because it is a condition for the cessation of suffering consisting in non-arising. </p>

The suffering consisting in crying out by one who is unable to bear that is <em>lamentation. </em>Next, the suffering consisting in affliction of the body due to the contact of undesirable tangible data, in other words, disturbance of the elements, is <em>pain</em>. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[506]</i></span> The suffering oppressing the mind through resistance to that in ordinary people oppressed by it, is <em>grief. </em>The suffering consisting in brooding<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000961">

<p>This is the exposition of the aggregates [as objects] of clinging. This, firstly, is the method for the description of suffering. </p>

[As regards the expression] <em>produces further becoming</em>: it is a making become again, thus it is “becoming again” (<em>punabbhava</em>); becoming again is its habit, thus it “produces further becoming” (<em>ponobbhavika</em>). The expression <em>nandirāgasahagatā </em>(accompanied by concern and greed) = <em>nandirāgena </em><span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{577|519}</small></span><em>sahagatā</em>; what is meant is that it is identical in meaning with delight and greed. <em>Concerned with this and that</em>: wherever personality is generated there is concern with that. The expression <em>that is to say </em>(<em>seyyathidaṃ</em>) is a particle; its meaning is “which is that.” <em>Craving for sense desires, craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming </em>will be explained in the Description of Dependent Origination (<a href="ch-24.html#XVII.233" >XVII.233ff.</a>). Although this is threefold, it should nevertheless be understood as “the noble truth of the origin of suffering,” taking it as one in the sense of its generating the truth of suffering. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000302">2.3 The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering</h2>
<p><a name="XVI.62" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.62" ><b class="bfseries">§62.</b></a></a>  In the description of the <em>cessation </em>of suffering it is the cessation of the origin that is stated by the words <em>that which is … of that same craving</em>, and so on. Why is that? Because the cessation of suffering comes about with the cessation of its origin. For it is with the cessation of its origin that suffering ceases, not otherwise. Hence it is said: <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[507]</i></span> </p>
<blockquote class="verse"> “Just as a tree cut down grows up again<br /> While yet its root remains unharmed and sound,<br /> So with the tendency to crave intact<br /> This suffering is ever reproduced” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XVI.63" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.63" ><b class="bfseries">§63.</b></a></a>  So it is because suffering ceases only through the cessation of its origin that, when teaching the cessation of suffering, the Blessed One therefore taught the cessation of the origin. For the Perfect Ones behave like lions.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000962">
  <sup class="footnotemark">15</sup>
</a> When they make suffering cease and when they teach the cessation of suffering, they deal with the cause, not the fruit. But the sectarians behave like dogs. When they make suffering cease and when they teach the cessation of suffering, by teaching devotion to self-mortification, etc., they deal with the fruit, not the cause. This, in the first place, is how the motive for teaching the cessation of suffering by means of the cessation of its origin should be understood. </p>

<p><a name="XVI.67" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.67" ><b class="bfseries">§67.</b></a></a>  [Question 1] Is Nibbāna non-existent because it is unapprehendable, like the hare’s horn? <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{579|521}</small></span>[Answer] That is not so, because it is apprehendable by the [right] means. For it is apprehendable [by some, namely, the nobles ones] by the [right] means, in other words, by the way that is appropriate to it, [the way of virtue, concentration, and understanding]; it is like the supramundane consciousness of others, [which is apprehendable only by certain of the Noble Ones] by means of knowledge of penetration of others’ minds. Therefore it should not be said that it is non-existent because unapprehendable; for it should not be said that what the foolish ordinary man does not apprehend is unapprehendable. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.68" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.68" ><b class="bfseries">§68.</b></a></a>  Again, it should not be said that Nibbāna does not exist. Why not? Because it then follows that the way would be futile. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[508]</i></span> For if Nibbāna were non-existent, then it would follow that the right way, which includes the three aggregates beginning with virtue and is headed by right understanding, would be futile. And it is not futile because it does reach Nibbāna. </p>
<p>[Q. 2] But futility of the way does not follow because what is reached is absence, [that is, absence of the five aggregates consequent upon the cutting off of the defilements]. </p>
<p>[A.] That is not so. Because, though there is absence of past and future [aggregates], there is nevertheless no reaching of Nibbāna [simply because of that]. </p>
<p>[Q. 3] Then is the absence of present [aggregates] as well Nibbāna? </p>
<p>[A.] That is not so. Because their absence is an impossibility, since if they are absent their non-presence follows. [Besides, if Nibbāna were absence of present aggregates too,] that would entail the fault of excluding the arising of the Nibbāna element with result of past clinging left, at the path moment, which has present aggregates as its support. </p>
<p>[Q. 4] Then will there be no fault if it is non-presence of defilements [that is Nibbāna]? </p>
<p>[A.] That is not so. Because it would then follow that the noble path was meaningless. For if it were so, then, since defilements [can be] non-existent also before the moment of the noble path, it follows that the noble path would be meaningless. Consequently that is no reason; [it is unreasonable to say that Nibbāna is unapprehendable, that it is non-existence, and so on]. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.69" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.69" ><b class="bfseries">§69.</b></a></a>  [Q. 5] But is not Nibbāna destruction, because of the passage beginning, “That, friend, which is the destruction of greed … [of hate … of delusion … is Nibbāna]?” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>

</span>IV 251</b>). </p>
<p>[A.] That is not so, because it would follow that Arahantship also was mere destruction. For that too is described in the [same] way beginning, “That, friend, which is the destruction of greed … of hate … of delusion … is Arahantship]” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>IV 252</b>). </p>
<p>And what is more, the fallacy then follows that Nibbāna would be temporary, etc.; for if it were so, it would follow that Nibbāna would be temporary, have the characteristic of being formed, and be obtainable regardless of right effort; and precisely because of its having formed characteristics it would be included in <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{580|522}</small></span>the formed, and it would be burning with the fires of greed, etc., and because of its burning it would follow that it was suffering. </p>
<p>[Q. 6] Is there no fallacy if Nibbāna is that kind of destruction subsequent to which there is no more occurrence? </p>
<p>[A.] That is not so. Because there is no such kind of destruction. And even if there were, the aforesaid fallacies would not be avoided. </p>
<p>Also because it would follow that the noble path was Nibbāna. For the noble path causes the destruction of defects, and that is why it is called “destruction”; and subsequent to that there is no more occurrence of the defects. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.70" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.70" ><b class="bfseries">§70.</b></a></a>  But it is because the kind of destruction called “cessation consisting in non-arising,” [that is, Nibbāna,] serves figuratively speaking as decisive-support [for the path] that [Nibbāna] is called “destruction” as a metaphor for it. </p>
<p>[Q. 7] Why is it not stated in its own form? </p>
<p>[A.] Because of its extreme subtlety. And its extreme subtlety is established because it inclined the Blessed One to inaction, [that is, to not teaching the Dhamma (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[

<p>[Q. 8] Since it is, when the path is, then it is not uncreated. </p>
<p>[A.] That is not so, because it is not arousable by the path; it is only reachable, not arousable, by the path; that is why it is uncreated. It is because it is uncreated that it is free from ageing and death. It is because of the absence of its creation and of its ageing and death that it is permanent. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[509]</i></span> </p>
<p><a name="XVI.72" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.72" ><b class="bfseries">§72.</b></a></a>  [Q. 9] Then it follows that Nibbāna, too, has the kind of permanence [claimed] of the atom and so on. </p>
<p>[A.] That is not so. Because of the absence of any cause [that brings about its arising]. </p>
<p>[Q. 10] Because Nibbāna has permanence, then, these [that is, the atom, etc.] are permanent as well. </p>
<p>[A.] That is not so. Because [in that proposition] the characteristic of [logical] cause does not arise. [In other words, to say that Nibbāna is permanent is not to assert a reason why the atom, etc., should be permanent] </p>
<p>[Q. 11] Then they are permanent because of the absence of their arising, as Nibbāna is. </p>
<p>[A.] That is not so. Because the atom and so on have not been established as facts. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.73" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.73" ><b class="bfseries">§73.</b></a></a>  The aforesaid logical reasoning proves that only this [that is, Nibbāna] is permanent [precisely because it is uncreated]; and it is immaterial because it transcends the individual essence of matter. </p>
<p>The Buddhas’ goal is one and has no plurality. But this [single goal, Nibbāna,] is firstly called <em>with result of past clinging left </em>since it is made known together with the [aggregates resulting from past] clinging still remaining [during the Arahant’s life], being thus made known in terms of the stilling of defilement <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{581|523}</small></span>and the remaining [result of past] clinging that are present in one who has reached it by means of development. But [secondly, it is called <em>without result of past clinging left</em>] since after the last consciousness of the Arahant, who has abandoned arousing [future aggregates] and so prevented kamma from giving result in a future [existence], there is no further arising of aggregates of existence, and those already arisen have disappeared. So the [result of past] clinging that remained is non-existent; and it is in terms of this non-existence, in the sense that “there is no [result of past] clinging here” that that [same goal is called] <em>without result of past clinging left </em>(see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<p><a name="XVI.96" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.96" ><b class="bfseries">§96.</b></a></a>  For here the three beginning with right speech are virtue and so they are included in the virtue aggregate, being of the same kind. For although in the text the description is given in the locative case as “in the virtue aggregate,” still the meaning should be understood according to the instrumental case [that is, “by the virtue aggregate.”] </p>
<p>As to the three beginning with right effort, concentration cannot of its own nature cause absorption through unification on the object; but with energy accomplishing its function of exerting and mindfulness accomplishing its function of preventing wobbling, it can do so. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.97" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.97" ><b class="bfseries">§97.</b></a></a>  Here is a simile: three friends, [thinking,] “We will celebrate the festival,” entered a park.

But although standing on the other’s back, he still could not pick them because of his unsteadiness. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[515]</i></span> Then the third offered his shoulder [as support]. So standing on the back of the one and supporting himself on the other’s shoulder, he picked as many flowers as he wanted and after adorning himself, he went and enjoyed the festival. And so it is with this. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.98" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.98" ><b class="bfseries">§98.</b></a></a>  For the three states beginning with right effort, which are born together, are like the three friends who enter the park together. The object is like the champak tree in full blossom. Concentration, which cannot of its own nature bring about absorption by unification on the object, is like the man who could not pick the flower by raising his arm. Effort is like the companion who bent down, giving his back to mount upon. Mindfulness is like the friend who stood by, giving his shoulder for support. Just as standing on the back of the one and supporting himself on the other’s shoulder he could pick as many flowers as he wanted, so too, when energy accomplishes its function of exerting and when mindfulness accomplishes its function of preventing wobbling, with the help so obtained concentration can bring about absorption by unification on the object. So here in the concentration aggregate it is only concentration that is included as of the same kind. But effort and mindfulness are included because of their action [in assisting]. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.99" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.99" ><b class="bfseries">§99.</b></a></a>  Also as regards right view and right thinking, understanding cannot of its own nature define an object as impermanent, painful, not-self.

<p><a name="XVI.100" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.100" ><b class="bfseries">§100.</b></a></a>  How? Just as a money changer, having a coin placed in his hand and being desirous of looking at it on all sides equally, cannot turn it over with the power of his eye only, but by turning it over with his fingers he is able to look at it on all sides, similarly understanding cannot of its own nature define an object as impermanent and so on. But [assisted] by applied thought with its characteristic of directing the mind on to [the object] and its function of striking and threshing, as it were, hitting and turning over, it can take anything given and define it. So here in the understanding aggregate it is only right view that is included as of the same kind. But right thinking is included because of its action [in assisting]. </p>
<p><a name="XVI.101" ><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.101" ><b class="bfseries">§101.</b></a></a>  So the path is included by the three aggregates. Hence it was said that it is of three kinds classed according to the three aggregates. And it is of four kinds as the path of stream-entry and so on. </p>

Something must be said here about the words <em>dukkha</em> and <em>sukha,</em> the former being perhaps the hardest after <em>dhamma</em> to render into English. <em>Dukkha</em> is consistently rendered by either the vaguer general term “suffering” or by the more specific “[bodily] pain.” Different, but overlapping, ideas are expressed. The latter needs no explanation; but “suffering” must be stretched to include the general insecurity of the whole of experience, of the impermanent world. For this, “uneasiness” would certainly be preferable (“ill” is sometimes used), but multiplication of renderings is to be avoided as much as possible; local accuracy is only too often gained at the cost of general disorientation in a work of this sort, with these very general words capable of sharp focusing. Again, <em>sukha</em> has been rendered as either “bliss” or “pleasure,” though the latter does not at all necessarily imply any hedonism construed with sensual pleasure (<em>kāma</em>). Again, “ease” (in the sense of relief) is in many ways preferable for the first sense but has not been used for the reason already given.</li>

The <em>Sammohavinodanī</em> (commentary on the Āyatana-Vibhaṅga Abhidhamma-bhājaniya) refutes the suggestion of a disputant (<em>vitaṇḍavādin</em>) who asserts that Nibbāna is “mere destruction” (<em>khayamatta</em>). The arguments used are merely supplementary to those in §69 here, and so are not quoted. The conclusion of the argument is worth noting, however, because of the emphasis on the words “<em>taṃ āgamma</em>.” It is this: “It is on coming to Nibbāna that greed, etc., are destroyed. It is the same Nibbāna that is called ‘destruction of greed, destruction of hate, destruction of delusion.’ These are just three terms for Nibbāna—When this was said, he asked: You say ‘On coming to’ (<em>āgamma</em>); from where have you got this ‘on coming to’?—It is got from the Suttas—Quote the sutta—‘Thus ignorance and craving, on coming to that, are destroyed in that, are abolished in that, nor does anything anywhere … (<em>evaṃ avijjā ca taṇhā ca taṃ āgamma tamhi khīṇaṃ tamhi bhaggaṃ na ca kiñci kadāci</em> … ).’ When this was said, the other was silent.” The quotation has not been traced.</li>

What a man feels that he perceives. What he perceives he thinks about. What he thinks about he diversifies (<em>papañceti</em>). Owing to his having diversified, the evaluation of diversifying perceptions besets a man with respect to past, future, and present visible objects,” and so on. This kind of <em>papañca</em> is explained by the Commentaries as “due to craving, pride and views” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>I 65</b>), exercised by craving, etc., on the bare material supplied by perception and thought. Consequently, though it is bound up with craving, etc., a false emphasis is given in rendering <em>papañca</em> in these contexts by “obsession” as is done in PED. <em>Nippapañca</em> as a term for Nibbāna emphasizes the absence of that.</li>
  <li id="a0000000965"><a name="XVI.n18" ></a><a href="ch-23.html#XVI.n18" ><sup>¶</sup></a> This discussion falls under three headings: Questions one to four refute the assertion that Nibbāna is mythical and non-existent; questions five to seven refute the assertion that Nibbāna is “mere destruction;” (further argued in the <em>Sammohavinodanī—</em><b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

The <em>Paramatthamañjūsā</em> (Vism-mhṭ) covers the subject at great length and reinforces the arguments given here with much syllogistic reasoning. However, only the following paragraph will be quoted here, which is reproduced in the commentaries to <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>37</b>. (The last sentence marked ** appears only in the Udāna Commentary. Readings vary considerably): 
“Now, in the ultimate sense the existingness of the Nibbāna-element has been demonstrated by the Fully Enlightened One, compassionate for the whole world, by many sutta passages such as ‘Dhammas without condition,’ ‘Unformed dhammas’ (see <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</span>80</b>). So even if the wise trust completely in the Dispensation and have no doubts, though they may not yet have had direct perception of it, nevertheless there are persons who come to understand through another’s guidance (reading <em>paraneyya-buddhino</em>); and the intention here is that this logical reasoning under the heading of deduction (<em>niddhāraṇa</em>) should be for the purpose of removing their doubts. 
“Just as it is owing to full-understanding (reading <em>yathā pariññeyyatāya</em>) that from the sense desires and from materiality, etc (reading <em>rūpādīnaṃ</em>), that have something beyond them, there is made known an escape [from them] that is their opposite and whose individual essence is devoid of them, so there must exist an escape that is the opposite of, and whose individual essence is devoid of, all formed dhammas, all of which have the aforesaid individual essence (reading <em>evaṃ taṃ-sabhāvānaṃ</em>), and it is this escape that is the unformed element. 
“Besides, insight knowledge, which has formed dhammas as its object, and also conformity knowledge, abandon the defilements with the abandoning consisting in substitution of opposites, being unable to abandon them with the abandoning consisting in cutting off. Likewise, the kind of knowledge that has conventional truth (<em>sammuti-sacca</em>) [that is, concepts] as its object, in the first jhāna, etc., abandons the defilements only with the abandoning consisting in suppression, not by cutting them off. So, because the kind of knowledge that has formed dhammas as its object and that which has conventional truth as its object are both incapable of abandoning defilements by cutting them off, there must [consequently] exist an object for the noble-path-knowledge that effects their abandonment by cutting them off, [which object must be] of a kind opposite to both. And it is this that is the unformed element. 
“Likewise, the words, ‘Bhikkhus, there is an unborn, an unbecome, an unmade, an unformed’ and so on, which demonstrate the existingness of Nibbāna in the ultimate sense, are not misleading because they are spoken by the Blessed One, like the words, ‘All formations are impermanent, all formations are painful, all <em>dhammas </em>(states) are not self’ (Dhp 277–79; <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#A" >A</a>
	]
</span>I 286</b>, etc.). 
“Likewise, in certain instances as regards scope, the word ‘Nibbāna’ has the correct ultimate meaning for its scope [precisely] because of the existence of its use as a mere metaphor—like the word ‘lion’ (see <a href="ch-22.html#XV.n12" >Ch. XV, note 12</a>, for the word lion). *Or alternatively, the unformed element exists in the ultimate sense also, because its individual essence is the opposite of, is free from, that of the other kind [of element such as] the earth element and feeling*” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#Vism-mhṭ" >Vism-mhṭ</a>
	]
</span>534–540</b>). The Pali of the last two paragraphs is taken to read thus: 
“<em>Tathā ‘atthi bhikkhave ajātaṃ abhūtaṃ akataṃ asaṅkhatan’ ti idaṃ nibbāna-padassa paramatthato atthibhāva-jotakaṃ vacanaṃ aviparītatthaṃ bhagavatā kathitattā; yaṃ hi bhagavatā bhāsitaṃ taṃ aviparitatthaṃ yathā taṃ ‘sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā sabbe dhammā anattā’ ti.</em> 
<em>“Tathā nibbāna-saddo katthaci (pi) visaye yathābhūta-paramatthavisayo upacāravuttimatta-sabhāvato (pi) seyyathā pi sīha-saddo. *Atha vā atth’eva paramatthato asaṅkhata-dhātu itaraṃ tabbiparītavimutta-sabhāvattā seyyathā pi pathavī-dhātu vedanā vā ti.</em>”* 
The discussion is summarized and additional arguments are added in the <em>Abhidhammāvatāra</em>. The later <em>Abhidhammatthasaṅgaha</em> appears to have shelved the problem. It may be noted that in the whole of this discussion (particularly in the answer to Q. 4) no mention is made of the abandoning of the inherent tendencies (<em>anusaya</em>) in the attainment of Nibbāna (see, e.g., MN 64; <b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

All dhammas whether grouped together In three ways, two ways, or one way, Are void: thus here in this dispensation Do those who know voidness make their comment. 
“How so? Firstly, all mundane dhammas are void of lastingness, beauty, pleasure, and self because they are destitute of lastingness, beauty, pleasure, and self. Path and fruition dhammas are void of lastingness, pleasure, and self, because they are destitute of lastingness, pleasure, and self. Nibbāna dhammas (pl.) are void of self because of the non-existence (<em>abhāva</em>) of self. [Secondly,] formed dhammas, both mundane and supramundane, are all void of a [permanent] living being (<em>satta</em>) because of the non-existence of [such] a living being of any sort whatever. The unformed dhamma (sing.) is void of formations because of the non-existence (<em>abhāva: </em>or absence) of those formations too. [Thirdly,] all dhammas formed and unformed are void of self because of the non-existence of any person (<em>puggala</em>) called ‘self’ (<em>attā</em>).”</li>
