<p><a name="XX.2" ><a href="ch-27.html#XX.2" ><b class="bfseries">§2.</b></a></a>  One who desires to accomplish this should first of all apply himself to the inductive insight called “comprehension by groups.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000001037">
  <sup class="footnotemark">1</sup>
</a>” Why? Because knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path appears in connection with the appearance of illumination, etc. (<a href="ch-27.html#XX.105" >XX.105f.</a>) in one who has begun insight. For it is after illumination, etc., have appeared in one who has already begun insight that there comes to be knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path. And comprehension by groups is the beginning of insight. That is why it is set forth next to the overcoming of doubt. Besides, knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path arises when “full-understanding as investigation” is occurring, and full-understanding as investigation comes next to full-understanding as the known (see <a href="ch-26.html#XIX.21" >XIX.21</a>). So this is also a reason why one who desires to accomplish this purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path should first of all apply himself to comprehension by groups. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000353">1.2 The Three Kinds of Full-Understanding</h2>
<p><a name="XX.3" ><a href="ch-27.html#XX.3" ><b class="bfseries">§3.</b></a></a>  Here is the exposition: there are three kinds of mundane full-understanding, that is, full-understanding as the known, full-understanding as investigation, and full-understanding as abandoning, with reference to which it was said: “Understanding that is direct-knowledge is knowledge in the sense of being known. Understanding that is full-understanding is knowledge in the sense of <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{690|632}</small></span>investigating. Understanding that is abandoning is knowledge in the sense of giving up” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[

</span>I 87</b>). </p>
<p>Herein, the understanding that occurs by observing the specific characteristics of such and such states thus, “Materiality (<em>rūpa</em>) has the characteristic of being molested (<em>ruppana</em>); feeling has the characteristic of being felt,” is called <em>full-understanding as the known. </em>The understanding consisting in insight with the general characteristics as its object that occurs in attributing a general characteristic to those same states in the way beginning, “Materiality is impermanent, <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[607]</i></span> feeling is impermanent” is called <em>full-understanding as investigation.</em><a class="footnote" href="#a0000001038">
  <sup class="footnotemark">2</sup>
</a> The understanding consisting in insight with the characteristics as its object that occurs as the abandoning of the perception of permanence, etc., in those same states is called<em> full-understanding as abandoning</em>. </p>
<p><a name="XX.4" ><a href="ch-27.html#XX.4" ><b class="bfseries">§4.</b></a></a>  Herein, the plane of <em>full-understanding as the known </em>extends from the delimitation of formations (<a href="ch-25.html#XVIII" >Ch. XVIII</a>) up to the discernment of conditions (Ch. XIX); for in this interval the penetration of the specific characteristics of states predominates. The plane of <em>full-understanding as investigation </em>extends from comprehension by groups up to contemplation of rise and fall (<a href="ch-28.html#XXI.3" >XXI.3f.</a>); for in this interval the penetration of the general characteristics predominates. The plane of <em>full-understanding as abandoning </em>extends from contemplation of dissolution onwards (<a href="ch-28.html#XXI.10" >XXI.10</a>); for from there onwards the seven contemplations that effect the abandoning of the perception of permanence, etc., predominate thus: </p>
<p>(1) Contemplating [formations] as impermanent, a man abandons the perception of permanence. </p>
<p>(2) Contemplating [them] as painful, he abandons the perception of pleasure. </p>
<p>(3) Contemplating [them] as not-self, he abandons the perception of self. </p>
<p>(4) Becoming dispassionate, he abandons delighting. </p>
<p>(5) Causing fading away, he abandons greed. </p>
<p>(6) Causing cessation, he abandons originating. </p>
<p>(7) Relinquishing, he abandons grasping (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

<h2 id="a0000000356">2.2 Comprehension by Groups—Application of Text</h2>
<p><a name="XX.13" ><a href="ch-27.html#XX.13" ><b class="bfseries">§13.</b></a></a>  Here is the application of the directions dealing with the aggregates: “Any materiality whatever, (i–iii) whether past, future, or present, (iv–v) internal or <span style="color:#007F7F"><small class="footnotesize">{694|636}</small></span>external, (vi–vii) gross or subtle, (viii–ix) inferior or superior, (x-xi) far or near—he defines all materiality as impermanent: this is one kind of comprehension. He defines it as painful: <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[610]</i></span> this is one kind of comprehension. He defines it as not-self: this is one kind of comprehension” (see <a href="ch-27.html#XX.6" >§6</a>). At this point this bhikkhu [takes] all materiality, which is described without specifying as “<em>any materiality whatever</em>,” and having delimited it in the eleven instances, namely, with the past triad and with the four dyads beginning with the internal dyad, he “<em>defines all materiality as impermanent</em>,” he comprehends that it is impermanent. How? In the way stated next. For this is said: “<em>Materiality, whether past, future or present, is impermanent in the sense of destruction</em>.” </p>
<p><a name="XX.14" ><a href="ch-27.html#XX.14" ><b class="bfseries">§14.</b></a></a>  Accordingly, he comprehends the materiality that is past as “<em>impermanent in the sense of destruction” </em>because it was destroyed in the past and did not reach this becoming; and he comprehends the materiality that is future as “<em>impermanent in the sense of destruction” </em>since it will be produced in the next becoming, will be destroyed there too, and will not pass on to a further becoming; and he comprehends the materiality that is present as “<em>impermanent in the sense of destruction” </em>since it is destroyed here and does not pass beyond. And he comprehends the materiality that is internal as “<em>impermanent in the sense of destruction</em>” since it is destroyed as internal and does not pass on to the external state. And he comprehends the materiality that is external … gross … subtle … inferior … superior … far … And he comprehends the materiality that is near as “<em>impermanent in the sense of destruction</em>” since it is destroyed there and does not pass on to the far state. And all this is impermanent in the sense of destruction. Accordingly, there is “<em>one kind of comprehension” </em>in this way; but it is effected in eleven ways. </p>
<p><a name="XX.15" ><a href="ch-27.html#XX.15" ><b class="bfseries">§15.</b></a></a>  And all that [materiality] is “<em>painful in the sense of terror</em>.” In the sense of terror because of its terrifyingness; for what is impermanent brings terror, as it does to the deities in the Sīhopama Sutta (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>III 84</b>). So this is also painful in the sense of terror. Accordingly, there is one kind of comprehension in this way too; but it is effected in eleven ways. </p>
<p><a name="XX.16" ><a href="ch-27.html#XX.16" ><b class="bfseries">§16.</b></a></a>  And just as it is painful, so too all that [materiality] is “<em>not-self in the sense of having no core</em>.” In the sense of having no core because of the absence of any core of self conceived as a self, an abider, a doer, an experiencer, one who is his own master; for what is impermanent is painful (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>III 82</b>), and it is impossible to escape the impermanence, or the rise and fall and oppression, of self, so how could it have the state of a doer, and so on? Hence it is said, “Bhikkhus, were materiality self, it would not lead to affliction” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
	[
	<a href="ch-03.html#S" >S</a>
	]
</span>III 66</b>), and so on. So this is also not-self in the sense of having no core. Accordingly, there is one kind of comprehension in this way too, but it is effected in eleven ways. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[611]</i></span> The same method applies to feeling, and so on. </p>
<p><a name="XX.17" ><a href="ch-27.html#XX.17" ><b class="bfseries">§17.</b></a></a>  But what is impermanent is necessarily classed as formed, etc., and so in order to show the synonyms for that [impermanence], or in order to show how the attention given to it occurs in different ways, it is restated in the text thus: “Materiality, whether past, future, or present, is impermanent, formed, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, subject to fall, subject to fading away, subject to cessation” (<a href="ch-27.html#XX.7" >§7</a>). The same method applies to feeling, and so on. </p>
<h2 id="a0000000357">2.3 Strengthening of Comprehension in Forty Ways</h2>

  <sup class="footnotemark">4</sup>
</a> In the answer to it comprehension of impermanence, etc., is set forth by him analytically in the way beginning: “[Seeing] the five aggregates as impermanent, as painful, as a disease, a boil, a dart, a calamity, an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as a plague, a disaster, a terror, a menace, as fickle, perishable, unenduring, as no protection, no shelter, no refuge, as empty, vain, void, not-self, as a danger, as subject to change, as having no core, as the root of calamity, as murderous, as due to be annihilated, as subject to cankers, as formed, as Māra’s bait, as subject to birth, subject to ageing, subject to illness, subject to death, subject to sorrow, subject to lamentation, subject to despair, subject to defilement.

If we know, we shall say.” He asked a thousand questions. </p>
<p><a name="XX.112" ><a href="ch-27.html#XX.112" ><b class="bfseries">§112.</b></a></a>  The elder replied without hesitation to each question. To the remark, “Your knowledge is very keen, venerable sir; when was this state attained by you?” he replied, “Sixty years ago, friend.” “Do you practice concentration, venerable sir?”—“That is not difficult, friend.”—“Then make an elephant, venerable sir.” The elder made an elephant all white. “Now, venerable sir, make that elephant come straight at you with his ears outstretched, his tail extended, putting his trunk in his mouth and making a horrible trumpeting.” The elder did so. Seeing the frightful aspect of the rapidly approaching elephant, he sprang up and made to run away. Then the elder with cankers destroyed put out his hand, and catching him by the hem of his robe, he said, “Venerable sir, is there any timidity in one whose cankers are destroyed?” </p>

He knelt at Dhammadinna’s feet and said, “Help me, friend Dhammadinna.”—“Venerable sir, I will help you; that is why I came. Do not worry.” Then he expounded a meditation subject to him. The elder took the meditation subject and went up on to the walk, and with the third footstep he reached Arahantship. The elder was a bhikkhu of hating temperament, it seems. Such bhikkhus waver on account of illumination. </p>

For when his insight is adorned with illumination, etc., attachment arises in him, which is subtle and peaceful in aspect, and it relies on (clings to) that insight; and he is not able to discern that attachment as a defilement. <span style="color:#BF7F3F"><i class="itshape">[637]</i></span> </p>

I have surely reached the path, reached fruition.” Thus he takes what is not the path to be the path and what is not fruition to be fruition. When he takes what is not the path to be the path and what is not fruition to be fruition, the course of his insight is interrupted. He drops his basic meditation subject and sits just enjoying the attachment. </p>
<p><a name="XX.124" ><a href="ch-27.html#XX.124" ><b class="bfseries">§124.</b></a></a>  And here illumination, etc., are called imperfections because they are the basis for imperfection, not because they are [kammically] unprofitable. But attachment is both an imperfection and the basis for imperfection. </p>
<p>As basis only they amount to ten; but with the different ways of taking them they come to thirty. </p>
<p><a name="XX.125" ><a href="ch-27.html#XX.125" ><b class="bfseries">§125.</b></a></a>  How? When a man takes it thus, “illumination has arisen in me,” his way of taking is due to [false] view. When he takes it thus, “How agreeable this illumination that has arisen is,” his way of taking is due to pride (conceit). When he relishes the illumination, his way of taking is due to craving. So there are three ways of taking it in the case of illumination, that is to say, due to [false] view, to pride (conceit), and to craving. Likewise with the rest. So they come to thirty with the three ways of taking them. Owing to their influence an unskilful, unwary meditator wavers and gets distracted about illumination, etc., and he sees each one of them-illumination and the rest-as “This is mine, this is I, this is my self” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

</a> But it is impermanent, formed, conditionally arisen, subject to destruction, subject to fall, subject to fading away, subject to cessation.” Or he thinks: “If illumination were self, it would be right to take it as self; but being not-self, it is taken as self. Therefore it is not-self in the sense of no power being exercisable over it; it is impermanent in the sense of non-existence after having come to be; it is painful in the sense of oppression by rise and fall,” all of which should be treated in detail according to the method given under the immaterial septad (<a href="ch-27.html#XX.83" >§83</a>).

<p><a name="XX.128" ><a href="ch-27.html#XX.128" ><b class="bfseries">§128.</b></a></a>  So he unravels this thirtyfold skein of imperfections without falling a prey to wavering. He defines what is the path and what is not the path thus: “The states consisting in illumination, etc., are not the path; but it is insight knowledge that is free from imperfections and keeps to its course that is the path.” </p>
<p><a name="XX.129" ><a href="ch-27.html#XX.129" ><b class="bfseries">§129.</b></a></a>  The knowledge that is established in him by his coming to know the path and the not-path thus, “This is the path, this is not the path,” should he understood as the purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path. </p>
<p><a name="XX.130" ><a href="ch-27.html#XX.130" ><b class="bfseries">§130.</b></a></a>  So at this point the defining of three truths has been effected by him. How? The defining of the truth of suffering has been effected with the defining of mentality-materiality in the purification of view. The defining of the truth of origination has been effected with the discerning of conditions in the purification by overcoming doubt. The defining of the truth of the path has been effected with the emphasizing of the right path in this purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path. So the defining of three truths has been effected firstly by means of mundane knowledge only. </p>

‘<em>Contemplation of destruction</em>’ is the contemplation of the momentary dissolution of formations. ‘<em>Perception of compactness</em>’ is the assumption of unity in a continuity or mass or function or object. ‘<em>Contemplation of destruction</em>’ is contemplation of non-existence after having been, they say. Contemplation of destruction is the understanding by means of which he resolves the compact into its elements and sees that it is impermanent in the sense of destruction. Its completion starts with contemplation of dissolution, and so there is abandoning of perception of compactness then, but before that there is not, because it has not been completed. (9) The seeing of the dissolution of formations both by actual experience and by inference and the directing of attention to their cessation, in other words, their dissolution, is <em>contemplation of fall</em>; through it accumulation [of kamma] is abandoned; his consciousness does not incline with craving to the occurrence of that [aggregate-process of existence] for the purpose of which one accumulates [kamma]. (10) Seeing change in the two ways through aging and through death in what is born, or seeing another essence subsequent to the delimitation of such and such [an essence supervening] in what was discerned by means of the material septad, and so on, is ‘<em>contemplation of change</em>’; by its means he abandons the ‘<em>perception of lastingness</em>,’ the assumption of stability. (11)–(13) The three beginning with ‘<em>contemplation of the signless</em>’ are the same as the three beginning with contemplation of impermanence. (11) ‘<em>The sign</em>’ is the mere appearance of formations as if graspable entities, which is due to the individualization of particular functions and which, owing to perception of unity in continuity and in mass, is assumed to be temporarily enduring or permanent. (12) ‘<em>Desire</em>’ is longing for pleasure, or it is desire consisting in greed, and so on; it means inclinationto formations owing to craving. (13) ‘<em>Misinterpreting</em>’ is misinterpreting as self. It is owing to their opposing the ‘<em>sign</em>,’ etc., that the contemplations of impermanence, etc., are called by the names of ‘signless,’ etc.; so they should be regarded as opposed to the apprehension of a sign, etc., just as they are to the perception of permanence, and so on. (14) Insight that occurs by knowing an object consisting of a visible datum, etc., and by seeing the dissolution of the consciousness that had that visible datum, etc., as its object, and by apprehending voidness through the dissolution thus, ‘Only formations dissolve, there is nothing beyond the death of formations,’ is the higher understanding, and that is insight into states, thus it is ‘<em>insight into states that is higher understanding</em>’; by its means he abandons the view accompanied by craving that is the misinterpretation occurring as grasping at a permanent core, and so on. (15) ‘<em>Correct knowledge and vision</em>’ is a term for the seeing of mentality-materiality with its conditions; by its means he abandons the ‘<em>misinterpreting due to confusion</em>’ that begins thus, ‘Was I in the past?’ (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">

	<a href="ch-03.html#M" >M</a>

</span>I 8</b>) and that begins thus, ‘Thus the world is created by an Overlord’ (?). (16) The knowledge consisting in the seeing of danger in all kinds of becomings, etc., which has arisen owing to the appearance of terror is ‘<em>contemplation of danger</em>’; by its means he abandons the craving occurring as ‘<em>misinterpreting due to reliance</em>’ because he does not see any reliance or support. (17) The knowledge of reflection that is the means to deliverance from formations is ‘<em>contemplation of reflection</em>’; by its means he abandons the ignorance that is ‘<em>non-reflection</em>’ on impermanence, etc., and is opposed to reflection on them. (18) Equanimity about formations and conformity knowledge are ‘<em>contemplation of turning away</em>’; for owing to it the mind retreats and recoils from all formations, like a water drop on a lotus leaf, so by its means he abandons the ‘<em>misinterpretation due to bondage</em>,’ which is the occurrence of the defilements consisting of the fetters of sense desire, and so on.

In this case, however, the last two members of the dependent origination are left out. “Although states possessed of aging-and-death are mentioned under the heading of birth and of aging-and-death in comprehension by groups, etc., nevertheless here in the description of knowledge of rise and fall, if it were said ‘present birth is born; the characteristic of its generation is rise, the characteristic of its change is fall,’ etc., it would be tantamount to an affirmation and approval of the proposition that birth and aging-and-death were possessed of birth and of aging-and-death.

In this connection Vism-mhṭ quotes the following text: “Friends, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who declares the attainment of Arahantship in my presence has always arrived there by four paths or by one of them. What four? Here, friends, a bhikkhu develops insight preceded by serenity. While he is developing insight preceded by serenity the path is born in him. He cultivates, develops, repeats that path. As he does so his fetters are abandoned and his inherent tendencies are brought to an end. Again, friends, a bhikkhu develops serenity preceded by insight … He develops serenity and insight yoked equally. Again, friends, a bhikkhu’s mind is seized by agitation about highest states. When that consciousness settles down internally, becomes steady, unified and concentrated, then the path is born in him … his inherent tendencies are brought to an end” (<b class="bfseries"><span class="cite">
