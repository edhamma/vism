<blockquote>
<div><p><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id53" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>53<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  <strong>Q.</strong> Now, if a yogin who dwells in pure virtue aspires to accomplish excellent good merits and wishes to acquire the benefits of the austerities, he should consider thus: “Why should one acquire the benefits of the austerities”?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Because of the varying disposition of the yogin. For paucity of wishes, for contentment with little, for freedom from doubt, for the destruction of craving, for the increase of energy, for the sake of using little and not accepting the offerings made to others, for solitude, for the cutting down of clinging and for the protection of moral virtue. These (the merits of the austerities) are the equipment of concentration. These are (practices of) the ancient lineage of the Ariyas. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id54" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>54<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  These are the excellent considerations.</p>

To partake of food given to the Order as a whole, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id97" id="id36" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>88<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  of assured food, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id98" id="id37" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>89<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  of ticket food, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id99" id="id38" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>90<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  of food offered on lunar fortnights, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id100" id="id39" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>91<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  of food offered on a sacred day, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id101" id="id40" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>92<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  of food offered to the many <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id102" id="id41" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>93<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  and of food given in honour of a monastery, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id103" id="id42" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>94<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  for expedience’ sake is not to fail in the observance of ‘begged food’. If one sees faults, one should reject such food.</p>
<p>What is the teaching as regards expedience in the observance of ‘regular alms-round’? If a bhikkhu on seeing elephants or horses fighting or in rut, at the gate, avoids them, or on seeing an outcast <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id104" id="id43" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>95<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  covers his bowl, or goes behind his preceptor, teacher or a visiting bhikkhu, and thus commits certain faults for expedience’ sake, he does not fail in ‘regular alms-round’.</p>
<p>What is the teaching as regards expedience in the observance of ‘one eating’? If in the course of taking a meal at the proper time, one sees elephants, horses, cattle or snakes, or if it rains, or if one sees one’s preceptor <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id105" id="id44" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>96<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  or teacher, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id106" id="id45" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>97<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  or a visiting bhikkhu, and stands up for expedience’ sake, and after that resumes one’s meal, one does not fail in the observance of ‘one-eating’.</p>
<p>In ‘measured food’ and ‘no food after time’, there is nothing by way of expedience.</p>
<p>What is the teaching as regards expedience in the observance of ‘dwelling in a peaceful place’? If one goes to the village for causing people to undertake the precepts, confession of faults, hearing the Law, the service of the sacred day, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id107" id="id46" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>98<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  the service of the termination of the rainy season residence, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id108" id="id47" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>99<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  sickness, nursing the sick, inquiries regarding doubts on the discourses, and the like, it is not failing in the observance of ‘dwelling in a peaceful place’.</p>
<p>What is the teaching as regards expedience in the observance of ‘dwelling under a tree’? If a bhikkhu, because of rain, goes to a roofed place and returns when it is bright, he does not fail in the observance of ‘dwelling under a tree’.</p>
<p>Expedience in the observance of ‘dwelling in a dewy place’, ‘dwelling amongst the graves’, and ‘any chanced upon place’ is also like this. A bhikkhu may dwell elsewhere.</p>
<p>There is nothing by way of expedience regarding ‘always sitting and not lying down’. Yet there is a tradition as regards the expediency of pouring (medicine) into the nose. By this one does not fail in ‘always sitting and not lying down’. <em>[37/100]</em></p>

<h2>Miscellaneous teachings</h2>
<p>And again one fulfils eight teachings through these thirteen austerities. In the <em>Abhidhamma</em> these eight are taught: “‘Measured food’ and ‘one-eating’ are involved in ‘no food after time’. ‘Dwelling under a tree’, ‘dwelling in a dewy place’, ‘dwelling among the graves’ are involved in ‘dwelling in a peaceful place’, because, if one gathers funds for building a house, or if one likes to (do remunerative) work, keeps animals or is attached to ‘dwelling in a peaceful place’, one’s mind is not at ease. Thus thinking one dwells in peace ‘under a tree’, ‘among the graves’ or ‘in a dewy place’ ”. Thus the eight are fulfilled.</p>
<p>By these eight austerities three teachings are fulfilled: the first: ‘dwelling in a peaceful place’, the second: ‘dirt-rags’, the third: ‘begged food’. If these three are pure, the austerities are fulfilled. Therefore the Buddha taught the Venerable Elder Nanda thus: “Always you should observe ‘dwelling in a peaceful place’, ‘dirt-rags’ and ‘begged food’. You should not nurse your body and life. You should not see the objects of lust.” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id109" id="id48" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>100<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Who is called observer of the austerity-factors? <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id111" id="id49" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>101<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  How many kinds of teachings are there regarding austerities? Which of three persons observe the austerities? How many seasons are there for the observance of austerities? Who is an observer and teacher of the austerities?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> There are thirteen austerities taught by the Buddha. These are precepts of the Buddha. These are called austerity-factors. Here the skilful, unskilful and the non-characterizable <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id112" id="id50" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>102<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  should not be taught, because the unskilful man is full of lust. He does not remove lust. He lives in wickedness. He is greedy of worldly advantages. Therefore, unskill is (not) austerity.</p>
<p>How many kinds of teachings are there? There are two teachings of austerities: non-greed and non-delusion. The Buddha has said, “If a bhikkhu who observes (the austerity of) ‘dirt-rags’ is endowed with paucity of wishes, is contented with little, enjoys tranquillity, is doubt-free and relies on freedom, then he is called one who observes (the austerity of) ‘dirt-rags’ ”. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id113" id="id51" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>103<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>  The other austerities are all greedless and delusion-free. By means of this greedlessness, a bhikkhu removes ignorance in thirteen places. And again by this greed lessness which the Buddha made possible (a bhikkhu) arouses in his mind aversion, and being free from doubt, reasonably removes the stain of lust and crookedness. By this freedom from delusion, he removes weariness of the flesh and crookedness. These are the two teachings of austerities. These are greedlessness and freedom from delusion. <em>[38/101]</em></p>
<p>Which of the three persons observe the austerities’? The man of greed and the man of delusion observe the austerities. The man of hate cannot’ observe the austerities. The man of greed and the man of delusion can observe the austerities. The man of greed accomplishes heedfulness through attachment. If he becomes heedless, he overcomes greed. Delusion is non-doubting. By means of the austerities a bhikkhu can fulfil heedfulness. If he is heedful, he can overcome delusion well. That is why the man of greed and the man of delusion observe the austerities.</p>
<p>Heedless men suffer and do evil. A heedless man should not observe (because if he does, he will increase his sufferings), just as a person afflicted with a disease of phlegm worsens on taking hot drinks.</p>
<p>And again there is a tradition. A heedless man should dwell ‘in a peaceful place’ or ‘under a tree’. Why should he dwell ‘in a peaceful place’? Because there are no worldly troubles there.</p>
<p>How many seasons are there for the observance of austerities? Eight months are the period for three austerities, namely, ‘dwelling under a tree’, ‘dwelling in a dewy place’ and ‘dwelling among the graves’. The Buddha has permitted dwelling in roofed places in the rainy season. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id115" id="id52" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>104<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> ‘Who is an observer and teacher of the austerities’?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> There is one who is an observer and teacher of the austerities. There is one who is an observer but not a teacher of austerities. There is one who is not an observer but only a teacher of austerities, and there is one who is neither an observer nor a teacher of austerities.</p>
<p>Who is ‘an observer and teacher of austerities’? The Consummate One who has fulfilled the observance of the austerities.</p>
<p>Who is ‘an observer but not a teacher of austerities’? The Consummate One who has not fulfilled the observance of the austerities.</p>
<p>Who is ‘not an observer but only a teacher of austerities’? The learner or the commoner who has fulfilled the observance of the austerities.</p>
<p>Who is ‘neither an observer nor a teacher of austerities’? The learner or the commoner who has not fulfilled the observance of the austerities.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the salient characteristic, function and manifestation of the austerities?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Paucity of wishes is the salient characteristic. Contentment is the function. Non-doubting is the manifestation.</p>
<p>And again non-attachment is the salient characteristic. Moderation is the function. Non-retrogression is the manifestation.</p>
<p>What are the initial, medial and final stages of the austerities? The undertaking to observe is the initial stage. Practice is the medial stage and rejoicing is the final stage. <em>[39/102]</em></p>
