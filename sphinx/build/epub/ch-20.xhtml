<h3>1.1 The Fifth Purification</h3>
<p id="xx-2"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-2"><span class="std std-ref">§2</span></a> One who desires to accomplish this should first of all apply himself to the inductive insight called “comprehension by groups. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id39" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>” Why? Because knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path appears in connection with the appearance of illumination, etc. (<a class="reference internal" href="#xx-105"><span class="std std-ref">XX.105f.</span></a>) in one who has begun insight. For it is after illumination, etc., have appeared in one who has already begun insight that there comes to be knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path. And comprehension by groups is the beginning of insight. That is why it is set forth next to the overcoming of doubt. Besides, knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path arises when “full-understanding as investigation” is occurring, and full-understanding as investigation comes next to full-understanding as the known (see <a class="reference internal" href="ch-19.xhtml#xix-21"><span class="std std-ref">XIX.21</span></a>). So this is also a reason why one who desires to accomplish this purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path should first of all apply himself to comprehension by groups.</p>

<section id="the-three-kinds-of-full-understanding">
<h3>1.2 The Three Kinds of Full-Understanding</h3>
<p id="xx-3"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-3"><span class="std std-ref">§3</span></a> Here is the exposition: there are three kinds of mundane full-understanding, that is, full-understanding as the known, full-understanding as investigation, and full-understanding as abandoning, with reference to which it was said: “Understanding that is direct-knowledge is knowledge in the sense of being known. Understanding that is full-understanding is knowledge in the sense of <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-632"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-632"><span class="std std-ref">632</span></a>/690</span> investigating. Understanding that is abandoning is knowledge in the sense of giving up” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patis"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭis</span></a> <em>I 87</em>).</p>
<p>Herein, the understanding that occurs by observing the specific characteristics of such and such states thus, “Materiality (<em>rūpa</em>) has the characteristic of being molested (<em>ruppana</em>); feeling has the characteristic of being felt,” is called <em>full-understanding as the known.</em> The understanding consisting in insight with the general characteristics as its object that occurs in attributing a general characteristic to those same states in the way beginning, “Materiality is impermanent, <span class="target" id="page-pts-607"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-607"><span class="std std-ref">607</span></a></span>  feeling is impermanent” is called <em>full-understanding as investigation.</em> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id40" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> The understanding consisting in insight with the characteristics as its object that occurs as the abandoning of the perception of permanence, etc., in those same states is called <em>full-understanding as abandoning</em>.</p>
<p id="xx-4"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-4"><span class="std std-ref">§4</span></a> Herein, the plane of <em>full-understanding as the known</em> extends from the delimitation of formations (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-18.xhtml#xviii"><span class="std std-ref">Ch. XVIII</span></a>) up to the discernment of conditions (Ch. XIX); for in this interval the penetration of the specific characteristics of states predominates. The plane of <em>full-understanding as investigation</em> extends from comprehension by groups up to contemplation of rise and fall (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-21.xhtml#xxi-3"><span class="std std-ref">XXI.3f.</span></a>); for in this interval the penetration of the general characteristics predominates. The plane of <em>full-understanding as abandoning</em> extends from contemplation of dissolution onwards (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-21.xhtml#xxi-10"><span class="std std-ref">XXI.10</span></a>); for from there onwards the seven contemplations that effect the abandoning of the perception of permanence, etc., predominate thus:</p>
<p>(1) Contemplating [formations] as impermanent, a man abandons the perception of permanence.</p>
<p>(2) Contemplating [them] as painful, he abandons the perception of pleasure.</p>
<p>(3) Contemplating [them] as not-self, he abandons the perception of self.</p>
<p>(4) Becoming dispassionate, he abandons delighting.</p>
<p>(5) Causing fading away, he abandons greed.</p>
<p>(6) Causing cessation, he abandons originating.</p>
<p>(7) Relinquishing, he abandons grasping (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patis"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭis</span></a> <em>I 58</em>). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id41" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="xx-5"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-5"><span class="std std-ref">§5</span></a> <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-633"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-633"><span class="std std-ref">633</span></a>/691</span> So, of these three kinds of full-understanding, only full-understanding as the known has been attained by this meditator as yet, which is because the delimitation of formations and the discernment of conditions have already been accomplished; the other two still remain to be attained. Hence it was said above: “Besides, knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path arises when full-understanding as investigation is occurring, and full-understanding as investigation comes next to full-understanding as the known. So this is also a reason why one who desires to accomplish this purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path should first of all apply himself to comprehension by groups” (<a class="reference internal" href="#xx-2"><span class="std std-ref">§2</span></a>).</p>

<p>“How is it that understanding of defining past, future and present states by summarization is knowledge of comprehension?</p>

<p>“Understanding of defining by summarization thus, ‘Materiality, whether past, future, or present, is impermanent, formed, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, subject to fall, subject to fading away, subject to cessation,’ is knowledge of comprehension.

Understanding of defining by generalization thus, ‘With becoming as condition there is birth … With ignorance as condition there are formations; without ignorance as condition there are no formations,’ is knowledge of comprehension. Understanding of defining by generalization thus, ‘In the past and in the future with ignorance as condition there are formations; without ignorance as condition there are no formations’ is knowledge of comprehension.</p>
<p>“Knowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding that.

<p id="xx-10"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-10"><span class="std std-ref">§10</span></a> For this is said in the Paṭisambhidā in the description of what is to be directly known: “Bhikkhus, all is to be directly known.

But what is thus abbreviated includes the supramundane states. These should not be dealt with at this stage because they are not amenable to comprehension.

<section id="comprehension-by-groupsapplication-of-text">
<h3>2.2 Comprehension by Groups—Application of Text</h3>
<p id="xx-13"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-13"><span class="std std-ref">§13</span></a> Here is the application of the directions dealing with the aggregates: “Any materiality whatever, (i–iii) whether past, future, or present, (iv–v) internal or <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-636"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-636"><span class="std std-ref">636</span></a>/694</span> external, (vi–vii) gross or subtle, (viii–ix) inferior or superior, (x-xi) far or near—he defines all materiality as impermanent: this is one kind of comprehension. He defines it as painful: <span class="target" id="page-pts-610"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-610"><span class="std std-ref">610</span></a></span>  this is one kind of comprehension. He defines it as not-self: this is one kind of comprehension” (see <a class="reference internal" href="#xx-6"><span class="std std-ref">§6</span></a>). At this point this bhikkhu [takes] all materiality, which is described without specifying as “<em>any materiality whatever</em>,” and having delimited it in the eleven instances, namely, with the past triad and with the four dyads beginning with the internal dyad, he “<em>defines all materiality as impermanent</em>,” he comprehends that it is impermanent. How? In the way stated next. For this is said: “<em>Materiality, whether past, future or present, is impermanent in the sense of destruction</em>.”</p>
<p id="xx-14"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-14"><span class="std std-ref">§14</span></a> Accordingly, he comprehends the materiality that is past as “<em>impermanent in the sense of destruction”</em> because it was destroyed in the past and did not reach this becoming; and he comprehends the materiality that is future as “<em>impermanent in the sense of destruction”</em> since it will be produced in the next becoming, will be destroyed there too, and will not pass on to a further becoming; and he comprehends the materiality that is present as “<em>impermanent in the sense of destruction”</em> since it is destroyed here and does not pass beyond. And he comprehends the materiality that is internal as “<em>impermanent in the sense of destruction</em>” since it is destroyed as internal and does not pass on to the external state. And he comprehends the materiality that is external … gross … subtle … inferior … superior … far … And he comprehends the materiality that is near as “<em>impermanent in the sense of destruction</em>” since it is destroyed there and does not pass on to the far state. And all this is impermanent in the sense of destruction. Accordingly, there is “<em>one kind of comprehension”</em> in this way; but it is effected in eleven ways.</p>
<p id="xx-15"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-15"><span class="std std-ref">§15</span></a> And all that [materiality] is “<em>painful in the sense of terror</em>.” In the sense of terror because of its terrifyingness; for what is impermanent brings terror, as it does to the deities in the Sīhopama Sutta (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>III 84</em>). So this is also painful in the sense of terror. Accordingly, there is one kind of comprehension in this way too; but it is effected in eleven ways.</p>
<p id="xx-16"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-16"><span class="std std-ref">§16</span></a> And just as it is painful, so too all that [materiality] is “<em>not-self in the sense of having no core</em>.” In the sense of having no core because of the absence of any core of self conceived as a self, an abider, a doer, an experiencer, one who is his own master; for what is impermanent is painful (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>III 82</em>), and it is impossible to escape the impermanence, or the rise and fall and oppression, of self, so how could it have the state of a doer, and so on? Hence it is said, “Bhikkhus, were materiality self, it would not lead to affliction” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>III 66</em>), and so on. So this is also not-self in the sense of having no core. Accordingly, there is one kind of comprehension in this way too, but it is effected in eleven ways. <span class="target" id="page-pts-611"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-611"><span class="std std-ref">611</span></a></span>  The same method applies to feeling, and so on.</p>
<p id="xx-17"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-17"><span class="std std-ref">§17</span></a> But what is impermanent is necessarily classed as formed, etc., and so in order to show the synonyms for that [impermanence], or in order to show how the attention given to it occurs in different ways, it is restated in the text thus: “Materiality, whether past, future, or present, is impermanent, formed, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, subject to fall, subject to fading away, subject to cessation” (<a class="reference internal" href="#xx-7"><span class="std std-ref">§7</span></a>). The same method applies to feeling, and so on.</p>

<h3>2.3 Strengthening of Comprehension in Forty Ways</h3>
<p id="xx-18"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-18"><span class="std std-ref">§18</span></a> <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-637"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-637"><span class="std std-ref">637</span></a>/695</span> Now, when the Blessed One was expounding conformity knowledge, he [asked the question]: “By means of what forty aspects does he acquire liking that is in conformity? By means of what forty aspects does he enter into the certainty of rightness?” (P‘8). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id42" id="id4" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>4<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> In the answer to it comprehension of impermanence, etc., is set forth by him analytically in the way beginning: “[Seeing] the five aggregates as impermanent, as painful, as a disease, a boil, a dart, a calamity, an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as a plague, a disaster, a terror, a menace, as fickle, perishable, unenduring, as no protection, no shelter, no refuge, as empty, vain, void, not-self, as a danger, as subject to change, as having no core, as the root of calamity, as murderous, as due to be annihilated, as subject to cankers, as formed, as Māra’s bait, as subject to birth, subject to ageing, subject to illness, subject to death, subject to sorrow, subject to lamentation, subject to despair, subject to defilement. Seeing the five aggregates as impermanent, he acquires liking that is in conformity. And seeing that the cessation of the five aggregates is the permanent Nibbāna, he enters into the certainty of rightness” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patis"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭis</span></a> <em>II 238</em>). So in order to strengthen that same comprehension of impermanence, pain, and not-self in the five aggregates, this [meditator] also comprehends these five aggregates by means of that [kind of comprehension].</p>
<p id="xx-19"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-19"><span class="std std-ref">§19</span></a> How does he do it? He does it by means of comprehension as impermanent, etc., stated specifically as follows: He comprehends each aggregate as <em>impermanent</em> because of non-endlessness, and because of possession of a beginning and an end; as <em>painful</em> because of oppression by rise and fall, and because of being the basis for pain; as <em>a disease</em> because of having to be maintained by conditions, and because of being the root of disease; as <em>a boil</em> because of being consequent upon impalement by suffering, because of oozing with the filth of defilements, and because of being swollen by arising, ripened by ageing, and burst by dissolution; as <em>a dart</em> because of producing oppression, because of penetrating inside, and because of being hard to extract; as <em>a calamity</em> because of having to be condemned, because of bringing loss, and <span class="target" id="page-pts-612"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-612"><span class="std std-ref">612</span></a></span>  because of being the basis for calamity; as <em>an affliction</em> because of restricting freedom, and because of being the foundation for affliction; as <em>alien</em> because of inability to have mastery exercised over them, and because of intractability; as <em>disintegrating</em> because of crumbling through sickness, ageing and death; as <em>a plague</em> because of bringing various kinds of ruin; as <em>a disaster</em> because of bringing unforeseen and plentiful adversity, and because of being the basis for all kinds of terror, and because of being the opposite of the supreme comfort called the stilling of all suffering; as a <em>menace</em> because of being bound up with many kinds of adversity, because of being menaced <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id43" id="id5" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>5<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> by ills, and because of unfitness, as a menace, to be entertained;

<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id44" id="id6" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>6<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> as <em>perishable</em> because of having the nature of perishing both by violence and naturally;

And that is through the eighty-one mundane arisings of consciousness, that is to say, it is by kamma accumulated in a previous becoming that this immaterial [mentality] is generated. And in the first place it is generated as [one of] the nineteen kinds of arisings of consciousness as rebirth-linking (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-17.xhtml#xvii-130"><span class="std std-ref">XVII.130</span></a>). But the modes in which it is generated should be understood according to the method given in the Description of the Dependent Origination (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-17.xhtml#xvii-134"><span class="std std-ref">XVII.134f.</span></a>). That same [nineteenfold arising of consciousness is generated] as life-continuum as well, starting from the consciousness next to rebirth-linking consciousness, and as death consciousness at the termination of the life span. And when it is of the sense sphere, and the object in the six doors is a vivid one, it is also generated as registration.</p>
<p id="xx-44"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-44"><span class="std std-ref">§44</span></a> In the course of an existence, eye-consciousness, together with its associated states, supported by light and caused by attention is generated because the eye is intact and because visible data have come into focus. For it is actually when a visible datum has reached presence that it impinges on the eye at the instant of the eye-sensitivity’s presence. When it has done so, the life-continuum arises and ceases twice. Next to arise is the functional mind element with that same object, accomplishing the function of adverting. Next to that, eye-consciousness, which is the result of profitable or of unprofitable [kamma] and sees that same visible datum. <span class="target" id="page-pts-618"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-618"><span class="std std-ref">618</span></a></span>  Next, the resultant mind element, which receives that same visible datum. Next, the resultant root-causeless mind-consciousness element, which investigates that same visible datum. Next, the functional mind-consciousness element without root-cause and accompanied by equanimity, which determines that same visible datum. Next, [it is generated either] as one from among the profitable ((l)–(8)), unprofitable ((22)–(33)), or functional ((71) and (73)–(80)) kinds of consciousness belonging to the sense sphere, either as consciousness accompanied by equanimity and without root-cause (71), <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id57" id="id19" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>19<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> or as five or seven impulsions. Next, in the case of sense-sphere beings, [it is generated] as any of the eleven kinds of registration consciousness conforming [as to object] with the impulsions. The same applies to the remaining doors. But in the case of the mind door-exalted consciousnesses also arise.</p>

So the meditator allots one hundred years for this “taking up” and “putting down” and he attributes the three characteristics to formations. How? All formations between these limits are impermanent. Why? Because of the occurrence of rise and fall, because of change, because of temporariness, and because of preclusion of permanence. But since arisen formations have arrived at presence, and when present are afflicted by ageing, and on arriving at ageing are bound to dissolve, they are therefore painful because of continual oppression, because of being hard to bear, because of being the basis of suffering, and because of precluding pleasure. And since no one has any power over arisen formations in the three instances, “Let them not reach presence”, “Let those that have reached presence not age,” and “Let those that have reached ageing not dissolve,” and they are void of the possibility of any power being exercised over them, they are therefore not-self because void, because ownerless, because unsusceptible to the wielding of power, and because of precluding a self. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id58" id="id20" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>20<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> <span class="target" id="page-pts-619"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-619"><span class="std std-ref">619</span></a></span></p>

<p id="xx-66"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-66"><span class="std std-ref">§66</span></a> When he sees formations stage by stage with insight thus, his comprehension of materiality has become subtle. Here is a simile for its subtlety. A border dweller, it seems, who was familiar with torches of wood and grass, etc., but had never seen a lamp before, came to a city. Seeing a lamp burning in the market, he asked a man, “I say, what is that lovely thing called?”—“What is lovely about that? It is called a lamp. Where it goes to when its oil and wick are used up no one knows.” Another told him, “That is crudely put; for the flame in each third portion of the wick as it gradually burns up ceases there without reaching the other parts.” Other told him, “That is crudely put too; for the flame in each inch, in each half-inch, in each thread, in each strand, will cease without reaching the other strands; but the flame cannot appear without a strand.”</p>

That originated when hunger is satisfied is plump, fresh, tender, smooth and soft to touch.

Likewise in the case of the doors of the ear, nose, and tongue. In the case of the body door there are forty-four with the decads of body and sex and the instances originated by temperature, and so on. In the case of the mind door there are fifty-four, too, with the decads of the heart-basis, the body, and sex, and those instances originated by the temperature, and so on. Discerning all that materiality, he attributes the three characteristics to it thus: The materiality occurring in the eye door ceases there without reaching the ear door; the materiality occurring in the ear door … the nose door; the materiality occurring in the nose door … the tongue door; the materiality occurring in the tongue door … the body door; the materiality occurring in the body door ceases there without reaching the mind door: therefore it is impermanent, painful, not-self.</p>

After it has become the colour of dark green leaves, as it follows out the successive stages of such material continuity, it eventually becomes withered foliage, and at the end of the year it breaks loose from its stem and falls off.</p>

After he has comprehended as “impermanent, painful, not-self” the materiality of the “disappearance of what grows old in each stage” and that “arising from nutriment,” “arising from temperature,” “kamma-born,” “consciousness-originated” and “natural,” he comprehends that consciousness too as “impermanent, painful, not-self” by means of a subsequent consciousness. In this way he is said to comprehend by pairs.</p>

But both the material meditation subject and the immaterial meditation subject become familiar when the comprehending is taken as far as the tenth consciousness. That is why it is said <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id64" id="id26" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>26<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> that it can be stopped at the tenth.

<p id="xx-82"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-82"><span class="std std-ref">§82</span></a> <em>5. By removal of [false] view,</em> 6*. by abolition of conceit,* 7. <em>by ending of attachment</em>: there is no individual method for any of these three. But when he has discerned this materiality as described above and this immateriality as described here, then he sees that there is no living being over and above the material and the immaterial. As soon as he no longer sees a being, the perception of a being is removed. When he discerns formations with consciousness from which perception of a being has been removed, then [false] view does not arise in him. When [false] view does not arise in him, then [false] view is said to be removed.</p>
<p>When he discerns formations with consciousness from which [false] view has been removed, then conceit does not arise in him. When conceit does not <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-654"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-654"><span class="std std-ref">654</span></a>/712</span> arise, conceit is said to be abolished. When he discerns formations with consciousness from which conceit has been abolished, then craving does not arise in him. When craving does not arise in him, attachment is said to be ended. This firstly is what is said in the Discourse on Purification.</p>
<p id="xx-83"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-83"><span class="std std-ref">§83</span></a> But in the Discourse on the Noble Ones’ Heritages, after setting forth the headings thus: “As removal of [false] view, as abolition of conceit, as ending of attachment,” the following method is set forth: “There is no removal of [false] view in one who takes it thus, ‘I see with insight, my insight’; <span class="target" id="page-pts-628"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-628"><span class="std std-ref">628</span></a></span>  there is removal of [false] view in one who takes it thus, ‘Only formations see formations with insight, comprehend, define, discern, and delimit them.’ There is no abolition of conceit in one who takes it thus, ‘I see thoroughly with insight, I see well with insight’; there is abolition of conceit in one who takes it thus, ‘Only formations see formations with insight, comprehend, define, discern, and delimit them.’ There is no ending of attachment in one who is pleased with insight thus, ‘I am able to see with insight’; there is ending of attachment in one who takes it thus, ‘Only formations see formations with insight, comprehend, define, discern, and delimit them.’</p>
<p id="xx-84"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-84"><span class="std std-ref">§84</span></a> “There is removal of [false] view in one who sees thus: ‘If formations were self, it would be right to take them as self; but being not-self they are taken as self. Therefore they are not-self in the sense of no power being exercisable over them; they are impermanent in the sense of non-existence after having come to be; they are painful in the sense of oppression by rise and fall.’</p>
<p id="xx-85"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-85"><span class="std std-ref">§85</span></a> “There is abolition of conceit in one who sees thus: ‘If formations were permanent, it would be right to take them as permanent; but being impermanent they are taken as permanent. Therefore they are impermanent in the sense of non-existence after having come to be; they are painful in the sense of oppression by rise and fall; they are not-self in the sense of no power being exercisable over them.’</p>
<p id="xx-86"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-86"><span class="std std-ref">§86</span></a> “There is ending of attachment in one who sees thus: ‘If formations were pleasant, it would be right to take them as pleasant; but being painful they are taken as pleasant. Therefore they are painful in the sense of oppression by rise and fall; they are impermanent in the sense of non-existence after having come to be; they are not-self in the sense of no power being exercisable over them.’</p>
<p id="xx-87"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-87"><span class="std std-ref">§87</span></a> “Thus there comes to be the removal of [false] view in one who sees formations as not-self; there comes to be the abolishing of conceit in one who sees them as impermanent; there comes to be the ending of attachment in one who sees them as painful. So this insight is valid in each instance.”</p>
<p id="xx-88"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-88"><span class="std std-ref">§88</span></a> This is how he comprehends formations by attributing the three characteristics to them by means of the immaterial septad.</p>
<p>At this stage both the material meditation subject and the immaterial meditation subject have become familiar to him.</p>

<p id="xx-90"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-90"><span class="std std-ref">§90</span></a> <em>Eighteen principal insights</em> is a term for understanding that consists in the kinds of insight beginning with contemplation of impermanence. Now, as regards these: (1) One who develops the contemplation of impermanence abandons the perception of permanence, (2) one who develops the contemplation of pain <span class="target" id="page-pts-629"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-629"><span class="std std-ref">629</span></a></span>  abandons the perception of pleasure, (3) one who develops the contemplation of not-self abandons the perception of self, (4) one who develops the contemplation of dispassion abandons delighting, (5) one who develops the contemplation of fading away abandons greed, (6) one who develops the contemplation of cessation abandons origination, (7) one who develops the contemplation of relinquishment abandons grasping, (8) one who develops the contemplation of destruction abandons the perception of compactness, (9) one who develops the contemplation of fall [of formations] abandons accumulation [of kamma], (10) one who develops the contemplation of change abandons the perception of lastingness, (11) one who develops the contemplation of the signless abandons the sign, (12) one who develops the contemplation of the desireless abandons desire, (13) one who develops the contemplation of voidness abandons misinterpreting (insistence), (14) one who develops the insight into states that is higher understanding abandons misinterpreting (insistence) due to grasping at a core, (15) one who develops correct knowledge and vision abandons misinterpreting (insistence) due to confusion, (16) one who develops the contemplation of danger abandons misinterpreting (insistence) due to reliance, (17) one who develops the contemplation of reflection abandons non-reflection, (18) one who develops the contemplation of turning away abandons misinterpreting (insistence) due to bondage (see <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patis"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭis</span></a> <em>I 32f.</em>). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id66" id="id28" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>28<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

And then (1) the contemplation of impermanence and (11) the contemplation of the signless are one in meaning and different only in the letter, and so are (2) the contemplation of pain and (12) the contemplation of the desireless, and so are (3) the contemplation of not-self and (13) the contemplation of voidness (see <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patis"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭis</span></a> <em>II 63</em>). Consequently these have been penetrated by him as well. But (14) insight into states that is higher understanding is all kinds of insight, and (15) correct knowledge and vision is included in purification by overcoming doubt (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-19.xhtml#xix"><span class="std std-ref">Ch.

<h3>2.10 Knowledge of Rise and Fall—I</h3>
<p id="xx-93"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-93"><span class="std std-ref">§93</span></a> Having purified his knowledge in this way by abandoning the perceptions of permanence, etc., which oppose the contemplations of impermanence, etc., he passes on from comprehension knowledge and begins the task of attaining that of contemplation of rise and fall, which is expressed thus: “Understanding <span class="target" id="page-pts-630"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-630"><span class="std std-ref">630</span></a></span>  of contemplating present states’ change is knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patis"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭis</span></a> <em>I 1</em>), and which comes next after comprehension knowledge.</p>
<p id="xx-94"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-94"><span class="std std-ref">§94</span></a> When he does so, he does it first in brief. Here is the text: “How is it that understanding of contemplating present states’ change is knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall? Present materiality is born [materiality]; the characteristic of its generation is rise, the characteristic of its change is fall, the contemplation is knowledge. Present feeling … perception … formations … consciousness … eye … (etc.) … Present becoming is born [becoming]; the characteristic of its generation is rise, the characteristic of its change is fall, the contemplation is knowledge” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patis"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭis</span></a> <em>I 54</em>). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id68" id="id30" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>30<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="xx-95"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-95"><span class="std std-ref">§95</span></a> In accordance with the method of this text he sees the characteristic of generation, the birth, the arising, the aspect of renewal, of born materiality, as “rise,” and he sees its characteristic of change, its destruction, its dissolution, as “fall.”</p>
<p id="xx-96"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-96"><span class="std std-ref">§96</span></a> <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-658"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-658"><span class="std std-ref">658</span></a>/716</span> He understands thus: “There is no heap or store of unarisen mentality-materiality [existing] prior to its arising. When it arises, it does not come from any heap or store; and when it ceases, it does not go in any direction. There is nowhere any depository in the way of a heap or store or hoard of what has ceased. But just as there is no store, prior to its arising, of the sound that arises when a lute is played, nor does it come from any store when it arises, nor does it go in any direction when it ceases, nor does it persist as a store when it has ceased (cf. <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>IV 197</em>), but on the contrary, not having been, it is brought into being owing to the lute, the lute’s neck, and the man’s appropriate effort, and having been, it vanishes—so too all material and immaterial states, not having been, are brought into being, and having been, they vanish.”</p>
<p id="xx-97"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-97"><span class="std std-ref">§97</span></a> Having given attention to rise and fall in brief thus, he again [does so in detail according to condition and instant by seeing those characteristics] as given in the exposition of that same knowledge of rise and fall thus: “(1) He sees the rise of the materiality aggregate in the sense of conditioned arising thus: With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of materiality; (2) … with the arising of craving … (3) … with the arising of kamma … (4) he sees the rise of the materiality aggregate in the sense of conditioned arising thus: With the arising of nutriment there is the arising of materiality; (5) one who sees the characteristic of generation sees the rise of the materiality aggregate. One who sees the rise of the materiality aggregate sees these five characteristics.</p>
<p>“(1) He sees the fall of the materiality aggregate in the sense of conditioned cessation thus: With the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of materiality; (2) … with the cessation of craving … (3) … with the cessation of kamma … (4) he sees the fall of the materiality aggregate in the sense of conditioned cessation thus: With the cessation of nutriment there is the cessation of materiality; <span class="target" id="page-pts-631"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-631"><span class="std std-ref">631</span></a></span>  (5) one who sees the characteristic of change sees the fall of the materiality aggregate. One who sees the fall of the materiality aggregate sees these five characteristics” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patis"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭis</span></a> <em>I 55f.</em>).</p>
<p>Likewise: “(1) He sees the rise of the feeling aggregate in the sense of conditioned arising thus: With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of feeling; (2) … with the arising of craving … (3) … with the arising of kamma … (4) he sees the rise of the feeling aggregate in the sense of conditioned arising thus: With the arising of contact there is the arising of feeling; (5) one who sees the characteristic of generation sees the rise of the feeling aggregate. One who sees the rise of the feeling aggregate sees those five characteristics.</p>
<p>“(1) He sees the fall of the feeling aggregate in the sense of conditioned cessation thus: With the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of feeling; (2) … with the cessation of craving … (3) … with the cessation of kamma … (4) he sees the fall of the feeling aggregate in the sense of conditioned cessation thus: With the cessation of contact there is the cessation of feeling; (5) one who sees the characteristic of change sees the fall of the feeling aggregate. One who sees the fall of the feeling aggregate sees these five characteristics” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patis"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭis</span></a> <em>I 55f.</em>).</p>
<p>And as in the case of the feeling aggregate, [that is, substituting “contact” for the “nutriment” in the case of materiality,] so for the perception and formations <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-659"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-659"><span class="std std-ref">659</span></a>/717</span> aggregates. So also for the consciousness aggregate with this difference, that for the phrases containing “contact” there are substituted “with the arising of mentality-materiality” and “with the cessation of mentality-materiality.”</p>
<p>So there are fifty characteristics stated with the ten in the case of each aggregate by seeing rise and fall, by means of which he gives attention in detail <em>according to condition</em> and <em>according to instant</em> (<em>moment</em>) in this way: “The rise of materiality is thus; its fall is thus; so it rises, so it falls.”</p>
<p id="xx-98"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-98"><span class="std std-ref">§98</span></a> As he does so his knowledge becomes clearer thus: “So, it seems, these states, not having been, are brought into being; having been, they vanish.”</p>
<p>When he thus sees rise and fall in the two ways, according to condition and according to instant, the several truths, aspects of the dependent origination, methods, and characteristics become evident to him.</p>
<p id="xx-99"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-99"><span class="std std-ref">§99</span></a> When he sees the arising of aggregates with the arising of ignorance and the cessation of aggregates with the cessation of ignorance, this is his seeing of rise and fall <em>according to condition.</em> When he sees the rise and fall of aggregates by seeing the characteristic of generation and the characteristic of change, this is his seeing of rise and fall <em>according to instant.</em> For it is only at the instant of arising that there is the characteristic of generation, and only at the instant of dissolution that there is the characteristic of change.</p>
<p id="xx-100"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-100"><span class="std std-ref">§100</span></a> So when he sees rise and fall in the two ways, according to condition and according to instant thus, the <em>truth</em> of origination becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery of the progenitor. <span class="target" id="page-pts-632"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-632"><span class="std std-ref">632</span></a></span>  The truth of suffering becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to instant owing to his discovery of the suffering due to birth. The truth of cessation becomes evident to him through seeing fall according to condition owing to his discovery of the non-arising of things produced by conditions when their conditions do not arise. The truth of suffering becomes evident to him too through seeing fall according to instant owing to his discovery of the suffering due to death. And his seeing of rise and fall becomes evident to him as the truth of the path thus: “This is the mundane path” owing to abolition of confusion about it.</p>
<p id="xx-101"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-101"><span class="std std-ref">§101</span></a> The <em>dependent origination</em> in forward order becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery that “When this exists, that comes to be” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>I 262</em>). The dependent origination in reverse order becomes evident to him through seeing fall according to condition owing to his discovery that “When this does not exist, that does not come to be” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>I 264</em>). Dependently-arisen states become evident to him through seeing rise and fall according to instant owing to his discovery of the characteristic of the formed; for the things possessed of rise and fall are formed and conditionally arisen.</p>
<p id="xx-102"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-102"><span class="std std-ref">§102</span></a> The <em>method</em> of identity becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery of unbroken continuity in the connection of cause with fruit. Then he more thoroughly abandons the annihilation view. The method of diversity becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to instant owing to his discovery that each [state] is new [as it arises]. Then he more thoroughly abandons the eternity view. The method of uninterestedness becomes evident to <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-660"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-660"><span class="std std-ref">660</span></a>/718</span> him through seeing rise and fall according to condition owing to his discovery of the inability of states to have mastery exercised over them. Then he more thoroughly abandons the self view. The method of ineluctable regularity becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery of the arising of the fruit when the suitable conditions are there. Then he more thoroughly abandons the moral-inefficacy-of-action view.</p>
<p id="xx-103"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-103"><span class="std std-ref">§103</span></a> The <em>characteristic</em> of not-self becomes evident to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery that states have no curiosity and that their existence depends upon conditions. The characteristic of impermanence becomes evident to him through seeing rise and fall according to instant owing to his discovery of non-existence after having been and owing to his discovery that they are secluded from past and future. The characteristic of pain becomes evident to him [through that] too owing to his discovery of oppression by rise and fall. And the characteristic of individual essence becomes evident to him [through that] too owing to his discovery of delimitation [of states] by rise and fall. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id69" id="id31" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>31<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> And in the characteristic of individual essence the temporariness of the characteristic of what is formed becomes evident to him [through that] too owing to his discovery of the non-existence of fall at the instant of rise and the non-existence of rise at the instant of fall. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id70" id="id32" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>32<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="xx-104"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-104"><span class="std std-ref">§104</span></a> When the several truths, aspects of the dependent origination, methods, and characteristics have become evident to him thus, then formations appear to him as perpetually renewed: “So these states, it seems, being previously unarisen, critic, and being arisen, they cease.” <span class="target" id="page-pts-633"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-633"><span class="std std-ref">633</span></a></span>  And they are not only perpetually renewed, but they are also short-lived like dew-drops at sunrise (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-A"><span class="xref std std-term">A</span></a> <em>IV 137</em>), like a bubble on water (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>III 14</em> I), like a line drawn on water (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-A"><span class="xref std std-term">A</span></a> <em>IV 137</em>), like a mustard seed on an awl’s point (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Nidd"><span class="xref std std-term">Nidd</span></a> <em>I 42</em>), like a lightning flash (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Nidd"><span class="xref std std-term">Nidd</span></a> <em>I 43</em>). And they appear without core, like a conjuring trick (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>III 141</em>), like a mirage (Dhp 46), like a dream (Sn 807), like the circle of a whirling firebrand (source untraced), like a goblin city (source untraced), like froth (Dhp 46), like a plantain trunk (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>III 142</em>), and so on.</p>
<p>At this point he has attained tender insight-knowledge called contemplation of rise and fall, which has become established by penetrating the fifty characteristics in this manner: “Only what is subject to fall arises; and to be arisen necessitates fall.” With the attainment of this he is known as a “beginner of insight.”</p>

<p id="xx-105"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-105"><span class="std std-ref">§105</span></a> Now, when he is a beginner of insight with this tender insight, ten imperfections of insight arise in him.

They are: (1) illumination, (2) knowledge, (3) rapturous happiness, (4) tranquillity, (5) bliss (pleasure), (6) resolution, (7) exertion, (8) assurance, (9) equanimity, and (10) attachment.</p>
<p id="xx-106"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-106"><span class="std std-ref">§106</span></a> For this is said: “How does the mind come to be seized by agitation about higher states? When a man is bringing [formations] to mind as impermanent, illumination arises in him. He adverts to the illumination thus, ‘Illumination is a [Noble One’s] state.’ <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id71" id="id33" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>33<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> The distraction due to that is agitation. When his mind is seized by that agitation, he does not understand correctly [their] appearance as impermanent, he does not understand correctly [their] appearance as painful, he does not understand correctly [their] appearance as not-self.</p>
<p id="xx-107"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-107"><span class="std std-ref">§107</span></a> “Likewise, when he is bringing [formations] to mind as impermanent, knowledge arises in him … happiness … tranquillity … bliss … resolution … exertion … establishment … equanimity … attachment arises in him. He adverts to the attachment thus, ‘Attachment is a [Noble One’s] state.’ The distraction due to that is agitation. When his mind is seized by that agitation, he does not correctly understand [their] appearance as impermanent, <span class="target" id="page-pts-634"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-634"><span class="std std-ref">634</span></a></span>  he does not correctly understand [their] appearance as painful, he does not correctly understand [their] appearance as not-self” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patis"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭis</span></a> <em>II 100</em>). <em>1.</em> Herein, illumination is illumination due to insight. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id72" id="id34" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>34<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> When it arises, the meditator thinks, “Such illumination never arose in me before. I have surely reached the path, reached fruition;” thus he takes what is not the path to be the path and what is not fruition to be fruition. When he takes what is not the path to be the path <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-662"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-662"><span class="std std-ref">662</span></a>/720</span> and what is not fruition to be fruition, the course of his insight is interrupted. He drops his own basic meditation subject and sits just enjoying the illumination.</p>
<p id="xx-108"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-108"><span class="std std-ref">§108</span></a> But this illumination arises in one bhikkhu illuminating only as much as the seat he is sitting on; in another, the interior of his room; in another, the exterior of his room; in another the whole monastery … a quarter league … a half league … a league … two leagues … three leagues; in another bhikkhu it arises making a single light from the earth’s surface up to the Brahmā-world. But in the Blessed One it arose illuminating the ten-thousandfold world-element.</p>
<p id="xx-109"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-109"><span class="std std-ref">§109</span></a> This story illustrates how it varies. Two elders, it seems, were sitting inside a room with a double wall at Cittalapabbata. It was the Uposatha of the dark of the moon that day. All directions were covered by a blanket of cloud, and at night the four-factored gloom <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id73" id="id35" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>35<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> prevailed. Then one elder said, “Venerable sir, the flowers of the five colours on the lion table on the shrine terrace are visible to me now.” The other said, “What you say is nothing wonderful, friend. Actually the fishes and turtles in the ocean a league away are visible to me now.”</p>
<p id="xx-110"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-110"><span class="std std-ref">§110</span></a> This imperfection of insight usually arises in one who has acquired serenity and insight. Because the defilements suppressed by the attainments do not manifest themselves, he thinks, “I am an Arahant,” like the Elder Mahā-Nāga who lived at Uccavālika, like the Elder Mahā-Datta who lived at Haṅkana, like the Elder Cūḷa-Sumana who lived in the Nikapenna meditation house at Cittalapabbata.</p>
<p id="xx-111"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-111"><span class="std std-ref">§111</span></a> Here is one story as an illustration. The Elder Dhammadinna, it seems, who lived at Talaṅgara—one of the great ones with cankers destroyed who possessed the categories of discrimination—was the instructor of a large community of bhikkhus. One day, as he was sitting in his own daytime quarters, he wondered, “Has our teacher, the Elder Mahā-Nāga who lives at Uccavālika, <span class="target" id="page-pts-635"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-635"><span class="std std-ref">635</span></a></span>  brought his work of asceticism to its conclusion, or not?” He saw that he was still an ordinary man, and he knew that if he did not go to him, he would die an ordinary man. He rose up into the air with supernormal power and alighted near the elder, who was sitting in his daytime quarters. He paid homage to him, doing his duty, and sat down at one side. To the question, “Why have you come unexpectedly, friend Dhammadinna?” he replied, “I have come to ask a question, venerable sir.” He was told, “Ask, friend. If we know, we shall say.” He asked a thousand questions.</p>
<p id="xx-112"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-112"><span class="std std-ref">§112</span></a> The elder replied without hesitation to each question. To the remark, “Your knowledge is very keen, venerable sir; when was this state attained by you?” he replied, “Sixty years ago, friend.” “Do you practice concentration, venerable sir?”—“That is not difficult, friend.”—“Then make an elephant, venerable sir.” The elder made an elephant all white. “Now, venerable sir, make that elephant come straight at you with his ears outstretched, his tail extended, putting his trunk in his mouth and making a horrible trumpeting.” The elder did so. Seeing the frightful aspect of the rapidly approaching elephant, he sprang up and made to run away. Then the elder with cankers destroyed put out his hand, and catching him by the hem of his robe, he said, “Venerable sir, is there any timidity in one whose cankers are destroyed?”</p>
<p id="xx-113"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-113"><span class="std std-ref">§113</span></a> <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-663"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-663"><span class="std std-ref">663</span></a>/721</span> Then he recognized that he was still an ordinary man. He knelt at Dhammadinna’s feet and said, “Help me, friend Dhammadinna.”—“Venerable sir, I will help you; that is why I came. Do not worry.” Then he expounded a meditation subject to him. The elder took the meditation subject and went up on to the walk, and with the third footstep he reached Arahantship. The elder was a bhikkhu of hating temperament, it seems. Such bhikkhus waver on account of illumination.</p>
<p id="xx-114"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-114"><span class="std std-ref">§114</span></a> <em>2. Knowledge</em> is knowledge due to insight. As he is estimating and judging material and immaterial states perhaps knowledge that is unerring, keen, incisive, and very sharp arises in him, like a lightning flash.</p>
<p id="xx-115"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-115"><span class="std std-ref">§115</span></a> <em>3. Rapturous happiness</em> is happiness due to insight. Perhaps at that time the five kinds of happiness, namely, minor happiness, momentary happiness, showering happiness, uplifting happiness, and pervading (rapturous) happiness arise in him filling his whole body.</p>
<p id="xx-116"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-116"><span class="std std-ref">§116</span></a> <em>4. Tranquillity</em> is tranquillity due to insight. As he is sitting at that time in his night or day quarters perhaps <span class="target" id="page-pts-636"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-636"><span class="std std-ref">636</span></a></span>  there is no fatigue or heaviness or rigidity or unwieldiness or sickness or crookedness in his body and his mind, but rather his body and mind are tranquillized, light, malleable, wieldy, quite sharp, and straight. With his body and mind aided by this tranquillity, etc., he experiences at that time the superhuman delight with reference to which it is said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A bhikkhu when his mind is quiet</div>
<div class="line">Retires to an empty place,</div>
<div class="line">And his right insight in the Dhamma</div>
<div class="line">Gives him superhuman delight.</div>
<div class="line">It is because he comprehends</div>
<div class="line">The rise and fall of aggregates</div>
<div class="line">That he finds happiness and joy</div>
<div class="line">And knows it to be deathless (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhp"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhp</span></a> <em>373f.</em>).</div>
</div>
<p>This is how tranquillity, associated with lightness, etc., arises in him, bringing about this superhuman delight.</p>
<p id="xx-117"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-117"><span class="std std-ref">§117</span></a> <em>5. Bliss</em> (<em>pleasure</em>) is bliss due to insight. At that time perhaps there arises in him exceedingly refined bliss (pleasure) flooding his whole body.</p>
<p id="xx-118"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-118"><span class="std std-ref">§118</span></a> <em>6. Resolution</em> is faith. For strong faith arises in him in association with insight in the form of extreme confidence of consciousness and its concomitants.</p>
<p id="xx-119"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-119"><span class="std std-ref">§119</span></a> <em>7. Exertion</em> is energy. For well-exerted energy, neither too lax nor too strained, arises in him in association with insight.</p>
<p id="xx-120"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-120"><span class="std std-ref">§120</span></a> <em>8. Assurance</em> (lit. establishment) is mindfulness. For well-established (well-assured), well-founded mindfulness, which is dug in and as immovable as the king of mountains, arises in him in association with insight. Whatever subject he adverts to, consciously reacts to, gives attention to, reviews, appears to him (he is assured of) owing to mindfulness, which descends into it, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id74" id="id36" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>36<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> enters into it, just as the other world does to one who has the divine eye.</p>
<p id="xx-121"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-121"><span class="std std-ref">§121</span></a> <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-664"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-664"><span class="std std-ref">664</span></a>/722</span> <em>9. Equanimity</em> is both equanimity about insight and equanimity in adverting. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id75" id="id37" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>37<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> For equanimity about insight, which is neutrality about formations, arises strongly in him at that time. It is also equanimity in adverting in the mind door. For whatever the subject he adverts to, his adverting works as incisively and sharply as a lightning flash, like a red-hot spear plunged into a basket of leaves.</p>
<p id="xx-122"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-122"><span class="std std-ref">§122</span></a> 10. <em>Attachment</em> is attachment due to insight. For when his insight is adorned with illumination, etc., attachment arises in him, which is subtle and peaceful in aspect, and it relies on (clings to) that insight; and he is not able to discern that attachment as a defilement. <span class="target" id="page-pts-637"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-637"><span class="std std-ref">637</span></a></span></p>
<p id="xx-123"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-123"><span class="std std-ref">§123</span></a> And as in the case of illumination, so too in the case of the other imperfections that may arise, the meditator thinks thus: “Such knowledge … such rapturous happiness … tranquillity … bliss … resolution … exertion … assurance … equanimity … attachment never arose in me before. I have surely reached the path, reached fruition.” Thus he takes what is not the path to be the path and what is not fruition to be fruition. When he takes what is not the path to be the path and what is not fruition to be fruition, the course of his insight is interrupted. He drops his basic meditation subject and sits just enjoying the attachment.</p>
<p id="xx-124"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-124"><span class="std std-ref">§124</span></a> And here illumination, etc., are called imperfections because they are the basis for imperfection, not because they are [kammically] unprofitable. But attachment is both an imperfection and the basis for imperfection.</p>
<p>As basis only they amount to ten; but with the different ways of taking them they come to thirty.</p>
<p id="xx-125"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-125"><span class="std std-ref">§125</span></a> How? When a man takes it thus, “illumination has arisen in me,” his way of taking is due to [false] view. When he takes it thus, “How agreeable this illumination that has arisen is,” his way of taking is due to pride (conceit). When he relishes the illumination, his way of taking is due to craving. So there are three ways of taking it in the case of illumination, that is to say, due to [false] view, to pride (conceit), and to craving. Likewise with the rest. So they come to thirty with the three ways of taking them. Owing to their influence an unskilful, unwary meditator wavers and gets distracted about illumination, etc., and he sees each one of them-illumination and the rest-as “This is mine, this is I, this is my self” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>I 135</em>). Hence the Ancients said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">He wavers about illumination,</div>
<div class="line">And knowledge, rapturous happiness,</div>
<div class="line">About the tranquilness, the bliss,</div>
<div class="line">Whereby his mind becomes confused;</div>
<div class="line">He wavers about resolution,</div>
<div class="line">Exertion, and assurance, too,</div>
<div class="line">The adverting-equanimity,</div>
<div class="line">And equanimity and attachment (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patis"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭis</span></a> <em>II 102</em>).</div>
</div>
<p id="xx-126"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-126"><span class="std std-ref">§126</span></a> <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-665"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-665"><span class="std std-ref">665</span></a>/723</span> But when illumination, etc., arise, a skilful, wary meditator who is endowed with discretion either defines and examines it with understanding thus: “This illumination has arisen. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id76" id="id38" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>38<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> But it is impermanent, formed, conditionally arisen, subject to destruction, subject to fall, subject to fading away, subject to cessation.” Or he thinks: “If illumination were self, it would be right to take it as self; but being not-self, it is taken as self. Therefore it is not-self in the sense of no power being exercisable over it; it is impermanent in the sense of non-existence after having come to be; it is painful in the sense of oppression by rise and fall,” all of which should be treated in detail according to the method given under the immaterial septad (<a class="reference internal" href="#xx-83"><span class="std std-ref">§83</span></a>). And as in the case of illumination, so too with the rest.</p>
<p id="xx-127"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-127"><span class="std std-ref">§127</span></a> Having investigated it thus, he sees the illumination as “This is not mine, this is not I, this is not my self.” <span class="target" id="page-pts-638"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-638"><span class="std std-ref">638</span></a></span>  He sees knowledge … (etc.) … attachment as “This is not mine, this is not I, this is not my self.” Seeing thus, he does not waver or vacillate about the illumination, and so on. Hence the Ancients said:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">So when a man of understanding has</div>
<div class="line">Examined these ten things and is now skilled</div>
<div class="line">In agitation about higher states</div>
<div class="line">He no more falls a prey to wavering (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patis"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭis</span></a> <em>II 102</em>).</div>
</div>
<p id="xx-128"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-128"><span class="std std-ref">§128</span></a> So he unravels this thirtyfold skein of imperfections without falling a prey to wavering. He defines what is the path and what is not the path thus: “The states consisting in illumination, etc., are not the path; but it is insight knowledge that is free from imperfections and keeps to its course that is the path.”</p>
<p id="xx-129"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-129"><span class="std std-ref">§129</span></a> The knowledge that is established in him by his coming to know the path and the not-path thus, “This is the path, this is not the path,” should he understood as the purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path.</p>
<p id="xx-130"><a class="reference internal" href="#xx-130"><span class="std std-ref">§130</span></a> So at this point the defining of three truths has been effected by him. How? The defining of the truth of suffering has been effected with the defining of mentality-materiality in the purification of view. The defining of the truth of origination has been effected with the discerning of conditions in the purification by overcoming doubt. The defining of the truth of the path has been effected with the emphasizing of the right path in this purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path. So the defining of three truths has been effected firstly by means of mundane knowledge only.</p>

<p>“Comprehension by placing together in groups (totals) the states that are differentiated into past, future and present is ‘<em>comprehension by groups</em>.’ This, it seems, is the term used by the inhabitants of Jambudīpa (India). However, insight into states by means of the method beginning, ‘Any materiality whatever’ (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>III 16</em>) is ‘<em>inductive insight</em>.’ This, it seems, is the term used by the inhabitants of Tambapaṇṇidīpa (Sri Lanka).

<p><em>Tīraṇa</em> could also be rendered by “judging.” On specific and general characteristics Vism-mhṭ says: “Hardness, touching, etc., as the respective characteristics of earth, contact, etc., which are observable at all three instants [of arising, presence and dissolution], are apprehended by their being established as the respective individual essences of definite materialness. But it is not so with the characteristics of impermanence, and so on. These are apprehended as though they were attributive material instances because they have to be apprehended under the respective headings of dissolution and rise and fall, of oppression, and of insusceptibility to the exercise of mastery” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>779</em>).

<p>“‘<em>Contemplating as impermanent</em>’ is contemplating, comprehending, formations in the aspect of impermanence. ‘<em>The perception of permanence</em>’ is the wrong perception that they are permanent, eternal; the kinds of consciousness associated with wrong view should be regarded as included under the heading of ‘perception.’ So too with what follows. ‘<em>Becoming dispassionate</em>’ is seeing formations with dispassion by means of the contemplation of dispassion induced by the contemplations of impermanence, and so on. ‘<em>Delighting</em>’ is craving accompanied by happiness. ‘Causing fading away’ is contemplating in such a way that greed (<em>rāga</em>) for formations does not arise owing to the causing of greed to fade (<em>virajjana</em>) by the contemplation of fading away (<em>virāgānupassanā</em>); for one who acts thus is said to abandon greed. ‘<em>Causing cessation</em>’ is contemplating in such a way that, by the contemplation of cessation, formations cease only, they do not arise in the future through a new becoming; since one who acts thus is said to abandon the arousing (originating) of formations because of producing the nature of non-arising. ‘<em>Relinquishing</em>’ is relinquishing in such a way that, by the contemplation of relinquishment, formations are not grasped anymore; hence he said, ‘<em>He abandons grasping</em>’; or the meaning is that he relinquishes apprehending [them] as permanent, and so on” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>780</em>).</p>

<p>‘<em>Contemplation of destruction</em>’ is the contemplation of the momentary dissolution of formations. ‘<em>Perception of compactness</em>’ is the assumption of unity in a continuity or mass or function or object. ‘<em>Contemplation of destruction</em>’ is contemplation of non-existence after having been, they say. Contemplation of destruction is the understanding by means of which he resolves the compact into its elements and sees that it is impermanent in the sense of destruction. Its completion starts with contemplation of dissolution, and so there is abandoning of perception of compactness then, but before that there is not, because it has not been completed. (9) The seeing of the dissolution of formations both by actual experience and by inference and the directing of attention to their cessation, in other words, their dissolution, is <em>contemplation of fall</em>; through it accumulation [of kamma] is abandoned; his consciousness does not incline with craving to the occurrence of that [aggregate-process of existence] for the purpose of which one accumulates [kamma]. (10) Seeing change in the two ways through aging and through death in what is born, or seeing another essence subsequent to the delimitation of such and such [an essence supervening] in what was discerned by means of the material septad, and so on, is ‘<em>contemplation of change</em>’; by its means he abandons the ‘<em>perception of lastingness</em>,’ the assumption of stability. (11)–(13) The three beginning with ‘<em>contemplation of the signless</em>’ are the same as the three beginning with contemplation of impermanence. (11) ‘<em>The sign</em>’ is the mere appearance of formations as if graspable entities, which is due to the individualization of particular functions and which, owing to perception of unity in continuity and in mass, is assumed to be temporarily enduring or permanent. (12) ‘<em>Desire</em>’ is longing for pleasure, or it is desire consisting in greed, and so on; it means inclinationto formations owing to craving. (13) ‘<em>Misinterpreting</em>’ is misinterpreting as self. It is owing to their opposing the ‘<em>sign</em>,’ etc., that the contemplations of impermanence, etc., are called by the names of ‘signless,’ etc.; so they should be regarded as opposed to the apprehension of a sign, etc., just as they are to the perception of permanence, and so on. (14) Insight that occurs by knowing an object consisting of a visible datum, etc., and by seeing the dissolution of the consciousness that had that visible datum, etc., as its object, and by apprehending voidness through the dissolution thus, ‘Only formations dissolve, there is nothing beyond the death of formations,’ is the higher understanding, and that is insight into states, thus it is ‘<em>insight into states that is higher understanding</em>’; by its means he abandons the view accompanied by craving that is the misinterpretation occurring as grasping at a permanent core, and so on. (15) ‘<em>Correct knowledge and vision</em>’ is a term for the seeing of mentality-materiality with its conditions; by its means he abandons the ‘<em>misinterpreting due to confusion</em>’ that begins thus, ‘Was I in the past?’ (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>I 8</em>) and that begins thus, ‘Thus the world is created by an Overlord’ (?). (16) The knowledge consisting in the seeing of danger in all kinds of becomings, etc., which has arisen owing to the appearance of terror is ‘<em>contemplation of danger</em>’; by its means he abandons the craving occurring as ‘<em>misinterpreting due to reliance</em>’ because he does not see any reliance or support. (17) The knowledge of reflection that is the means to deliverance from formations is ‘<em>contemplation of reflection</em>’; by its means he abandons the ignorance that is ‘<em>non-reflection</em>’ on impermanence, etc., and is opposed to reflection on them. (18) Equanimity about formations and conformity knowledge are ‘<em>contemplation of turning away</em>’; for owing to it the mind retreats and recoils from all formations, like a water drop on a lotus leaf, so by its means he abandons the ‘<em>misinterpretation due to bondage</em>,’ which is the occurrence of the defilements consisting of the fetters of sense desire, and so on.

<p>“The interpreting of rise and fall must be done on a state that is present according to continuity or present according to instant but not on one that is past or future, which is why ‘of present states’ is said” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>808</em>). “Present materiality is called born materiality; it is included in the trio of instants [of arising, presence and dissolution], is what is meant. But that is hard to discern at the start, so the interpreting by insight should be done by means of presence according to continuity” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>808</em>). For the elision represented by “… (etc.) …” see <a class="reference internal" href="#xx-9"><span class="std std-ref">XX.9</span></a>. In this case, however, the last two members of the dependent origination are left out. “Although states possessed of aging-and-death are mentioned under the heading of birth and of aging-and-death in comprehension by groups, etc., nevertheless here in the description of knowledge of rise and fall, if it were said ‘present birth is born; the characteristic of its generation is rise, the characteristic of its change is fall,’ etc., it would be tantamount to an affirmation and approval of the proposition that birth and aging-and-death were possessed of birth and of aging-and-death. So the text ends with ‘becoming’ in order to avoid that” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>808</em>).</p>

What four? Here, friends, a bhikkhu develops insight preceded by serenity. While he is developing insight preceded by serenity the path is born in him. He cultivates, develops, repeats that path. As he does so his fetters are abandoned and his inherent tendencies are brought to an end. Again, friends, a bhikkhu develops serenity preceded by insight … He develops serenity and insight yoked equally. Again, friends, a bhikkhu’s mind is seized by agitation about highest states.
