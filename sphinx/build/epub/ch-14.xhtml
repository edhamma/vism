<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">When a wise man, established well in virtue,</div>
<div class="line">Develops consciousness and understanding (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-01.xhtml#i-1"><span class="std std-ref">I.1</span></a>).</div>
</div>
<p>And that has been developed in all its aspects by the bhikkhu who is thus possessed of the more advanced development of concentration that has acquired with direct-knowledge the benefits [described in Chs. XII and XIII]. But <em>understanding</em> comes next and that has still to be developed. Now, that is not easy, firstly even to know about, let alone to develop, when it is taught very briefly. In order, therefore, to deal with the detailed method of its development there is the following set of questions:</p>
<ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li><p>What is understanding?</p></li>
<li><p>In what sense is it understanding?</p></li>
<li><p>What are its characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause?</p></li>
<li><p>How many kinds of understanding are there?</p></li>
<li><p>How is it developed?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the benefits of developing understanding?</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="xiv-2"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-2"><span class="std std-ref">§2</span></a> Here are the answers:</p>
<section id="i-what-is-understanding">
<h3>1.1 (i) What is understanding?</h3>
<p>Understanding (<em>paññā</em>) is of many sorts and has various aspects. An answer that attempted to explain it all would accomplish neither its intention nor its purpose, and would, besides, lead to distraction; so we shall confine ourselves to the kind intended here, which is understanding consisting in insight knowledge associated with profitable consciousness.</p>

<section id="ii-in-what-sense-is-it-understanding">
<h3>1.2 (ii) In what sense is it understanding?</h3>
<p id="xiv-3"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-3"><span class="std std-ref">§3</span></a> (ii) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">In</span> <span class="pre">what</span> <span class="pre">sense</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">it</span> <span class="pre">understanding?</span></code> It is understanding (<em>paññā</em>) in the sense of act of understanding (<em>pajānana</em>). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id85" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> What is this act of understanding? It is <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-432"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-432"><span class="std std-ref">432</span></a>/490</span> knowing (<em>jānana</em>) in a particular mode separate from the modes of perceiving (<em>sañjānana</em>) and cognizing (<em>vijānana</em>). <span class="target" id="page-pts-437"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-437"><span class="std std-ref">437</span></a></span>  For though the state of knowing (<em>jānana-bhāva</em>) is equally present in perception (<em>saññā</em>), in consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>), and in understanding (<em>paññā</em>), nevertheless perception is only the mere perceiving of an object as, say, blue or yellow; it cannot bring about the penetration of its characteristics as impermanent, painful, and not-self. Consciousness knows the objects as blue or yellow, and it brings about the penetration of its characteristics, but it cannot bring about, by endeavouring, the manifestation of the [supramundane] path. Understanding knows the object in the way already stated, it brings about the penetration of the characteristics, and it brings about, by endeavouring, the manifestation of the path.</p>
<p id="xiv-4"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-4"><span class="std std-ref">§4</span></a> Suppose there were three people, a child without discretion, a villager, and a money-changer, who saw a heap of coins lying on a money-changer’s counter. The child without discretion knows merely that the coins are figured and ornamented, long, square or round; he does not know that they are reckoned as valuable for human use and enjoyment. And the villager knows that they are figured and ornamented, etc., and that they are reckoned as valuable for human use and enjoyment; but he does not know such distinctions as, “This one is genuine, this is false, this is half-value.” The money-changer knows all those kinds, and he does so by looking at the coin, and by listening to the sound of it when struck, and by smelling its smell, tasting its taste, and weighing it in his hand, and he knows that it was made in a certain village or town or city or on a certain mountain or by a certain master. And this may be understood as an illustration.</p>
<p id="xiv-5"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-5"><span class="std std-ref">§5</span></a> Perception is like the child without discretion seeing the coin, because it apprehends the mere mode of appearance of the object as blue and so on. Consciousness is like the villager seeing the coin, because it apprehends the mode of the object as blue, etc., and because it extends further, reaching the penetration of its characteristics. Understanding is like the money-changer seeing the coin, because, after apprehending the mode of the object as blue, etc., and extending to the penetration of the characteristics, it extends still further, reaching the manifestation of the path.</p>
<p id="xiv-6"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-6"><span class="std std-ref">§6</span></a> That is why this act of understanding should be understood as “knowing in a particular mode separate from the modes of perceiving and cognizing.” For that is what the words “it is understanding in the sense of act of understanding” refer to. However, it is not always to be found where perception and consciousness are. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id86" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> <span class="target" id="page-pts-438"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-438"><span class="std std-ref">438</span></a></span>  But when it is, it is not disconnected from those states. And because it cannot be taken as disconnected thus: “This is perception, this is consciousness, this is understanding,” its difference is consequently subtle and hard to see. Hence the venerable Nāgasena said: “A difficult thing, O King, has been done by the Blessed One.”—“What, venerable Nāgasena, is the difficult thing that has been done by the Blessed One?”—“The difficult thing, O King, done by the Blessed One was the <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-433"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-433"><span class="std std-ref">433</span></a>/491</span> defining of the immaterial states of consciousness and its concomitants, which occur with a single object, and which he declared thus: ‘This is contact, this is feeling, this is perception, this is volition, this is consciousness’” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Mil"><span class="xref std std-term">Mil</span></a> <em>87</em>).</p>

Because of the words, “One who is concentrated knows and sees correctly” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-A"><span class="xref std std-term">A</span></a> <em>V 3</em>), its proximate cause is concentration.</p>

</ol>
<p id="xiv-9"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-9"><span class="std std-ref">§9</span></a> <em>1.</em> Herein, the singlefold section is obvious in meaning.</p>
<p><em>2.</em> As regards the twofold section, the <em>mundane</em> is that associated with the mundane path and the <em>supramundane</em> is that associated with the supramundane path. So it is of two kinds as mundane and supramundane.</p>
<p id="xiv-10"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-10"><span class="std std-ref">§10</span></a> <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-434"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-434"><span class="std std-ref">434</span></a>/492</span> <em>3.</em> In the second dyad, that <em>subject to cankers</em> is that which is the object of cankers. That <em>free from cankers</em> is not their object. This dyad is the same in meaning as the mundane and supramundane. The same method applies to the dyads subject to cankers and free from cankers, associated with cankers and dissociated from cankers (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>3</em>), and so on. So it is of two kinds as subject to cankers and free from cankers, and so on.</p>
<p id="xiv-11"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-11"><span class="std std-ref">§11</span></a> <em>4.</em> In the third dyad, when a man wants to begin insight, his understanding of the defining of the four immaterial aggregates is understanding as <em>defining of mentality</em>, <span class="target" id="page-pts-439"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-439"><span class="std std-ref">439</span></a></span>  and his understanding of the defining of the material aggregate is understanding as <em>defining of materiality</em>. So it is of two kinds as the defining of mentality and of materiality.</p>
<p id="xiv-12"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-12"><span class="std std-ref">§12</span></a> <em>5.</em> In the fourth dyad, understanding belonging to two of the kinds of sense-sphere profitable consciousness, and belonging to sixteen <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id89" id="id5" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>5<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> of the kinds of path consciousness with four of the jhānas in the fivefold method, is <em>accompanied by joy</em>. Understanding belonging to two of the kinds of sense-sphere profitable consciousness, and belonging to (the remaining) four kinds of path consciousness with the fifth jhānas is <em>accompanied by equanimity</em>. So it is of two kinds as accompanied by joy or by equanimity.</p>
<p id="xiv-13"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-13"><span class="std std-ref">§13</span></a> <em>6.</em> In the fifth dyad, understanding belonging to the first path is the <em>plane of seeing</em>. Understanding belonging to the remaining three paths is the <em>plane of development</em> (see <a class="reference internal" href="ch-22.xhtml#xxii-127"><span class="std std-ref">XXII.127</span></a>). So it is of two kinds as the planes of seeing and of development.</p>
<p id="xiv-14"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-14"><span class="std std-ref">§14</span></a> <em>7.</em> As regards the triads, understanding acquired without hearing from another is that <em>consisting in what is reasoned</em> because it is produced by one’s own reasoning. Understanding acquired by hearing from another is that <em>consisting in what is heard</em>, because it is produced by hearing. Understanding that has reached absorption, having been somehow produced by (meditative) development, is that consisting in development. And this is said: Herein, what is understanding consisting in what is reasoned? In the spheres of work invented by ingenuity, or in the spheres of craft invented by ingenuity, or in the sorts of science invented by ingenuity, any preference, view, choice, opinion, judgment, liking for pondering over things, that concerns ownership of deeds (<em>kamma</em>) or is in conformity with truth or is of such kind as to conform with (the axioms) ‘Materiality is impermanent’ or ‘Feeling … perception … formations … <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-435"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-435"><span class="std std-ref">435</span></a>/493</span> consciousness is impermanent’ that one acquires without hearing it from another—that is called understanding consisting in what is reasoned.</p>
<p>(In the spheres ) that one acquires by hearing it from another—that is called understanding consisting in what is learnt (heard).</p>
<p>And all understanding in anyone who has attained (an attainment) is understanding consisting in development (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vibh"><span class="xref std std-term">Vibh</span></a> <em>324–325</em>).</p>
<p>So it is of three kinds as consisting in what is thought out, in what is heard, and in development.</p>
<p id="xiv-15"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-15"><span class="std std-ref">§15</span></a> <em>8.</em> In the second triad, the understanding that occurs contingent upon sense-sphere states has a <em>limited</em> object. That which occurs contingent upon fine-material-sphere states or immaterial-sphere states has an <em>exalted</em> object. That is mundane insight. That which occurs contingent upon Nibbāna has a <em>measureless</em> object. That is supramundane insight. So it is of three kinds as having a limited, an exalted, or a measureless object.</p>
<p id="xiv-16"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-16"><span class="std std-ref">§16</span></a> <em>9.</em> In the third triad, it is increase that is called improvement. That is twofold as the elimination of harm and the arousing of good. Skill in improvement is skill in these, according as it is said: Herein, what is skill in improvement? When a man brings these things to mind both unarisen unprofitable things do not arise and arisen unprofitable things are abandoned in him; or when he brings these things to mind <span class="target" id="page-pts-440"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-440"><span class="std std-ref">440</span></a></span>  both unarisen profitable things arise and arisen profitable things advance to growth, increase, development, and perfection in him. Whatever here is understanding, act of understanding [for words elided see <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>16</em>] non-delusion, investigation of states, right view, is called skill in improvement (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vibh"><span class="xref std std-term">Vibh</span></a> <em>325–326</em>).</p>
<p id="xiv-17"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-17"><span class="std std-ref">§17</span></a> Non-increase is what is called <em>detriment</em>. That also is twofold as the diminution of good and the arousing of harm. Skill in detriment is skill in these, according as it is said: “Herein, what is skill in detriment? When a man brings these things to mind, both unarisen profitable things do not arise …” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vibh"><span class="xref std std-term">Vibh</span></a> <em>326</em>), and so on.</p>
<p id="xiv-18"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-18"><span class="std std-ref">§18</span></a> But in either of these cases any skill in means to cause the production of such and such things, which skill occurs at that moment and is aroused on that occasion, is what is called <em>skill in means</em>, according as it is said: “And all understanding of means thereto is <em>skill in means</em>” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vibh"><span class="xref std std-term">Vibh</span></a> <em>326</em>).</p>
<p>So it is of three kinds as skill in improvement, in detriment, and in means.</p>
<p id="xiv-19"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-19"><span class="std std-ref">§19</span></a> <em>10.</em> In the fourth triad, insight-understanding initiated by apprehending one’s own aggregates is <em>interpreting the internal</em>. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id90" id="id6" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>6<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> That initiated by apprehending another’s aggregates or external materiality not bound up with the faculties, [that is, inanimate matter], is <em>interpreting the external</em>. That initiated by apprehending both is <em>interpreting the internal and external</em>. So it is of three kinds as interpreting the internal, and so on.</p>
<p id="xiv-20"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-20"><span class="std std-ref">§20</span></a> <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-436"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-436"><span class="std std-ref">436</span></a>/494</span> <em>11.</em> As regards the tetrads, in the first tetrad, knowledge that occurs contingent upon the truth of suffering is <em>knowledge of suffering</em>; knowledge that occurs contingent upon the origin of suffering is <em>knowledge of the origin of suffering</em>; knowledge that occurs contingent upon the cessation of suffering is <em>knowledge of the cessation of suffering</em>; and knowledge that occurs contingent upon the way leading to the cessation of suffering is <em>knowledge of the way leading to the cessation of suffering</em>. So it is of four kinds as knowledge of the four truths.</p>
<p id="xiv-21"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-21"><span class="std std-ref">§21</span></a> <em>12.</em> In the second tetrad, the four kinds of knowledge classed as that concerned with meaning, etc., are called the <em>four discriminations</em>. For this is said: “Knowledge about meaning is the discrimination of meaning (<em>attha-paṭisambhidā</em>). Knowledge about law is the discrimination of law (<em>dhamma-paṭisambhidā</em>). Knowledge about enunciation of language dealing with meaning and law is the discrimination of language (<em>nirutti-paṭisambhidā</em>). Knowledge about kinds of knowledge is discrimination of perspicuity (<em>paṭibhāna-paṭisambhidā</em>)” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vibh"><span class="xref std std-term">Vibh</span></a> <em>293</em>).</p>
<p id="xiv-22"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-22"><span class="std std-ref">§22</span></a> Herein, <em>meaning</em> (<em>attha</em>) is briefly a term for the fruit of a cause (<em>hetu</em>). For in accordance with the cause it is served <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id91" id="id7" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>7<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>arrived at, reached, therefore it is called “meaning” (or “purpose”). But in particular the five things, namely, (i) anything conditionally produced, <span class="target" id="page-pts-441"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-441"><span class="std std-ref">441</span></a></span>  (ii) Nibbāna, (iii) the meaning of what is spoken, (iv) (kamma-) result, and (v) functional (consciousness), should be understood as <em>meaning</em>. When anyone reviews that meaning, any knowledge of his, falling within the category (<em>pabheda</em>) concerned with meaning, is the <em>discrimination of meaning</em>.</p>
<p id="xiv-23"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-23"><span class="std std-ref">§23</span></a> <em>Law</em> (<em>dhamma</em>) is briefly a term for a condition (<em>paccaya</em>). For since a condition necessitates (<em>dahati</em>) whatever it may be, makes it occur or allows it to happen, it is therefore called “law” (<em>dhamma</em>). But in particular the five things, namely, (i) any cause that produces fruit, (ii) the noble path, (iii) what is spoken, (iv) what is profitable, and (v) what is unprofitable, should be understood as <em>law</em>. When anyone reviews that law, any knowledge of his, falling within the category concerned with law, is the <em>discrimination of law</em>.</p>
<p id="xiv-24"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-24"><span class="std std-ref">§24</span></a> <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-437"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-437"><span class="std std-ref">437</span></a>/495</span> This same meaning is shown in the Abhidhamma by the following analysis:</p>
<p>(a) “Knowledge about suffering is the <em>discrimination of meaning</em>. Knowledge about the origin of suffering is the <em>discrimination of law</em>. [Knowledge about the cessation of suffering is the <em>discrimination of meaning</em>. Knowledge about the way leading to the cessation of suffering is the <em>discrimination of law</em>] …</p>
<p>(b) “Knowledge about cause is the <em>discrimination of law</em>. Knowledge about the fruit of a cause is the <em>discrimination of meaning</em> …</p>
<p>(c) “Knowledge about whatever things are born, become, brought to birth, produced, completed, made manifest, is the <em>discrimination of meaning</em>. Knowledge about the things from which those things were born, became, were brought to birth, produced, completed, made manifest, is the <em>discrimination of law</em> …</p>
<p>(d) “Knowledge about ageing and death is the <em>discrimination of meaning</em>. Knowledge about the origin of ageing and death is the <em>discrimination of law</em>. [Knowledge about the cessation of ageing and death is the <em>discrimination of meaning</em>. Knowledge about the way leading to the cessation of ageing and death is the <em>discrimination of law</em>. Knowledge about birth … becoming … clinging … craving … feeling … contact … the sixfold base … mentality-materiality … consciousness … knowledge about formations is the <em>discrimination of meaning</em>. Knowledge about the origin of formations is the <em>discrimination of law</em>.] Knowledge about the cessation of formations is the <em>discrimination of meaning</em>. Knowledge about the way leading to the cessation of formations is the <em>discrimination of law</em> …</p>
<p>(e) “Here a bhikkhu knows the Dhamma (Law)—the Discourses, Songs, [Expositions, Stanzas, Exclamations, Sayings, Birth Stories, Marvels, and] Answers to Questions—this is called the <em>discrimination of law</em>. He knows the meaning of whatever is said thus: ‘This is the meaning of this that was said; this is the meaning of this that was said’—this is called the <em>discrimination of meaning</em> …</p>
<p>(f) “What states are profitable? On an occasion when profitable consciousness of the sense sphere has arisen [that is accompanied by joy and associated with knowledge, having a visible datum as its object … or a mental datum as its object, or contingent upon whatever it may be, on that occasion there is contact … (for elision see <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>§1</em>) … there is non-wavering]—these things are profitable. Knowledge about these things is the discrimination of law. Knowledge about their result is the discrimination of meaning” … (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vibh"><span class="xref std std-term">Vibh</span></a> <em>293–295</em>). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id92" id="id8" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>8<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

And it occurs itself only through its connection with the states that occur, like a pilot; it does not cause occurrence after dissolution, because of its own absence and that of what has to be made to occur. It does not prolong presence at the moment of dissolution because it is itself dissolving, like the flame of a lamp when the wick and the oil are getting used up. But it must not be regarded as destitute of power to maintain, make occur, and make present, because it does accomplish each of these functions at the moment stated (cf. <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>§635</em>). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id109" id="id25" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>25<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

Its proximate cause is the matter delimited. And it is on account of it that one can say of material things delimited that “this is above, below, around, that.”</p>
<p id="xiv-64"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-64"><span class="std std-ref">§64</span></a> <em>17. Lightness of matter</em> has the characteristic of non-slowness. Its function is to dispel heaviness of matter. It is manifested as light transformability.

<p><em>18. Malleability of matter</em> has the characteristic of non-stiffenedness. Its function is to dispel stiffness of matter. It is manifested as non-opposition to any kind of action.

<p><em>19. Wieldiness of matter</em> has the characteristic of wieldiness that is favourable to bodily action. Its function is to dispel unwieldiness. It is manifested as non-weakness.

<p id="xiv-65"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-65"><span class="std std-ref">§65</span></a> These three, however, are not found apart from each other.

<p id="xiv-66"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-66"><span class="std std-ref">§66</span></a> <em>20. Growth of matter</em> has the characteristic of setting up. Its function is to make material instances emerge in the first instance. It is manifested as launching; or it is manifested as the completed state. Its proximate cause is grown matter.</p>
<p><em>21. Continuity of matter</em> has the characteristic of occurrence. Its function is to anchor. It is manifested as non-interruption. Its proximate cause is matter that is to be anchored.</p>
<p>Both of these are terms for matter at its birth; but owing to difference of mode, and according to [different persons’] susceptibility to instruction, the teaching in the summary (<em>uddesa</em>) in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī is given as “growth and continuity” (cf. <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>§596</em>); but since there is here no difference in meaning, consequently in the description (<em>niddesa</em>) of these words, “the setting up of the sense-bases is the growth of matter” and “the growth of matter is the continuity of matter” is said (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>§642</em>, 732, 865).</p>
<p id="xiv-67"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-67"><span class="std std-ref">§67</span></a> And in the Commentary, after saying, “It is genesis that is called ‘setting up,’ increase that is called ‘growth,’ occurrence that is called ‘continuity,’” this simile is given: “Genesis as setting up is like the time when water comes up in a hole dug in a river bank; increase as growth is like the time when it fills [the hole]; occurrence as continuity is like the time when it overflows.” And at the end of the simile it is said: “So what is stated? Setting up is stated by sense-base; sense-base is stated by setting up.” Consequently, it is the first genesis of material instances that is their <em>setting up</em>; the genesis also of others that are generated in addition to those is <em>growth</em> since it appears in the aspect of increase; the repeated genesis also of others that are generated in addition to those is <em>continuity</em> since it appears in the aspect of anchoring. This is how it should be understood to have been declared thus.</p>
<p id="xiv-68"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-68"><span class="std std-ref">§68</span></a> <em>22. Ageing</em> has the characteristic of maturing (ripening) material instances. Its function is to lead on towards [their termination]. It is manifested as the loss of newness without the loss of individual essence, like oldness in paddy. Its proximate cause is matter that is maturing (ripening). This is said with reference to the kind of ageing that is evident through seeing alteration in teeth, etc., as their brokenness, and so on (cf. <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>§644</em>). But that of immaterial states, which has no such [visible] alteration, is called hidden ageing. And that in earth, water, rocks, the moon, the sun, etc., is called incessant ageing. <span class="target" id="page-pts-450"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-450"><span class="std std-ref">450</span></a></span></p>
<p id="xiv-69"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-69"><span class="std std-ref">§69</span></a> <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-452"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-452"><span class="std std-ref">452</span></a>/510</span> <em>23. Impermanence of matter</em> has the characteristic of complete breaking up. Its function is to make material instances subside. It is manifested as destruction and fall (cf. <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>§645</em>). Its proximate cause is matter that is completely breaking up.</p>
<p id="xiv-70"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-70"><span class="std std-ref">§70</span></a> <em>24. Physical nutriment</em> has the characteristic of nutritive essence. Its function is to feed kinds of matter. It is manifested as consolidating. Its proximate cause is a physical basis that must be fed with physical food. It is a term for the nutritive essence by means of which living beings sustain themselves (cf. <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>§646</em>).</p>
<p id="xiv-71"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-71"><span class="std std-ref">§71</span></a> These, firstly, are the material instances that have been handed down in the texts. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id114" id="id30" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>30<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> But in the Commentary, others have been added as follows: matter as power, matter as procreation, matter as birth, matter as sickness; and, in the opinion of some, matter as torpor. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id115" id="id31" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>31<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>In the first place, <em>matter as torpor</em> is rejected as non-existent by the words:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Surely thou art a sage enlightened,</div>
<div class="line">There are no hindrances in thee (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Sn"><span class="xref std std-term">Sn</span></a> <em>541</em>).</div>
</div>
<p>As to the rest, <em>matter as sickness</em> is included by ageing and by impermanence; <em>matter as birth</em> by growth and continuity; <em>matter as procreation</em>, by the water element; and <em>matter as power</em> by the air element. So taken separately not even one of these exists: this was the agreement reached.</p>
<p>So this derived matter of twenty-four sorts and the aforesaid matter of the primary elements, which is of four sorts, together amount to twenty-eight sorts, neither more nor less.</p>
<p id="xiv-72"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-72"><span class="std std-ref">§72</span></a> And all that [matter of twenty-eight sorts] is of one kind as “not-root-cause, root-causeless, dissociated from root-cause, with conditions, mundane, subject to cankers” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>§584</em>), and so on.</p>
<p>It is of two kinds as internal and external, gross and subtle, far and near, produced (<em>nipphanna</em>) and unproduced, sensitive matter and insensitive matter, faculty and non-faculty, clung to and not-clung to, and so on.</p>
<p id="xiv-73"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-73"><span class="std std-ref">§73</span></a> Herein, the five kinds beginning with the eye are <em>internal</em> because they occur as an integral part of the selfhood (in oneself); the rest are <em>external</em> because they are external to that selfhood (personality). The nine beginning with the eye and the three elements excepting the water element, making twelve kinds in all, are to be taken as <em>gross</em> because of impinging; the rest are <em>subtle</em> because they are the opposite of that. What is subtle is <em>far</em> because it is difficult to penetrate, the other is <em>near</em> because it is easy to penetrate. The eighteen kinds of matter, that is to say, the four elements, the thirteen beginning with the eye, and physical nutriment, are produced because they can be discerned through their own individual essences, having exceeded the [purely conceptual] states of [matter as] delimitation, [matter as] alteration, and [matter as] characteristic (see <a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-77"><span class="std std-ref">§77</span></a>); the rest, being the opposite, are <em>unproduced</em>. The five kinds beginning with the <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-453"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-453"><span class="std std-ref">453</span></a>/511</span> eye are <em>sensitive matter</em> through their being conditions for the apprehension of visible data, etc., because they are, as it were, bright like the surface of a looking glass; the rest are <em>insensitive matter</em> because they are the opposite of that. <span class="target" id="page-pts-451"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-451"><span class="std std-ref">451</span></a></span>  Sensitive matter itself, together with the three beginning with the femininity faculty, is <em>faculty</em> in the sense of predominance; the rest are <em>not-faculty</em> because they are the opposite of that. What we shall later describe as “kamma-born” (<a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-75"><span class="std std-ref">§75</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="ch-20.xhtml#xx-27"><span class="std std-ref">XX.27</span></a>) is <em>clung</em> to because that is “clung to,” [that is, acquired] by kamma. The rest are <em>not-clung</em> to because they are the opposite of that.</p>
<p id="xiv-74"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-74"><span class="std std-ref">§74</span></a> Again, all matter is of three kinds according to the visible (<em>sanidassana</em>) triad, the kamma-born triad, etc. (see <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>2</em>). Herein, as regards the gross, a visible datum is visible with impact; the rest are invisible with impact; all the subtle kinds are invisible without impact. So firstly it is of three kinds according to the visible triad.</p>
<p id="xiv-75"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-75"><span class="std std-ref">§75</span></a> According to the kamma-born triad, etc., however, that born from kamma is <em>kamma-born</em>; that born from a condition other than that is <em>not-kamma-born</em>; that not born from anything is <em>neither-kamma-born-nor-not-kamma-born</em>.</p>
<p>That born from consciousness is <em>consciousness-born</em>; that born from a condition other than consciousness is <em>not-consciousness-born</em>; that not born from anything is <em>neither-consciousness-born-nor-not-consciousness-born</em>.</p>
<p>That born from nutriment is <em>nutriment-born</em>; that born from a condition other than that is <em>not-nutriment-born</em>; that not born from anything is <em>neither-nutriment-born-nor-not-nutriment-born</em>.</p>
<p>That born from temperature is <em>temperature-born</em>; that born from a condition other than that is <em>not-temperature-born</em>; that not born from anything is <em>neither-temperature-born-nor-not-temperature-born</em>.</p>
<p>So it is of three kinds according to the kamma-born triad, and so on.</p>
<p id="xiv-76"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-76"><span class="std std-ref">§76</span></a> Again, it is of four kinds as seen, etc., as concrete matter, etc., and as the physical basis tetrads, and so on.</p>
<p>Herein, the visible-data base is <em>seen</em> because it is the objective field of seeing. The sound base is <em>heard</em> because it is the objective field of hearing. The three, that is to say, odours, flavours, and tangible data, are <em>sensed</em> (lit. contacted) because they are the objective fields of faculties that take contiguous [objective fields]. The rest are <em>cognized</em> because they are the objective field of consciousness (cognition) only. So firstly it is of four kinds according to the seen, etc., tetrad. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id116" id="id32" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>32<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="xiv-77"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-77"><span class="std std-ref">§77</span></a> <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-454"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-454"><span class="std std-ref">454</span></a>/512</span> Here, however, “produced matter” is <em>concrete matter</em>; the space-element is <em>delimiting matter</em>; those from “bodily intimation” up to “wieldiness” are <em>matter as alteration</em>; birth, ageing and dissolution are <em>matter as characteristic</em>. So it is of four kinds as concrete matter and so on.</p>
<p id="xiv-78"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-78"><span class="std std-ref">§78</span></a> Here, however, what is called the materiality of the heart is <em>physical basis, not door</em> (see <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs-a"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs-a</span></a> <em>82f.</em>); the two intimations are <em>door, not physical basis</em>; sensitive matter is <em>both physical basis and door</em>; the rest are <em>neither physical basis nor door</em>. So it is four kinds according to the physical basis tetrad.</p>
<p id="xiv-79"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-79"><span class="std std-ref">§79</span></a> Again, it is of five kinds as born of one, born of two, born of three, born of four, and not born of anything.</p>
<p>Herein, what is kamma-born only or consciousness-born only is called <em>born of one</em>. Of these, materiality of the faculties, together with the heart-basis, is kamma-born only; the two intimations are consciousness-born only. But what is born [now] of consciousness and [now] of temperature is called <em>born of two</em>. That is the sound base only. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id117" id="id33" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>33<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> What is born of temperature, consciousness, and nutriment <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-455"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-455"><span class="std std-ref">455</span></a>/513</span> <span class="target" id="page-pts-452"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-452"><span class="std std-ref">452</span></a></span>  is called <em>born of three</em>. But that is the three beginning with “lightness” only. What is born from the four beginning with kamma is called <em>born of four</em>. That is all the rest except “matter as characteristic.”</p>
<p id="xiv-80"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-80"><span class="std std-ref">§80</span></a> But “matter as characteristic” is called <em>not born of anything</em>. Why? Because there is no arising of arising, and the other two are the mere maturing and breakup of what has arisen. Though in the passage, “The visible-data base, the sound base, the odour base, the flavour base, the tangible-data base, the space element, the water element, lightness of matter, malleability of matter, wieldiness of matter, growth of matter, continuity of matter, and physical food—these states are consciousness-originated” (cf. <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>§667</em>) and so on, a state of birth [that is, growth] being born from somewhere can be understood as allowable since the point of view here is the moment when the conditions that are giving birth to the kinds of materiality are exercising their function.</p>
<p>This, firstly, is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the materiality aggregate.</p>

<p id="xiv-82"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-82"><span class="std std-ref">§82</span></a> “Whatever has the characteristic of cognizing should be understood, all taken together, as the consciousness aggregate” was said above. And what has the characteristic of cognizing (<em>vijānana</em>)? Consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>); according as it is said, “It cognizes, friend, that is why ‘consciousness’ is said” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>I 292</em>).

<p id="xiv-84"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-84"><span class="std std-ref">§84</span></a> (1) When a man is happy on encountering an excellent gift to be given, or recipient, etc., or some such cause for joy, and by placing right view foremost that occurs in the way beginning “There is [merit in] giving” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>I 288</em>), he unhesitatingly and unurged by others performs such merit as giving, etc., then his consciousness is <em>accompanied by joy, associated with knowledge, and unprompted</em>. (2) But when a man is happy and content in the way aforesaid, and, while placing right view foremost, yet he does it hesitantly through lack of free generosity, etc., or urged on by others, then his consciousness is of the same kind as the last but <em>prompted</em>; for in this sense “prompting” is a term for a prior effort exerted by himself or others</p>
<p id="xiv-85"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-85"><span class="std std-ref">§85</span></a> (3) But when young children have a natural habit due to seeing the behaviour of relatives and are joyful on seeing bhikkhus and at once give them whatever they have in their hands or pay homage, then the third kind of consciousness arises. (4) But when they behave like this on being urged by their relatives, “Give; pay homage,” then the fourth kind of consciousness arises. (5)–(8) But when the consciousnesses are devoid of joy in these four instances through encountering no excellence in the gift to be given, or in the recipient, etc., or through want of any such cause for joy, then the remaining four, which are <em>accompanied by equanimity</em>, arise.</p>
<p>So sense-sphere profitable [consciousness] should be understood as of eight kinds, being classed according to joy, equanimity, knowledge, and prompting.</p>
<p id="xiv-86"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-86"><span class="std std-ref">§86</span></a> I. B. The consciousness of the fine-material sphere is fivefold, being classed according to association with the jhāna factors. That is to say, (9) the first is associated with applied thought, sustained thought, happiness, bliss, and concentration, (10) the second leaves out applied thought from that, (11) the third leaves out sustained thought from that, (12) the fourth makes happiness fade away from that, (13) the fifth is associated with equanimity and concentration, bliss having subsided.</p>
<p id="xiv-87"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-87"><span class="std std-ref">§87</span></a> I. C. That of the <em>immaterial sphere</em> is fourfold by association with the four immaterial states; for (14) the first is associated with the jhāna of the base consisting of boundless space in the way aforesaid, while (15)–(17) the second, third, and fourth, are [respectively] associated with those of the base consisting of boundless consciousness, and so on.</p>
<p id="xiv-88"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-88"><span class="std std-ref">§88</span></a> I. D. The <em>supramundane</em> is fourfold (18)–(21) by association with the four paths.</p>

<h5>2.2.1.2 II. Unprofitable</h5>
<p id="xiv-89"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-89"><span class="std std-ref">§89</span></a> II. The <em>unprofitable</em> is one kind according to plane, being only of the sense sphere. It is of three kinds according to root, as (a) rooted in greed, (b) rooted in hate, and (c) rooted in delusion.</p>
<p id="xiv-90"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-90"><span class="std std-ref">§90</span></a> II. (a) Herein, (22)–(29) that <em>rooted in greed</em> is of eight kinds, being classed according to joy, equanimity, [false] view, and prompting, that is to say: (22) when accompanied by joy it is either associated-with-[false-]view and unprompted, or (23) prompted; or (24) it is dissociated-from-[false-]view and likewise [unprompted or (25) prompted]; and (26) when accompanied-by-equanimity it is either associated-with-[false-]view and unprompted, or (27) prompted; or (28) it is dissociated-from-[false-]view and likewise [unprompted, or (29) prompted].</p>
<p id="xiv-91"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-91"><span class="std std-ref">§91</span></a> (22) When a man is happy and content in placing wrong view foremost of the sort beginning “There is no danger in sense desires” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>I 307</em>), and either enjoys sense desires with consciousness that in its own individual essence is eager without being urged, or believes auspicious sights, etc., have a [real substantial] core, then the first kind of unprofitable consciousness arises (23); when it is with consciousness that is sluggish and urged on, then it is the second kind (24). But when a man is happy and content only, without placing wrong view foremost, and indulges in sexual intercourse, or covets others’ good fortune, or steals others’ goods, with consciousness that in its own individual essence is eager without being urged, then it is the third kind (25). When it is with consciousness that is sluggish and urged on, then it is the fourth kind (26)–(29). But when the consciousnesses are devoid of joy in these four instances through encountering no excellence in the sense desires, or through want of any such cause for joy, then the remaining four, which are accompanied by equanimity, arise.</p>
<p>So that rooted in greed should be understood as of eight kinds, being classed according to joy, equanimity, [false] view and prompting.</p>
<p id="xiv-92"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-92"><span class="std std-ref">§92</span></a> II. (b) That <em>rooted in hate</em> is of two kinds: (30)–(31) being <em>accompanied-by-grief</em> and <em>associated-with-resentment</em>, it is either <em>prompted</em> or <em>unprompted</em>. It should be understood to occur at the times when [consciousness] is either keen [if unprompted] or sluggish [if prompted] in the killing of living things, and so on.</p>
<p id="xiv-93"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-93"><span class="std std-ref">§93</span></a> II. (c) That <em>rooted in delusion</em> is of two kinds: (32)–(33) being <em>accompanied-by-equanimity</em>, it is either associated-with uncertainty or associated-with-agitation. It should be understood to occur at the time of indecision or of distraction.</p>
<p>So unprofitable consciousness is of twelve kinds.</p>

<h5>2.2.1.3 III. Indeterminate</h5>
<p id="xiv-94"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-94"><span class="std std-ref">§94</span></a> III. The <em>indeterminate</em> is of two kinds: (i) resultant and (ii) functional. Herein, III. i. <em>resultant</em> is of four kinds according to plane; namely, (A) of the sense sphere, (B) of the fine-material sphere, (C) of the immaterial sphere, and (D) supramundane. Herein, III. i. A. that of the <em>sense sphere</em> is of two kinds, namely, (a) profitable result and (b) unprofitable result. And III. i. A. (a) the <em>profitable resultant</em> is of two kinds, namely, (1) without root-cause and (2) with root-cause.</p>
<p><strong>[III. i. Resultant]</strong></p>
<p id="xiv-95"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-95"><span class="std std-ref">§95</span></a> III. i. A. (a) i. Herein, that <em>without root-cause</em> is that devoid of non-greed, etc., as the cause of result. It is of eight kinds as (34) eye-consciousness (35)–(38), <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-459"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-459"><span class="std std-ref">459</span></a>/517</span> ear-, nose-, tongue-, and body-consciousness (39), mind-element with the function of receiving (40)–(41), the two mind-consciousness-elements with the functions of investigating, and so on. <span class="target" id="page-pts-455"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-455"><span class="std std-ref">455</span></a></span></p>
<p id="xiv-96"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-96"><span class="std std-ref">§96</span></a> Herein, (34) <em>eye-consciousness</em> has the characteristic of being supported by the eye and cognizing visible data. Its function is to have only visible data as its object. It is manifested as occupation with visible data. Its proximate cause is the departure of (70) the functional mind-element that has visible data as its object.</p>
<p>(35)–(38) <em>Ear-, nose-, tongue-</em>, and <em>body-consciousness</em> [respectively] have the characteristic of being supported by the ear, etc., and of cognizing sounds, and so on. Their functions are to have only sounds, etc., as their [respective] objects. They are manifested as occupation with [respectively] sounds, and so on. Their proximate cause is the departure of (70) the functional mind-element that has [respectively] sounds, etc., as its object.</p>
<p id="xiv-97"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-97"><span class="std std-ref">§97</span></a> (39) [The resultant] <em>mind-element</em> has the characteristic of cognizing [respectively] visible data, etc., immediately next to (34)–(38) eye-consciousness, and so on. Its function is to receive visible data, and so on. It is manifested as the state [of receiving] corresponding to that [last-mentioned function]. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id121" id="id37" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>37<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> Its proximate cause is the departure of eye-consciousness, and so on.</p>
<p>(40)–(41) Also the twofold resultant <em>mind-consciousness-element without root-cause</em> with the function of investigating, etc., has as its characteristic the cognizing of the six kinds of objects. Its function is that of investigating, and so on. It is manifested as the state [of investigating] corresponding to that [last-mentioned function]. Its proximate cause is the heart-basis.</p>
<p id="xiv-98"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-98"><span class="std std-ref">§98</span></a> But it is classed according to its association with joy or with equanimity, and according to its being divisible into that with two positions and that with five positions [in the cognitive series]. For of these, (40) one is associated-with-joy because of its presence when entirely desirable objects occur; and it has two positions [in the cognitive series] because it occurs as investigating at the five doors and as registration at the end of impulsion. (41) The other kind is associated-with-equanimity because of its presence when desirable-neutral objects occur, and it has five positions since it occurs as investigation, registration, rebirth-linking, life-continuum, and death.</p>
<p id="xiv-99"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-99"><span class="std std-ref">§99</span></a> And this eightfold resultant consciousness without root-cause is of two kinds as well because of having an invariable object and a variable object. It is of three kinds as classed according to [bodily] pleasure, [mental] joy, and equanimity. For (34)–(38) the five consciousnesses have each an invariable object since they occur respectively only with respect to visible data, and so on. The others (39)–(41) have a variable object. For here (39) the mind-element occurs with respect to the five beginning with visible data, and (40)–(41) the two mind-consciousness-elements <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-460"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-460"><span class="std std-ref">460</span></a>/518</span> occur with respect to [all] six. Here, however, body-consciousness is associated with [bodily] pleasure. The mind-consciousness-element (40) with two positions is associated with [mental] joy; the other (41) is associated with equanimity.</p>
<p>So firstly, the profitable resultant without root-cause should be understood as of eight kinds.</p>
<p id="xiv-100"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-100"><span class="std std-ref">§100</span></a> III. i. A. (a) 2. But that with root-cause is (42)–(49) that associated with non-greed, etc., as the cause of the result. It is of eight kinds because it is classed according to joy, etc., like the profitable of the sense sphere (1)–(8). But it does not occur with respect to the six objects <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id122" id="id38" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>38<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> through giving, etc., as the profitable does; for it occurs only with respect to the six objects that are included among limited states, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id123" id="id39" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>39<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> as rebirth-linking, life-continuum, death, and registration. But the prompted and unprompted states should be understood here as due to the source it has come from, and so on. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id124" id="id40" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>40<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a><span class="target" id="page-pts-456"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-456"><span class="std std-ref">456</span></a></span>  And while there is no difference in the associated states, the resultant should be understood as passive like the reflection of a face in a looking-glass while the profitable is active like the face.</p>
<p id="xiv-101"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-101"><span class="std std-ref">§101</span></a> III. i. A. (b) Unprofitable resultant, though, is without root-cause only. It is of seven kinds as (50) eye-consciousness, (51)–(54) ear-, nose-, tongue-, and body-consciousness, (55) mind-element with the function of receiving, and (56) mind-consciousness-element with the function of investigating, etc., and having five positions. It should be understood as to characteristic, etc., in the same way as the profitable resultant without root-cause (34)–(41).</p>
<p id="xiv-102"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-102"><span class="std std-ref">§102</span></a> Profitable resultant, though, has desirable or desirable-neutral objects only, while these have undesirable or undesirable-neutral objects only. The former are of three kinds, being classed according to equanimity, bodily pleasure, and mental joy, while these are of two kinds, being classed according to bodily pain and equanimity. For here it is only body-consciousness that is accompanied by bodily pain; the rest are accompanied by equanimity. And the equanimity in these is inferior, and not very sharp as the pain is; while in the former it is superior, and not very sharp as the pleasure is.</p>
<p>So with these seven kinds of unprofitable resultant and the previous sixteen kinds of profitable resultant, sense-sphere resultant consciousness is of twenty-three kinds.</p>
<p id="xiv-103"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-103"><span class="std std-ref">§103</span></a> <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-461"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-461"><span class="std std-ref">461</span></a>/519</span> III. i. B. That of the <em>fine-material sphere</em>, however, is of five kinds (57)–(61) like the profitable (9)–(13). But the profitable occurs in a cognitive series with the impulsions as an attainment [of jhāna], while this occurs in an existence [in the fine-material sphere] as rebirth-linking, life-continuum, and death.</p>
<p id="xiv-104"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-104"><span class="std std-ref">§104</span></a> III. i. C. And as that of the fine-material sphere [was like the profitable of that sphere] so that of the <em>immaterial sphere</em> (62)–(65) is of four kinds like the profitable too (14)–(17). And its occurrence is classed in the same way as that of the fine-material sphere.</p>
<p id="xiv-105"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-105"><span class="std std-ref">§105</span></a> III. i. D. The <em>supramundane resultant</em> is of four kinds (66)–(69) because it is [respectively] the fruitions of the consciousnesses associated with the four paths (18)–(21). It occurs in two ways, that is to say, as [fruition in] the cognitive series of the path and as fruition attainment (see <a class="reference internal" href="ch-22.xhtml#xxii"><span class="std std-ref">Ch. XXII</span></a>).</p>
<p>So resultant consciousness in all the four planes is of thirty-six kinds.</p>
<p><strong>[III. ii. Functional]</strong></p>
<p id="xiv-106"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-106"><span class="std std-ref">§106</span></a> III. ii. The functional, however, is of three kinds according to plane: (A) of the sense sphere, (B) of the fine-material sphere, (C) of the immaterial sphere. Herein, III. ii. A., that of the sense sphere, is of two kinds, namely, (1) without root-cause, and (2) with root-cause.</p>
<p>III. ii. A. 1. Herein, that without root-cause is that devoid of non-greed, etc., as the cause of result. That is of two kinds, being classed as (70) mind-element, and (71)–(72) mind-consciousness-element.</p>
<p id="xiv-107"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-107"><span class="std std-ref">§107</span></a> Herein, (70) the <em>mind-element</em> has the characteristics of being the forerunner of eye-consciousness, etc., and of cognizing visible data and so on. Its function is to advert. It is manifested as confrontation of visible data, and so on. Its proximate cause is the interruption of [the continued occurrence of consciousness as] life-continuum. It is associated with equanimity only.</p>
<p id="xiv-108"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-108"><span class="std std-ref">§108</span></a> But the mind-consciousness-element is of two kinds, namely, shared by all and not shared by all. <span class="target" id="page-pts-457"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-457"><span class="std std-ref">457</span></a></span>  Herein, (71) that shared by all is the functional [mind-consciousness-element] accompanied by equanimity without root-cause. It has the characteristic of cognizing the six kinds of objects. Its function is to determine at the five doors and to advert at the mind door. It is manifested as the states [of determining and adverting] corresponding to those [last-mentioned two functions]. Its proximate cause is the departure either of the resultant mind-consciousness-element without root-cause (40)–(41) [in the first case], or of one among the kinds of life-continuum [in the second]. (72) That <em>not shared by all</em> is the functional [mind-consciousness-element] accompanied by joy without root-cause. It has the characteristic of cognizing the six kinds of objects. Its function is to cause smiling <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id125" id="id41" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>41<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> in Arahants about things that are not sublime. It is manifested as the state corresponding to that [last-mentioned function]. Its proximate cause is always the heart-basis.</p>
<p>So the sense-sphere functional without root-cause is of three kinds.</p>
<p id="xiv-109"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-109"><span class="std std-ref">§109</span></a> III. ii. A. 2. That, however, <em>with root cause</em> is of eight kinds (73)–(80), like the profitable (1)–(8), being classed according to joy and so on. While the profitable <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-462"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-462"><span class="std std-ref">462</span></a>/520</span> arises in trainers and ordinary men only, this arises in Arahants only. This is the difference here.</p>
<p>So firstly, that of the sense sphere is of eleven kinds.</p>
<p>III. ii. B., III. ii. C. That, however, of the <em>fine-material sphere</em> (81)–(85), and that of the <em>immaterial sphere</em> (86)–(89) are [respectively] of five kinds and of four kinds like the profitable. But they should be understood to differ from the profitable in that they arise only in Arahants.</p>
<p>So functional consciousness in the three planes is of twenty kinds in all.</p>
<p id="xiv-110"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-110"><span class="std std-ref">§110</span></a> So the 21 kinds of profitable, the 12 kinds of unprofitable, the 36 kinds of resultant, and the 20 kinds of functional, amount in all to 89 kinds of consciousness. And these occur in the fourteen modes of (a) rebirth-linking, (b) life-continuum, (c) adverting, (d) seeing, (e) hearing, (f) smelling, (g) tasting, (h) touching, (i) receiving, (j) investigating, (k) determining, (l) impulsion, (m) registration, and (n) death.</p>

<h4>2.2.2 The 14 Modes of Occurrence of Consciousness</h4>
<p id="xiv-111"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-111"><span class="std std-ref">§111</span></a> How so? (a) When, through the influence of the eight kinds of sense-sphere profitable [consciousness] (1)–(8), beings come to be reborn among deities and human beings, then the eight kinds of sense-sphere resultant with root-cause (42)–(49) occur, and also the resultant mind-consciousness-element without root-cause associated with equanimity (41), which is the weak profitable result with two root-causes in those who are entering upon the state of eunuchs, etc., among human beings—thus nine kinds of resultant consciousness in all occur as rebirth-linking; and they do so making their object whichever among the kamma, sign of kamma, or sign of destiny has appeared at the time of dying (see also <a class="reference internal" href="ch-17.xhtml#xvii-120"><span class="std std-ref">XVII.120</span></a>). <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id126" id="id42" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>42<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="xiv-112"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-112"><span class="std std-ref">§112</span></a> When, through the influence of the profitable of the fine-material sphere (9)–(13) and the immaterial sphere (14)–(17), beings are reborn [respectively] in the fine-material and immaterial kinds of becoming, then the nine kinds of fine-material (57)–(61) and immaterial (62)–(65) resultant occur as <em>rebirth-linking</em>; and they do so making their object only the sign of kamma that has appeared at the time of dying. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id127" id="id43" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>43<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p id="xiv-113"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-113"><span class="std std-ref">§113</span></a> When, through the influence of the unprofitable (22)–(33), they are reborn in a state of loss, then the one kind of unprofitable resultant mind-consciousness-element without root-cause (56) occurs as rebirth-linking; and it does so making its object whichever among the kamma, sign of kamma, and sign of destiny has appeared at the time of dying. <span class="target" id="page-pts-458"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-458"><span class="std std-ref">458</span></a></span></p>

<p id="xiv-114"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-114"><span class="std std-ref">§114</span></a> (b) When the rebirth-linking consciousness has ceased, then, following on whatever kind of rebirth-linking it may be, the same kinds, being the result of that same kamma whatever it may be, occur as life-continuum consciousness with that same object; and again those same kinds. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id128" id="id44" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>44<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> And as long as there is no other kind of arising of consciousness to interrupt the continuity, they also go on occurring endlessly in periods of dreamless sleep, etc., like the current of a river. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id129" id="id45" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>45<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>This is how the occurrence of those same [nineteen kinds of] consciousness should be understood as life-continuum.</p>
<p id="xiv-115"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-115"><span class="std std-ref">§115</span></a> (c) With the life-continuum continuity occurring thus, when living beings’ faculties have become capable of apprehending an object, then, when a visible datum has come into the eye’s focus, there is impinging upon the eye-sensitivity due to the visible datum. Thereupon, owing to the impact’s influence, there comes to be a disturbance in [the continuity of] the life-continuum. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id130" id="id46" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>46<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> Then, when the life-continuum has ceased, the functional mind-element (70) arises making that same visible datum its object, as it were, cutting off the life-continuum and accomplishing the function of <em>adverting</em>. So too in the case of the ear door and so on.</p>

Because of that it is called <em>registration</em> (*tadārammaṇa—*lit. “having-that-as-its-object”).</p>
<p>This is how the occurrence of eleven kinds of resultant consciousness should be understood as registration.</p>
<p id="xiv-123"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-123"><span class="std std-ref">§123</span></a> (n) At the end of registration the life-continuum resumes its occurrence.

For the last life-continuum consciousness of all in one becoming is called death (<em>cuti</em>) because of falling (<em>cavanatta</em>) from that [becoming]. So that is of nineteen kinds too [like rebirth-linking and life-continuum].</p>
<p>This is how the occurrence of nineteen kinds of resultant consciousness should be understood as death.</p>
<p id="xiv-124"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-124"><span class="std std-ref">§124</span></a> And after death there is rebirth-linking again; and after rebirth-linking, life-continuum. Thus the conscious continuity of beings who hasten through the kinds of becoming, destiny, station [of consciousness], and abode [of beings] occurs without break. But when a man attains Arahantship here, it ceases with the cessation of his death consciousness.</p>

It is manifested as the action of interpreting by means of the sign as apprehended, like the blind who “see” an elephant (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Ud"><span class="xref std std-term">Ud</span></a> <em>68–69</em>).

Herein, <em>conscience</em> has the characteristic of disgust at evil, while <em>shame</em> has the characteristic of dread of it. <em>Conscience</em> has the function of not doing evil and that in the mode of modesty, while <em>shame</em> has the function of not doing it and that in the mode of dread.

But these two states should be regarded as the guardians of the world (see <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-A"><span class="xref std std-term">A</span></a> <em>I 51</em>).</p>

Of these, <em>non-greed</em> has the characteristic of the mind’s lack of desire for an object, or it has the characteristic of non-adherence, like a water drop on a lotus leaf. Its function is not to lay hold, like a liberated bhikkhu. It is manifested as a state of not treating as a shelter, like that of a man who has fallen into filth. <em>Non-hate</em> has the characteristic of lack of savagery, or the characteristic of non-opposing, like a gentle friend. Its function is to remove annoyance, or its function is to remove fever, as sandalwood does. It is manifested as agreeableness, like the full moon. <em>Non-delusion</em> has the characteristic of penetrating [things] according to their individual essences, or it has the characteristic of sure penetration, like the penetration of an arrow shot by a skilful archer. Its function is to illuminate the objective field, like a lamp. It is manifested as non-bewilderment, like a guide in a forest.

But both tranquillity of that body and of consciousness have, together, the characteristic of quieting disturbance of that body and of consciousness.

<p id="xiv-146"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-146"><span class="std std-ref">§146</span></a> (xx)–(xxi) The malleable state of the [mental] body is <em>malleability of body</em>.

Their function is to crush tortuousness in the [mental] body and in consciousness. They are manifested as non-crookedness. Their proximate cause is the [mental] body and consciousness.

So that zeal has the characteristic of desire to act. Its function is scanning for an object. It is manifested as need for an object. That same [object] is its proximate cause. It should be regarded as the extending of the mental hand in the apprehending of an object.</p>
<p id="xiv-151"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-151"><span class="std std-ref">§151</span></a> (xxix) The act of resolving <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id150" id="id66" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>66<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>is <em>resolution</em>.

<p id="xiv-152"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-152"><span class="std std-ref">§152</span></a> (xxx) It is the maker of what is to be made, it is the maker in the mind (<em>manamhi kāro</em>), thus it is attention (<em>bringing-to-mind—manasi-kāra</em>). It makes the mind different from the previous [life-continuum] mind, thus it is attention. It has three ways of doing this: as the controller of the object, as the controller of the cognitive series, and as the controller of impulsions. Herein, the controller of <em>the object</em> is the maker in the mind, thus it is <em>attention</em>. That has the characteristic of conducting (<em>sāraṇa</em>). Its function is to yoke associated states to the object. It is manifested as confrontation with an object. Its proximate cause is an object. It should be regarded as the conductor (<em>sārathi</em>) of associated states by controlling the object, itself being included in the formations aggregate. <em>Controller of the cognitive series</em> is a term for five-door adverting (70). <em>Controller of impulsions</em> is a term for mind-door adverting (71). These last two are not included here.</p>
<p id="xiv-153"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-153"><span class="std std-ref">§153</span></a> (xxxi) <em>Specific neutrality</em> (*tatra-majjhattatā—*lit. “neutrality in regard thereto”) is neutrality (<em>majjhattatā</em>) in regard to those states [of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants arisen in association with it]. It has the characteristic of conveying consciousness and consciousness-concomitants evenly. Its function is to prevent deficiency and excess, <span class="target" id="page-pts-467"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-467"><span class="std std-ref">467</span></a></span>  or its function is to inhibit partiality.

<p id="xiv-154"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-154"><span class="std std-ref">§154</span></a> (xxxii)–(xxxiii) <em>Compassion</em> and <em>gladness</em> should be understood as given in the Description of the Divine Abodes (<a class="reference internal" href="ch-09.xhtml#ix-92"><span class="std std-ref">IX.§92</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="ch-09.xhtml#ix-94"><span class="std std-ref">94</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="ch-09.xhtml#ix-95"><span class="std std-ref">95</span></a>), except that those are of the fine-material sphere and have attained to absorption, while these are of the sense sphere. This is the only difference. Some, however, want to include among the inconstant both loving-kindness and equanimity. That cannot be accepted for, as to meaning, non-hate itself is loving-kindness, and specific neutrality is equanimity.</p>

But as regards characteristic, etc., these three have the characteristic of non-transgression in the respective fields of bodily conduct, etc.; they have the characteristic of not treading there, is what is said. Their function is to draw back from the fields of bodily misconduct, and so on. They are manifested as the not doing of these things. Their proximate causes are the special qualities of <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-475"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-475"><span class="std std-ref">475</span></a>/533</span> faith, conscience, shame, fewness of wishes, and so on.

<p id="xiv-156"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-156"><span class="std std-ref">§156</span></a> So these are the thirty-six formations that should be understood to come into association with the first profitable consciousness of the sense sphere (1). And as with the first, so with the second (2), the only difference here being promptedness.</p>

The paths classed as belonging to the second jhāna, etc., should be understood to be as stated in the cases [respectively] of the second fine-material-sphere jhāna, and so on (10)–(13).

Of these, <em>consciencelessness</em> has the characteristic of absence of disgust at bodily misconduct, etc., or it has the characteristic of immodesty. <em>Shamelessness</em> has the characteristic of absence of dread on their account, or it has the characteristic of absence of anxiety about them.

<p id="xiv-162"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-162"><span class="std std-ref">§162</span></a> Of these, <em>greed</em> has the characteristic of grasping an object, like birdlime (lit. “monkey lime”). Its function is sticking, like meat put in a hot pan. It is manifested as not giving up, like the dye of lamp-black. Its proximate cause is seeing enjoyment in things that lead to bondage. Swelling with the current of craving, it should be regarded as taking [beings] with it to states of loss, as a swift-flowing river does to the great ocean.</p>
<p id="xiv-163"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-163"><span class="std std-ref">§163</span></a> <em>Delusion</em> has the characteristic of blindness, or it has the characteristic of unknowing. Its function is non-penetration, or its function is to conceal the individual essence of an object. It is manifested as the absence of right theory (see <a class="reference internal" href="ch-17.xhtml#xvii-52"><span class="std std-ref">Ch. XVII, §52</span></a>), or it is manifested as darkness. Its proximate cause is unwise (unjustified) attention. It should be regarded as the root of all that is unprofitable.</p>

<p>So these are the seventeen formations that should be understood to come into association with the first unprofitable consciousness (22).</p>
<p>(23) And as with the first, so with the second (23), but here the difference is promptedness and inconstant [occurrence] of (xliii) stiffening and torpor.</p>
<p id="xiv-167"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-167"><span class="std std-ref">§167</span></a> Herein, (xliii) stiffening (<em>thīnanatā</em>) is stiffness (<em>thīna</em>); making torpid (<em>middhanatā</em>) is torpor (<em>middha</em>). The meaning is, paralysis due to lack of urgency, and loss of vigour. The compound <em>thīnamiddha</em> (<em>stiffness-and-torpor</em>) should be resolved into <em>thīnañ ca middhañ ca</em>. Herein, <em>stiffness</em> has the characteristic of lack of driving power. Its function is to remove energy. It is manifested as subsiding. <em>Torpor</em> has the characteristic of unwieldiness.

<p>That [pride] has the characteristic of haughtiness. Its function is arrogance. It is manifested as vain gloriousness. Its proximate cause is greed dissociated from views. It should be regarded as like madness.</p>
<p>(25) With the fourth (25) should be understood to be associated those given for the second (23), excepting wrong view (xli). And here pride (xliv) is among the inconstant too.</p>

But the aggregates have been given in detail by the Blessed One [in the Suttanta-Bhājaniya] in this way: “Any materiality whatever, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: all that together in the mass and in the gross is called the materiality aggregate. Any feeling whatever … Any perception whatever … Any formations whatever … Any consciousness whatever, whether past, future or present … all that together in the mass and in the gross is called the consciousness aggregate” (Vibh 1–9; cf. <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>III 17</em>).</p>

<p id="xiv-186"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-186"><span class="std std-ref">§186</span></a> Herein, the word <em>whatever</em> includes without exception. <em>Materiality</em> prevents over-generalization.

Then he undertakes its exposition as <em>past, future</em> and <em>present</em>, etc.; for some of it is classed as past and some as future, and so on. So also in the case of feeling, and so on.</p>
<p>Herein, the materiality called (i) <em>past</em> is fourfold, according to (a) extent, (b) continuity, (c) period, and (d) moment. Likewise (ii) the <em>future</em> and (iii) the <em>present</em>. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id155" id="id71" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>71<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

That which is born of consciousness and has its origination in one cognitive series, in one impulsion, in one attainment, is <em>present</em>. Previous to that is <em>past</em>. Subsequent to that is <em>future</em>. There is no special classification into past continuity, etc., of that which has its origination in kamma, but its pastness, etc., should be understood according as it supports those which have their origination through temperature, nutriment, and consciousness.</p>
<p id="xiv-189"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-189"><span class="std std-ref">§189</span></a> (c) <em>According to period</em>: any period among those such as one minute, morning, evening, day-and-night, etc., that occurs as a continuity, is called <em>present</em>.

<p id="xiv-190"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-190"><span class="std std-ref">§190</span></a> (d) <em>According to moment</em>: what is included in the trio of moments, [that is to say, arising, presence, and dissolution] beginning with arising is called <em>present</em>.

<p id="xiv-192"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-192"><span class="std std-ref">§192</span></a> (iv)–(v) The division into <em>internal and external</em> is as already stated (<a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-73"><span class="std std-ref">§73</span></a>).

That same materiality [of the Sudassin deities] is superior to the materiality of the Sudassa deities. Thus, firstly, should inferiority and superiority be understood figuratively (relatively) down as far as the denizens of hell. But absolutely (literally) it is inferior where it arises as unprofitable result, and it is superior where it arises as profitable result. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id160" id="id76" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>76<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

<p id="xiv-195"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-195"><span class="std std-ref">§195</span></a> <em>All that together in the mass and in the gross</em>: by making all that materiality, separately described by the words “past,” etc., into a collection by understanding its oneness, in other words, its characteristic of being molested (<em>ruppana</em>), it comes to be called the materiality (<em>rūpa</em>) aggregate.

<p id="xiv-196"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-196"><span class="std std-ref">§196</span></a> By this, too, it is shown that the materiality aggregate is all materiality, which all comes into the collection with the characteristic of being molested; for there is no materiality aggregate apart from materiality. <span class="target" id="page-pts-474"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-474"><span class="std std-ref">474</span></a></span></p>

<p>Herein, <em>according to continuity</em>, that included in a single cognitive series, a single impulsion, a single attainment, and that occurring in association with an objective field of one kind, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id161" id="id77" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>77<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> is <em>present</em>. Before that is <em>past</em>. Subsequent is <em>future</em>.</p>
<p><em>According to moment</em>, etc.: that feeling included in the trio of moments, which is in between the past time and the future time, and which is performing its own function, is <em>present</em>. Before that is <em>past</em>. Subsequent is <em>future</em>.</p>
<p id="xiv-198"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-198"><span class="std std-ref">§198</span></a> (iv)–(v)The classification into <em>internal</em> and <em>external</em> should be understood according to the internal in the sense of one’s own.</p>
<p>(vi)–(vii) The classification into <em>gross</em> and <em>subtle</em> should be understood (a) according to kind, (b) individual essence, (c) person, and (d) the mundane and supramundane, as stated in the Vibhaṅga in the way beginning “Unprofitable feeling is gross, profitable and indeterminate feeling is subtle, [profitable and unprofitable feeling is gross, indeterminate feeling is subtle]” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vibh"><span class="xref std std-term">Vibh</span></a> <em>3</em>), and so on.</p>
<p id="xiv-199"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-199"><span class="std std-ref">§199</span></a> (a) <em>According to kind</em>, firstly: unprofitable feeling is a state of disquiet, because it is the cause of reprehensible actions and because it produces burning of defilement, so it is <em>gross</em> [compared] with profitable feeling. And because it is accompanied by interestedness and drive and result, and because of the burning of the defilements, and because it is reprehensible, it is gross compared with resultant indeterminate. Also because it is accompanied by result, because of the burning of the defilements, and because it is attended by affliction and is reprehensible, it is gross compared with functional indeterminate. But in the opposite sense profitable and indeterminate feeling are subtle compared with unprofitable feeling. Also the two, that is, profitable and unprofitable feeling, involve interestedness, drive and result, so they are respectively gross compared with the twofold indeterminate. And in the opposite sense the twofold indeterminate is subtle compared with them. This, firstly, is how grossness and subtlety should be understood according to kind.</p>
<p id="xiv-200"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-200"><span class="std std-ref">§200</span></a> (b) <em>According to individual essence</em>: painful feeling is gross compared with the others because it is without enjoyment, it involves intervention, causes disturbance, creates anxiety, and is overpowering. The other two are subtle compared with the painful because they are satisfying, peaceful, and superior, and respectively agreeable and neutral. Both the pleasant and the painful are gross compared with the neither-painful-nor-pleasant because they involve intervention, cause disturbance and are obvious. The latter is subtle in the way <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-485"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-485"><span class="std std-ref">485</span></a>/543</span> aforesaid compared with both the former. Thus should grossness and subtlety be understood according to individual essence.</p>
<p id="xiv-201"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-201"><span class="std std-ref">§201</span></a> (c) <em>According to person</em>: feeling in one who has no attainment is gross compared with that in one who has one, because it is distracted by a multiple object. In the opposite sense the other is subtle. This is how grossness and subtlety should be understood according to person. <span class="target" id="page-pts-475"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-475"><span class="std std-ref">475</span></a></span></p>
<p id="xiv-202"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-202"><span class="std std-ref">§202</span></a> (d) <em>According to the mundane and supramundane</em>: feeling subject to cankers is mundane, and that is gross compared with that free from cankers, because it is the cause for the arising of cankers, is liable to the floods, liable to the bonds, liable to the ties, liable to the hindrances, liable to the clingings, defilable, and shared by ordinary men. The latter, in the opposite sense, is subtle compared with that subject to cankers. This is how grossness and subtlety should be understood according to the mundane and supramundane.</p>
<p id="xiv-203"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-203"><span class="std std-ref">§203</span></a> Herein, one should beware of mixing up [the classifications] according to kind and so on. For although feeling associated with unprofitable resultant body-consciousness is subtle according to kind because it is indeterminate, it is nevertheless gross according to individual essence, and so on. And this is said: “Indeterminate feeling is subtle, painful feeling is gross. The feeling in one with an attainment is subtle, that in one with no attainment is gross. Feeling free from cankers is subtle, feeling accompanied by cankers is gross” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vibh"><span class="xref std std-term">Vibh</span></a> <em>3</em>). And like painful feeling, so also pleasant, etc., is gross according to kind and subtle according to individual essence.</p>
<p id="xiv-204"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-204"><span class="std std-ref">§204</span></a> Therefore feeling’s grossness and subtlety should be understood in such a way that there is no mixing up of the classifications according to kind and so on. For instance, [when it is said] “The indeterminate according to kind is subtle compared with the profitable and the unprofitable,” the individual-essence class, etc., must not be insisted upon like this: “Which kind of indeterminate? Is it the painful? Is it the pleasant? Is it that in one with an attainment? Is it that in one with no attainment? Is it that subject to cankers? Is it that free from cankers?” and so in each instance.</p>
<p id="xiv-205"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-205"><span class="std std-ref">§205</span></a> Furthermore, because of the words “Or feeling should be regarded as gross or subtle in comparison with this or that feeling” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vibh"><span class="xref std std-term">Vibh</span></a> <em>4</em>), among the unprofitable, etc., feeling accompanied by hate, too, is gross compared with that accompanied by greed because it burns up its own support, like a fire; and that accompanied by greed is subtle. Also, that accompanied by hate is gross when the hate is constant, and subtle when it is inconstant. And the constant is gross when giving result that lasts for the aeon, while the other is subtle. And of those giving result lasting for the aeon the unprompted is gross, while the other is subtle. But that accompanied by greed is gross when associated with [false] view, while the other is subtle. That also when constant and giving result lasting for the aeon and unprompted is gross, while the others are subtle. And without distinction the unprofitable with much result is gross, while that with little result is subtle. But the profitable with little result is gross, while that with much result is subtle.</p>
<p id="xiv-206"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-206"><span class="std std-ref">§206</span></a> <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-486"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-486"><span class="std std-ref">486</span></a>/544</span> Furthermore, the profitable of the sense sphere is gross; that of the fine-material sphere is subtle; next to which the immaterial, and next the supramundane [should be similarly compared]. That of the sense sphere is gross in giving, while it is subtle in virtue; next, that in development. Also, that in development is gross with two root-causes, while with three root-causes it is subtle. Also that with three root-causes is gross when prompted, while it is subtle when unprompted. That of the fine-material sphere is gross in the first jhāna, [while it is subtle in the second jhāna. That also of the second jhāna is gross] … of the fifth jhāna is subtle. And that of the immaterial sphere associated with the base consisting of boundless space is gross … <span class="target" id="page-pts-476"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-476"><span class="std std-ref">476</span></a></span>  that associated with the base consisting of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is subtle only. And the supramundane associated with the stream-entry path is gross … that associated with the Arahant path is subtle only. The same method applies also to resultant and functional feeling in the various planes and to feeling stated according to pain, etc., according to one with no attainment, etc., and according to that subject to cankers, and so on.</p>
<p id="xiv-207"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-207"><span class="std std-ref">§207</span></a> Then according to location, painful feelings in hell are gross, while in the animal generation they are subtle … Those among the Paranimmitavasavatti Deities are subtle only. And the pleasant should be construed throughout like the painful where suitable.</p>
<p id="xiv-208"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-208"><span class="std std-ref">§208</span></a> And according to physical basis, any feeling that has an inferior physical basis is gross, while one with a superior physical basis is subtle.</p>
<p>(viii)–(ix) What is gross should be regarded as <em>inferior</em> in the inferior-superior classification, and what is subtle <em>superior</em>.</p>
<p id="xiv-209"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-209"><span class="std std-ref">§209</span></a> [(x)–(xi) The word <em>far</em> is explained in the Vibhaṅga in the way beginning “The unprofitable is far from the profitable and indeterminate” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vibh"><span class="xref std std-term">Vibh</span></a> <em>4</em>) and the word <em>near</em> in the way beginning “Unprofitable feeling is near to unprofitable feeling” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vibh"><span class="xref std std-term">Vibh</span></a> <em>4</em>). Therefore, unprofitable feeling is far from the profitable and the indeterminate because of dissimilarity, unconnectedness, and non-resemblance. The profitable and the indeterminate are likewise far from the unprofitable. And so in all instances. But unprofitable feeling is near to unprofitable feeling because of similarity and resemblance.</p>

<p>Having understood this, again as regards these same aggregates:</p>

<div class="line">This is the way of exposition</div>

</div>
<p id="xiv-211"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-211"><span class="std std-ref">§211</span></a> <em>1.</em> Herein, <em>as to order</em>: order is of several kinds, namely, order of arising, order of abandoning, order of practice, order of plane, order of teaching.</p>
<p>Herein, “First there comes to be the foetus in the first stage, then there comes to be the foetus in the second stage” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>I 206</em>), etc., is <em>order of arising</em>. “Things to be abandoned by seeing, things to be abandoned by development” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>1</em>), etc., is <em>order of abandoning</em>. “Purification of virtue <span class="target" id="page-pts-477"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-477"><span class="std std-ref">477</span></a></span>  … purification of consciousness” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>I 148</em>), etc., is <em>order of practice</em>. “The sense sphere, the fine-material sphere” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patis"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭis</span></a> <em>I 83</em>), etc., is <em>order of plane</em>. “The four foundations of mindfulness, the four right efforts” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-D"><span class="xref std std-term">D</span></a> <em>II 120</em>), etc., or “Talk on giving, talk on virtue” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>I 379</em>), etc., is <em>order of teaching</em>.</p>
<p id="xiv-212"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-212"><span class="std std-ref">§212</span></a> Of these, firstly, <em>order of arising</em> is not applicable here because the aggregates do not arise in the order in which they are successively dealt with, as is the case with “the foetus in the first stage,” etc., nor is <em>order of abandoning</em> applicable, because the profitable and indeterminate are not to be abandoned; nor is <em>order of practice</em>, because what is unprofitable is not to be practiced; nor is <em>order of plane</em>, because feeling, etc., are included in all four planes.</p>
<p id="xiv-213"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-213"><span class="std std-ref">§213</span></a> <em>Order of teaching</em> is appropriate however; for there are those people who, while teachable, have fallen into assuming a self among the five aggregates owing to failure to analyze them; and the Blessed One is desirous of releasing them from the assumption by getting them to see how the [seeming] compactness of mass [in the five aggregates] is resolved; and being desirous of their welfare, he first, for the purpose of their easy apprehension, taught the materiality aggregate, which is gross, being the objective field of the eye, etc.; and after that, feeling, which feels matter as desirable and undesirable; then perception, which apprehends the aspects of feeling’s objective field, since “What one feels, that one perceives” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>I 293</em>); then formations, which form volitionally through the means of perception; and lastly, consciousness, which these things beginning with feeling have as their support, and which dominates them. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id162" id="id78" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>78<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>This, in the first place, is how the exposition should be known as to order.</p>
<p id="xiv-214"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-214"><span class="std std-ref">§214</span></a> <em>2. As to distinction</em>: as to the distinction between aggregates and aggregates-as-objects-of-clinging. But what is the distinction between them? Firstly, <em>aggregates</em> is said without distinguishing. <em>Aggregates [as objects] of clinging</em> is said distinguishing those that are subject to cankers and are liable to the clingings, according as it is said: “Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the five aggregates and the five aggregates [as objects] of clinging. Listen … And what, bhikkhus, are the five aggregates? Any kind of materiality whatever, bhikkhus, whether past, future or present … far or <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-488"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-488"><span class="std std-ref">488</span></a>/546</span> near: this is called the materiality aggregate. Any kind of feeling whatever … Any kind of perception whatever … Any kind of formations whatever … Any kind of consciousness whatever … far or near: this is called the consciousness aggregate. These, bhikkhus, are called the five aggregates. And what, bhikkhus, are the five aggregates [as objects] of clinging? Any kind of materiality whatever … far or near, that is subject to cankers and liable to the clingings: this is called the materiality aggregate [as object] of clinging. Any kind of feeling whatever … Any kind of perception whatever … Any kind of formations whatever … Any kind of consciousness whatever … far or near, that is subject to cankers and liable to the clingings: this is called the consciousness aggregate [as object] of clinging. These, bhikkhus, are called the five aggregates [as objects] of clinging” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>III 47</em>). <span class="target" id="page-pts-478"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-478"><span class="std std-ref">478</span></a></span></p>
<p id="xiv-215"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-215"><span class="std std-ref">§215</span></a> Now, while there is feeling, etc., both free from cankers [and subject to them], <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id163" id="id79" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>79<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> not so materiality. However, since materiality can be described as a [simple] aggregate in the sense of a total, it is therefore mentioned among the [simple] aggregates. And since it can be described as an aggregate [that is the object] of clinging in the sense of a total and in the sense of being subjected to cankers, that [same materiality] is therefore mentioned among the aggregates [as objects] of clinging too. But feeling, etc., are only mentioned among the [simple] aggregates when they are free from cankers. When they are subject to cankers, they are mentioned among the aggregates [as objects] of clinging. And here the meaning of the term “aggregates as objects of clinging” should be regarded as this: aggregates that are the resort of clinging are aggregates of clinging. But here all these taken together are intended as aggregates.</p>
<p id="xiv-216"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-216"><span class="std std-ref">§216</span></a> <em>3. As to neither less nor more</em>: but why are five aggregates, neither less nor more, mentioned by the Blessed One? (a) Because all formed things that resemble each other fall into these groups, (b) because that is the widest limit as the basis for the assumption of self and what pertains to self, and (c) because of the inclusion <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id164" id="id80" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>80<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> by them of the other sorts of aggregates.</p>
<p id="xiv-217"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-217"><span class="std std-ref">§217</span></a> (a) When the numerous categories of formed states are grouped together according to similarity, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id165" id="id81" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>81<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> materiality forms one aggregate through being grouped <span class="target" id="page-bps2011-489"></span> <span class="pb-tag-BPS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-bps2011-489"><span class="std std-ref">489</span></a>/547</span> together according to similarity consisting in materiality; feeling forms one aggregate through being grouped together according to similarity consisting in feeling; and so with perception and the other two. So they are stated as five because similar formed things fall into groups.</p>
<p id="xiv-218"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-218"><span class="std std-ref">§218</span></a> (b) And this is the extreme limit as the basis for the assumption of self and what pertains to self, that is to say, the five beginning with materiality. For this is said: “Bhikkhus, when matter exists, it is through clinging to matter, through insisting upon (interpreting) matter, that such a view as this arises: ‘This is mine, this is I, this is my self.’ When feeling exists … When perception exists … When formations exist … When consciousness exists, it is through clinging to consciousness, through insisting upon (interpreting) consciousness, that such a view as this arises: ‘This is mine, this is I, this is my self’”(<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>III 181–182</em>). So they are stated as five because this is the widest limit as a basis for the assumption of self and what pertains to self.</p>
<p id="xiv-219"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-219"><span class="std std-ref">§219</span></a> (c) And also, since those other [sorts of aggregates] stated as the five aggregates of things beginning with virtue <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id166" id="id82" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>82<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> are comprised within the formations aggregate, they are included here too. Therefore they are stated as five because they include the other sorts.</p>
<p>This is how the exposition should be known as to neither less nor more.</p>
<p id="xiv-220"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-220"><span class="std std-ref">§220</span></a> <em>4. As to simile</em>: the materiality aggregate [as object] of clinging is like a sick-room because it is the dwelling-place, as physical basis, door, and object, of the sick man, namely, the consciousness aggregate as object of clinging. The feeling aggregate as object of clinging is like the sickness because it afflicts. The perception aggregate as object of clinging is like the provocation of the sickness because it gives rise to feeling associated with greed, etc., owing to perception of sense desires, and so on. The formations aggregate as object of clinging is like having recourse to what is unsuitable because it is the source of feeling, which is the sickness; <span class="target" id="page-pts-479"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-479"><span class="std std-ref">479</span></a></span>  for it is said: “Feeling as feeling is the formed that they form” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>III 87</em>), and likewise: “Because of unprofitable kamma having been performed and stored up, resultant body-consciousness has arisen accompanied by pain” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>§556</em>). The consciousness aggregate as object of clinging is like the sick man because it is never free from feeling, which is the sickness.</p>
<p id="xiv-221"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-221"><span class="std std-ref">§221</span></a> Also they are (respectively) like the prison, the punishment, the offence, the punisher, and the offender. And they are like the dish, the food, the curry sauce [poured over the food], the server, and the eater. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id167" id="id83" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>83<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

<p id="xiv-222"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-222"><span class="std std-ref">§222</span></a> <em>5. Twice as to how to be seen</em>: the exposition should be known twice as to how to be seen, namely, in brief and in detail.</p>
<p id="xiv-223"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-223"><span class="std std-ref">§223</span></a> In brief [that is, collectively] the five aggregates as objects of clinging should be seen as an enemy with drawn sword (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>IV 174</em>) in the Snake Simile, as a burden (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>III 25</em>) according to the Burden Sutta, as a devourer (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>III 87</em>f) according to the To-be-devoured Discourse, and as impermanent, painful, not-self, formed, and murderous, according to the Yamaka Sutta (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>III 112</em>f).</p>

<p>In particular, even sublime internal materiality <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id168" id="id84" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>84<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> should be regarded as foul (ugly); feeling should be regarded as painful because it is never free from the three kinds of suffering (see <a class="reference internal" href="ch-16.xhtml#xvi-34"><span class="std std-ref">XVI.34</span></a>); perception and formations as not-self because they are unmanageable; and consciousness as impermanent because it has the nature of rise and fall.</p>
<p id="xiv-225"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-225"><span class="std std-ref">§225</span></a> <em>6. As to good for one seeing thus</em>: good comes to be accomplished in one who sees in the two ways thus in brief and in detail. And the way of definition should be known according to that, that is to say, firstly, one who sees the five aggregates as objects of clinging in the form of an enemy with drawn sword, etc., is not worried by the aggregates, but one who sees materiality, etc., in detail as a lump of froth, etc., is not one who sees a core in the coreless.</p>
<p id="xiv-226"><a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-226"><span class="std std-ref">§226</span></a> And in particular, <span class="target" id="page-pts-480"></span> <span class="pb-tag-PTS"><a class="reference internal" href="#page-pts-480"><span class="std std-ref">480</span></a></span>  one who sees internal materiality as foul (ugly) fully understands nutriment consisting of physical nutriment.

English does not always, as in this case, distinguish between the two. Similarly, for example, from the verb <em>socati</em> (he sorrows) we find <em>soka</em> (sorrow, state of sorrowing) and <em>socana</em> (sorrowing, act of sorrowing), and here the English differentiates.

<p><em>Paṭisambhidā</em> is usually rendered by “analysis” (see e.g. <em>Points of Controversy—Kathāvatthu</em> translation—pp. 377ff). But the Tipiṭaka explanations of the four <em>paṭisambhidā</em> suggest no emphasis on <em>analysis</em> rather than <em>synthesis.</em> <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> gives the following definition of the term: “Knowledge that is classified (<em>pabheda-gata</em> = put into a division) under meaning <em>(attha)</em> as capable of effecting the explanation and definition of specific characteristics of the meaning class (meaning division) is called <em>attha-paṭisambhidā;</em> and so with the other three” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>436</em>). “Discrimination” has been chosen for <em>paṭisambhidā</em> because, while it has the sense of “division,” it does not imply an opposite process as “analysis” does. Also it may be questioned whether the four are well described as “entirely logical”: “entirely epistemological” might perhaps be both less rigid and nearer; for they seem to cover four interlocking fields, namely: meanings of statements and effects of causes (etc.), statements of meanings and causes of effects (etc.), language as restricted to etymological rules of verbal expression, and clarity (or perspicuous inspiration) in marshalling the other three.</p>

<p>The word <em>abhinivisati</em> with its noun <em>abhinivesa</em> means literally “to dwell on,” and so “to adhere,” or “insist.” In the Tipiṭaka it always appears in a bad sense and always appears in contexts with wrong view and clinging (see e.g. <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>III 30–31</em>, <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Nidd"><span class="xref std std-term">Nidd</span></a> <em>I 436</em>, and also <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> quoted above at I. 140). However, in the Commentaries, the word appears also in a good sense as at <a class="reference internal" href="#xiv-130"><span class="std std-ref">XIV.130</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="ch-21.xhtml#xxi-73"><span class="std std-ref">XXI.73</span></a> and 83f., and at <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M-a"><span class="xref std std-term">M-a</span></a> <em>I 250</em> (cf. <em>saddhaṃ nivisati,</em> <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>II 173</em>). In this good sense it is synonymous with <em>right</em> interpretation of experience. All the bare experience of perception is interpreted by the mind either in the sense of permanence, pleasure, self, which is wrong because it is not confirmed by experience, or in the sense of impermanence, etc., which is right because it is confirmed by experience (see XIV. 130). There is no not interpreting experience, and it is a function of the mind that the interpretation adopted is “dwelt upon,” i.e. insisted upon. And so it is this insistence or interpretation in accordance with reality as confirmed by experience that is the <em>abhinivesa</em> of the Commentaries in the good sense. For these reasons the words <em>interpretation, misinterpretation</em> and <em>insistence</em> have been chosen here as renderings.</p>

<p>“Here the first-mentioned characteristic of the eye is described according to the kamma that produces a selfhood, and is common to all of it, and this without touching on differentiation is the cause. The second is according to the specialized kamma generated thus, “Let my eye be thus.” This is what they say. But it can be taken that the first-mentioned characteristic is stated as sensitivity’s interest in lighting up its own objective fields, the five senses’ state of sensitivity being taken as a generality; and that the second is stated as the seeing that is due to the particular division of its own cause, the sensitivities’ cause as the state of kamma being taken as a generality or as a unity. The same method applies to the ear and so on.</p>
<p>“Here it may be asked, ‘Is the arising of the faculties of the eye, etc., due to kamma that is one or to kamma that is different?’ Now, the Ancients say, “In both ways.” Herein, firstly, in the case of the arising of an eye, etc., due to kamma that is different there is nothing to be explained since the cause is divided up. But when their arising is due to kamma that is one, how does there come to be differentiation among them? It is due to dividedness in the cause too. For it is craving, in the form of longing for this or that kind of becoming that, itself having specific forms owing to hankering after the sense-bases included in some kind of becoming or other, contrives, acting as decisive-support, the specific divisions in the kamma that generates such a kind of becoming. As soon as the kamma has acquired the differentiation induced by that [hankering] it generates through effort consisting in appropriate ability a multiple fruit with differentiated individual essences, as though it had itself taken on a multiple form. And the ability here need not be understood as anything other than the able state; for it is simply the effort of producing fruit that is differentiated by the differentiation due to the differentiation in its cause. And the fact of this differentiating effort on the part of kamma that is one being the cause of the multiple faculties will be dealt with below as to logic and texts (note 21). Besides, it is told how one kind of consciousness only is the cause of the generation of the sixteen kinds of resultant consciousness and so on; and in the world it is also found that a single paddy seed is the cause of the generation of the ripe, the unripe, the husked, and the unhusked fruit. But what is the use of logical thinking? For the eye, etc., are the fruit of kamma; and kamma-result is exclusively the province of a Buddha’s knowledge” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>444</em>).</p>

<p>“If there is no differentiation according to primaries, what then is the reason for the differentiation of the eye, and so on? Though the kamma that is produced by the longing for a selfhood (individual personality) with five sense-bases is one only, still it should be taken as called <em>‘not common to them all’</em> and <em>‘difference of kamma’</em> because it is the cause of the differentiation of the eye, and so on. For it is not a condition for the ear through the same particular difference through which it is a condition for the eye, since, if it were, it would then follow that there was no distinction between the faculties. Because of the words, ‘At the moment of rebirth-linking, exalted volition is a condition, as kamma condition, for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed’ (Paṭṭh) it must be recognized that a single volition is kamma condition for all the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed that come into existence at the moment of rebirth-linking. For if the volition were different, then, when there came to be the arising of the faculties, it would follow that the materiality due to kamma performed was generated by limited and exalted kamma. And rebirth-linking that is one is not generated by a plurality of kinds of kamma. Thus it is established that the arising of the plurality of the faculties is due to a single kamma” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>446</em>).</p>

<p>See also §134 and notes 60, 61. The amplification in this paragraph is from Vism-mhṭ, which continues: “There is another method: the eye and the ear have non-contiguous objective fields because arising of consciousness is caused while their objective fields are separated by an interval and apart <em>(adhika).</em> Some say that the ear has a contiguous objective field. If it did, then sound born of consciousness would not be the object of ear-consciousness, for there is no arising externally of what is consciousness-originated. And in the texts sound as object is spoken of as being the object of ear-consciousness without making any distinction. Besides, there would be no defining the direction and position of the sound because it would then have to be apprehended in the place occupied by the possessor of the objective field, as happens in the case of an odour. Consequently it remains in the same place where it arose, if it comes into focus in the ear avenue (so the Burmese ed.). Are not the sounds of washermen [beating their washing on stones] heard later by those who stand at a distance? No; because there is a difference in the way of apprehending a sound according to the ways in which it becomes evident to one nearby and to one at a distance. For just as, because of difference in the way of apprehending the sound of words according to the ways in which it becomes evident to one at a distance and to one nearby, there comes to be [respectively] not apprehending, and apprehending of the differences in the syllables, so also, when the sound of washermen (a) becomes [an occurrence] that is evident throughout from beginning to end to one who is nearby, and (b) becomes an occurrence that is evident in compressed form in the end or in the middle to one who is at a distance, it is because there is a difference in the apprehending and definition, which occur later in the cognitive series of ear-consciousness, that there comes to be the assumption <em>(abhimāna)</em> ‘Heard faintly is heard later.’ But that sound comes into the ear’s focus at the moment of its own existence and in dependence on the place where it arises (see XIII. 112; <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs-a"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs-a</span></a> <em>313</em>). If there is absolutely no successive becoming of sound, how does an echo arise? The sound, though it remains at a distance, is a condition for the arising of an echo and for the vibration of vessels, etc., elsewhere as a magnet <em>(ayo-kanta)</em> is for the movement of iron” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>446–447</em>).</p>

<p>Ee reads <em>añnamaññaṃ saṅkaro natthi.</em> Ae omits <em>saṅkaro natthi.</em> The word <em>saṅkara</em> in the sense of “confounding” or “error” is not in PED; see Vism concluding verses, PTS ed., p. 711:</p>
<p>“Though these things, that is to say, the ‘mark … of the female,’ etc., arise each due to its own condition consisting in kamma, etc., they mostly only do so as modes in a continuity accompanied by the femininity faculty. And so ‘it is manifested as the reason for the mark,’ etc., is said making the femininity faculty their cause.</p>
<p>“As regards the ‘mark of the female,’ etc., too, its ‘facultiness’ is stated as predominance, in other words, as a state of cause, because the conditions for the modal matter (<em>ākāra-rūpa</em>) consisting of the mark of the female, etc., in a continuity accompanied by faculties do not arise otherwise, and because these kinds of materiality are a condition for apprehending the female. But because the femininity faculty does not generate even the material instances in its own group or maintain or consolidate them, and because it does not so act for the material instances of other groups, it is therefore not called in the text faculty, presence, and non-disappearance conditions, as the life faculty is for the material instances of its group, and as nutriment is for the material instances in succeeding groups. And it is because the mark, etc., are dependent on other conditions that wherever they have predominance its shape is encountered, even in dead and sculptured matter that resembles it. And so too with the masculinity faculty.</p>
<p>“And since these two do not occur together in a single continuity, because of the words, ‘Does the masculinity faculty arise in one in whom the femininity faculty arises?—No’ (Yamaka), etc., therefore even in a hermaphrodite there is only one of them at a given moment (see also <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs-a"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs-a</span></a> <em>323</em>)” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>448</em>).</p>

<p>“Since the life faculty is itself entirely kamma-born it is established, by taking them as conascent, that the things to be protected by it are kamma-born too; this is why there is no inclusion of the term ‘kamma-born.’ It maintains as if it were its own that kamma-born matter by being the cause of its occurrence even though only lasting for a moment; that is why it has the characteristic of maintaining conascent kinds of matter. For kamma alone is not competent to be the cause of kamma-born things” presence, as nutriment, etc., are of the nutriment-born. Why? Because it is no longer existent at that moment.</p>
<p>“‘Because it does accomplish each of those functions’: it does so because it is a condition for distinguishing what is living. For it is the life faculty that distinguishes matter that is bound up with faculties from dead matter, and kamma-born matter and what is bound up with that from matter that is temperature originated, and so on.</p>

<p>“‘The heart-basis … the support for the mind-element and for the mind-consciousness-element’: how is that to be known? (i) From scriptures and (ii) from logical reasoning.</p>
<p>“The scripture is this: ‘The materiality dependent on which the mind-element and mind-consciousness-element occur is a condition, as a support condition, for the mind-element and the mind-consciousness-element and what is associated therewith’ (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patth"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭṭh</span></a> <a class="reference internal" href="ch-01.xhtml#i-4"><span class="std std-ref">I.4</span></a>). If that is so, why is it not mentioned in the Rūpakaṇḍa of the Dhammasaṅgaṇi? (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>§583ff.</em>). Its not being mentioned there is for another reason. What is that? Non-inconsistency of the teaching. For while eye consciousness, etc., have the eye, etc., as their respective supports absolutely, mind-consciousness does not in the same way have the heart-basis as its support absolutely. And the teaching in the physical-basis dyad <em>(vatthu-duka)</em> is given by way of the material support thus, ‘There is matter that is the physical basis of eye-consciousness, there is matter that is not the physical basis of eye-consciousness’ (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs</span></a> <em>§585</em>) and so on; and if the dyads were stated by way of what had the heart-basis absolutely as its support thus, ‘There is matter that is the physical basis of mind-consciousness’ and so on, then the object dyads <em>(ārammaṇa-duka)</em> do not fall into line: for one cannot say: ‘There is matter that is the object of mind-consciousness, there is matter that is not the object of mind-consciousness.’ So the physical-basis dyads and object dyads being thus made inconsistent, the teaching would lack unity, and the Master’s wish was to give the teaching here in a form that has unity. That is why the heart-basis is not mentioned, not because it is unapprehendable.</p>
<p>“(ii) But the logical reasoning should be understood in this way. In the five constituent becoming, [that is, in the sense sphere and fine-material sphere,] these two elements have as their support produced <em>(nipphanna)</em> derived matter. Herein, since the visible-data base, etc., and nutritive essence, are found to occur apart from what is bound up with faculties, to make them the support would be illogical. And since these two elements are found in a continuity that is devoid of the femininity and masculinity faculties [i.e. in the Brahmā-world], to make them the support would be illogical too. And in the case of the life faculty that would have to have another function, so to make it the support would be illogical too. So it is the heart-basis that remains to be recognized as their support. For it is possible to say that these two elements have as their support produced derived matter, since existence is bound up with matter in the five-constituent becoming. Whatever has its existence bound up with matter is found to have as its support produced derived matter, as the eye-consciousness-element does. And the distinction ‘in the five-constituent becoming’ is made on account of the mind-consciousness-element; in the four-constituent becoming, [that is, the immaterial sphere,] there is no mind-element. Does there not follow contradiction of the middle term <em>(hetu)</em> because of establishing faculties as their support? No; because that is disproved by what is seen. For these two elements are not, as in the case of eye-consciousness, controlled by the slackness and keenness, etc., of their physical basis; and accordingly it is not said in the texts that they have the faculties as their condition. Hence their having faculties as their support, in other words, their being controlled by them, is disproved.</p>
<p>“Granted that these two elements have as their support the derived matter consisting of the heart-basis, how is it to be known that it is kamma-originated, has an invariable function, and is to be found located in the heart? It may be said to be kamma-originated because, like the eye, it is the materiality of a physical basis; and because of that it has an invariable function; because it is the materiality of a physical basis and because it is a support for consciousness, is the meaning. It is known that its location is there because of the heart’s exhaustion <em>(khijjana)</em> in one who thinks of anything, bringing it to mind intently and directing his whole mind to it” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>449–450</em>).</p>
<p>The word <em>hadaya</em> (heart), used in a purely mental and not physical sense, occurs in the definitions of the mind-element and mind-consciousness-element in the Vibhaṅga (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vibh"><span class="xref std std-term">Vibh</span></a> <em>88–89</em>). The brain <em>(matthaluṅga),</em> which seems to have been first added as the 32nd part of the body in the Paṭisambhidā (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patis"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭis</span></a> <em>I 7</em>), was ignored, and the <em>Visuddhimagga</em> is hard put to it to find a use for it. The Piṭakas (e.g. <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Patth"><span class="xref std std-term">Paṭṭh</span></a> 1,4 quoted above) connect the mind with the matter of the body without specifying.</p>

<p>“It is the mode and the alteration of what? Of consciousness-originated primary elements that have the air-element in excess of capability. What is that capability? It is the state of being consciousness-born and the state of being derived matter. Or alternatively, it can be taken as the mode alteration of the air element. If that is so, then intimation is illogical as derived matter, for there is no derived matter with a single primary as its support, since ‘matter derived from the four great primaries’ (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>I 53</em>) is said. That is not wrong. Alteration of one of the four is that of all four, as with wealth shared among four. And excess of air element in a material group <em>(kalāpa)</em> does not contradict the words ‘of the air element’; and excess is in capability, not in quantity, otherwise their inseparability would be illogical. According to some it is that of the air element only. In their opinion the state of derived matter is inapplicable <em>(durupapāda)</em> to intimation, since the alteration of one is not that of all. But this [air element] is apprehended by mind-door impulsion that is next to the non-intimating [apprehension] that is next to the apprehension of the appearance of motion in the movement of the hands, and so on. There is a certain kind of alteration that is separate from the appearance of motion. And the apprehension of the former is next to the apprehension of the latter. How is that to be known? By the apprehension of intention. For no apprehension of intention such as, ‘He is getting this done, it seems’ is met with in the case of trees’ movements, etc., which are devoid of intention. But it is met with in the case of hand movements and so on. Therefore there is a certain kind of alteration that is separate from the appearance of motion, and it is known as the ‘intimator of the intention.’ Also it is known by inference that the apprehension of the alteration is next to the apprehension of the appearance thus: The intimator intimates the meaning to be intimated only when it is apprehended as a cause, not merely as present. For they say accordingly:</p>
<p>Sounds that have entered no objective field Do not awaken any kind of meaning; And also beings merely recognized As such communicate no meanings either.</p>
<p>“If just the apprehension of the alteration is the reason for the apprehension of the intention, why is there no apprehension of intention in unapprehended communication <em>(saṅketa)ī</em> It is not only just the apprehension of the alteration that is the reason for the apprehension of the intention; but rather it should be taken that the apprehension of the previously-established connection is the decisive support for this. The stiffening, upholding, and movement are due to the air-element associated with the alteration belonging to the intimation, is what is said. What, is it all the air-element that does all those things? It is not like that. For it is the air element given rise to by the seventh impulsion that, by acquiring as its reinforcing conditions the air elements given rise to by the preceding impulsions, moves consciousness-originated matter by acting as cause for its successive arisings in adjacent locations, *(desantaruppatti—*cf. <a class="reference internal" href="ch-08.xhtml#viii"><span class="std std-ref">Ch. VIII</span></a>, n. 54) not the others. The others, however, help it by doing the stiffening and upholding, the successive arising in adjacent locations being itself the movement. So the instrumentality should be taken as attributed when there is the sign [of movement]; otherwise there would not be uninterestedness and momentariness of dhammas. And here the cart to be drawn by seven yokes is given as simile in the Commentary. But when consciousness-born matter moves, the kinds of matter born of temperature, kamma, and nutriment move too because they are bound up with it, like a piece of dry cow-dung thrown into a river’s current.</p>
<p>“Since it has been said that the apprehension of intimation is next to the apprehension of the appearance of motion, how then, is the air element itself as the maker of the movement accompanied by the alteration consisting in the intimation? It is not like that. It is the air elements given rise to by the first impulsion, etc., and which are unable to cause movement in that way and perform only the stiffening and upholding, that should be taken as only accompanied by the alteration belonging to intimation. For it is the alteration coexistent with the intention that is the intimation, because of giving rise to alteration in whatever direction it wishes to cause the occurrence of moving forward and so on. Taking it in this way, it is perfectly logical to say that the origination of intimation belongs to mind-door adverting. Since the intention possessed of the aforesaid alteration is intimated through the apprehension of that alteration, it is said that ‘Its function is to display intention.’ The air element being the cause of the motion of the bodily intimation, is figuratively said, as a state of alteration, to be ‘manifested as the cause of bodily motion.’ ‘Its proximate cause is the consciousness-originated air-element’ is said since the air element’s excessive function is the cause of intimating intention by movement of the body” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>450–452</em>).

<p>“The question, ‘It is the mode and the alteration of what?,’ should be handled in the same way as for bodily intimation, with this difference: for ‘next to the apprehension of the appearance of movement’ substitute ‘next to the hearing of an audible sound.’ And here, because of the absence of stiffening, etc., the argument beginning, ‘For it is the air element given rise to by the seventh impulsion’ does not apply; for the sound arises together with the knocking together, and the knocking together only applies in the case of the first impulsion, and so on. The knocking together is the arising of groups of primaries <em>(bhūta-kalāpa)</em> in proximity to each other due to conditions. The movement is the progression of the successive arising in adjacent locations. This is the difference.

<p><em>“‘Sensed (muta)’</em> means apprehendable by sensing <em>(mutvā),</em> by reaching; hence he said <em>‘because they are the objective fields of faculties that take contiguous [objective fields]’</em> (cf. §46). But what is it that is called a tangible datum? It is the three elements, earth, heat, and air. But why is the water element not included here? Is not cold apprehended by touching; and that is the water element? Certainly it is apprehended but it is not the water element. What is it then? It is just the fire element. For there is the sensation <em>(buddhi)</em> of cold when heat is sluggish. There is no quality that is called cold; there is only the assumption <em>(abhimāna)</em> of coldness due to the sluggishness of the state of heat. How is that to be known? Because of the unreliability of the sensation of cold, like ‘beyond and not beyond.’ For in hot weather, while those who stand in the sun and go into the shade have the sensation of cold, yet those who go to the same place from an underground cave have the sensation of heat. And if coldness were the water element it would be found in a single group <em>(kalāpa)</em> along with heat; but it is not so found. That is why it may be known that coldness is not the water element. And that is conclusive <em>(uttara)</em> for those who agree to the inseparable existence of the primary elements; and it is conclusive too even for those who do not agree because it is disproved by associate existence through seeing the functions of the four primaries in a single group. It is conclusive too for those who say that coldness is the characteristic of the air element; for if coldness were the air element, coldness would be found in a single group along with heat, and it is not so found. That is why it may be known that coldness is not the air element either. But those who hold the opinion that fluidity <em>(dravatā)</em> is the water element and that that is apprehended by touching should be told: ‘That fluidity touched is merely the venerable ones’ assumption as is the case with shape.’ For this is said by the Ancients:</p>
<p>‘Three elements coexisting with fluidity Together form what constitutes a tangible; That “I succeed in touching this fluidity” Is a common misconception in the world. And as a man who touches elements, And apprehends a shape then with his mind, Fancies “I really have been touching shape,” So too fluidity is recognized’” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>459</em>).</p>

<p>“‘<em>The sound base only’:</em> here some say, ‘The consciousness-born is always intimative <em>(saviññattika).’</em> The Ancients say, ‘There is sound due to the intervention <em>(vipphāra)</em> of applied thought that does not intimate.’ While depending on the word of the Great Commentary that puts it thus, ‘Intimatable (cognizable) through the ear by means of the sound due to applied thought’s intervention,’ still there is also need of the arising of consciousness-originated sound without intimation (cognition) for because of the words, ‘For the intimation (cognition) is not due to intimating speech’ (?), it arises together with sound not intimatable (cognizable) through the ear. That being so, there would have to be a consciousness-born sound-ennead. And that theory is rejected by Saṅghakaras who imagine that it is self-contradictory to say that there is sound not intimatable (cognizable) through the ear. Others, however, do not reject the Great Commentary’s statement and they comment on its intention. How? [They say that] the non-intimation (non-cognition) through the ear of the sound activated due to applied thought’s intervention is stated in the Suttas with this intention, ‘He tells by hearing with the divine ear the subtle sound that is conascent with the intimation, originated by applied thought, and consisting in movement of the tongue and palate, and so on’ (cf. <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-A"><span class="xref std std-term">A</span></a> <em>I 171</em>), and that in the Paṭṭhāna (Paṭṭh 1, 7) the state of object condition for ear-consciousness is stated with reference to gross sound” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>460</em>).</p>

Possibly, a better rendering would have been “cognizance” throughout. It carries a flavour of its etymological relative, <em>cetanā</em> (“volition”). <em>Ceto</em> (another etymological relative, rendered by “heart”—i.e. “seat of the emotions,”—“will” or “mind”), when used loosely is very near to <em>citta;</em> but technically it is restricted to one or two such expressions as <em>ceto-vimutti</em> (“mind-deliverance” or “heart-deliverance”).</p>

<p>The meaning of the expression <em>tathābhāva-paccupaṭṭhāna</em> appears more clearly where it is used again at §108. In this definition <em>(sādhana)</em> the function <em>(kicca-rasa)</em> in fact describes the verb action <em>(kicca)</em> while the manifestation <em>(paccupaṭṭhāna)</em> describes the relevant nounal state <em>(bhāva).</em> So <em>“tathābhāva”</em> means that what has just been taken as a function (e.g. “receiving”) is to be taken also as a state (“reception”).</p>

It is made known through the Suttas in the way beginning ‘Was I in the past?’ (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>I 8</em>); for the past state is likewise mentioned as ‘extent’ in the Bhaddekaratta Sutta too in the way beginning, ‘He does not follow what is past (the past extent)’ (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-M"><span class="xref std std-term">M</span></a> <em>III 1</em> 88). But when it is delimited in the ultimate sense as in the Addhāniruttipatha Sutta thus, ‘Bhikkhus, there are three extents, the past extent, the future extent, and the present extent’ (It 53), then it is appropriate as delimited by moment. Herein, the existingness of the present is stated thus, ‘Bhikkhus, of matter that is born … manifested, it is said that: “It exists”’ (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>IV 72</em>), and pastness and futureness are respectively called before and after that” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>496</em>).</p>

<p>“Cold temperature is like with cold, and hot with hot. But that temperature which falls on the body, whether hot or cold, and occurs as a continuity in one mode, being neither less nor more, is called ‘single temperature.’ The word ‘single’ is used because of the plurality of ‘like’ temperature. So too with nutriment. <em>‘In one cognitive series, in one impulsion’</em> refers respectively to five-door and mind-door consciousness. The explanations of <em>continuity</em> and <em>period</em> are given in the Commentaries for the purpose of helping the practice of insight” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>496</em>).</p>

<p>“‘<em>Cause’ (hetu)</em> is what gives birth <em>(janaka); ‘condition’ (paccaya)</em> is what consolidates <em>(upatthambhaka).</em> Their respective functions are arousing and consolidating. Just as the seed’s function is to arouse the sprout and that of the earth, etc., is to consolidate it, and just as kamma’s function is to arouse result as matter that is due to kamma performed, and that of nutriment is to consolidate it, so the function of those [conditions] that give birth to each material group and each thought-arising and serve as kamma and proximity-conditions, etc., for them, and the function of those that consolidate them and serve as conascence, prenascence, and postnascence conditions for them may be construed accordingly as appropriate.</p>
<p>“Because there is similarity and dissimilarity in temperature, etc., in the way stated, the pastness, etc., of material instances originated by it are stated according to continuity. But there is no such similarity and dissimilarity in the kamma that gives birth to a single becoming, so instead of stating according to continuity the pastness, etc., of material instances originated by that, it is stated according to what consolidates. However, when there comes to be reversal of sex, then the male sex disappears owing to powerful unprofitable kamma, and the female sex appears owing to weak profitable kamma; and the female sex disappears owing to weak unprofitable kamma, while the male sex appears owing to powerful profitable kamma (see <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Dhs-a"><span class="xref std std-term">Dhs-a</span></a> <em>321</em>). So there is in fact dissimilarity in what is originated by kamma and consequent dissimilarity in what is past, etc., in accordance with the continuity of these as well.

<p>“When all formed dhammas are grouped together according to similarity, they naturally fall into five aggregates. Herein, it is the items that are the same owing to the sameness consisting respectively in ‘molesting,’ etc., that are to be understood as ‘similar.’ Among them, those that are strong in the volition whose nature is accumulating with the function of forming the formed, are called the formations aggregate. And the others, that is, contact, etc., which are devoid of the distinguishing characteristics of ‘being molested,’ etc., may also be so regarded under the generality of forming the formed. But the similarities consisting in touching are not describable separately by the word ‘aggregate,’ and so that is why no aggregates of contact, etc., have been stated by the Perfect One who knows the similarities of dhammas. ‘Bhikkhus, whatever ascetics or brahmans there are who are asserters of eternity and declare the self and the world to be eternal, all do so depending and relying on these same five aggregates or on one or other of them’ (cf. <a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-S"><span class="xref std std-term">S</span></a> <em>IV 46</em>), and so on” (<a class="reference internal" href="front-B.xhtml#term-Vism-mht"><span class="xref std std-term">Vism-mhṭ</span></a> <em>503</em>).</p>
